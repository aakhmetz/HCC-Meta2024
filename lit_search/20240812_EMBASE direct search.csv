Also unclear is whether the drugs are effective at preventing viral reactivation or HCC recurrence after hepatectomy to treat HBV-associated HCC. This trial will compare recurrence-free survival, overall survival, viral indicators and adverse events in the long term between patients with HBV-associated HCC who receive entecavir or TDF after curative resection. Methods: This study is a randomized, open-label trial. A total of 240 participants will be randomized 1:1 into groups receiving TDF or entecavir monotherapy. The two groups will be compared in terms of recurrence-free and overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery; adverse events; virological response; rate of alanine transaminase normalization; and seroreactivity at 24 and 48 weeks after surgery. Discussion: This study will compare long-term survival between patients with HBV-associated HCC who receive TDF or entecavir monotherapy.

Here, we examine the single-cell transcriptional and TCR profiles of 18 tumor tissues pre- and post- therapy of gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin, in combination with lenvatinib and anti-PD1 antibody for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. We find that high CD8 GZMB(+) and CD8 proliferating proportions and a low Macro CD5L(+) proportion predict good response to the therapy. In patients with a poor response, the CD8 GZMB(+) and CD8 proliferating proportions are increased, but the CD8 GZMK(+) proportion is decreased after the therapy. Transition of CD8 proliferating and CD8 GZMB(+) to CD8 GZMK(+) facilitates good response to the therapy, while Macro CD5L(+)–CD8 GZMB(+) crosstalk impairs the response by increasing CTLA4 in CD8 GZMB(+). Anti-CTLA4 antibody reverses resistance of the therapy in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

"Surrogacy of one-year survival for overall survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma","Jin Y., Ren H., Yue Q., Wu W., Liu C., Guo Y., Zhao P.","BMC Cancer (2024) 24:1 Article Number: 258. Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2024","2024","24","1",,,"1 Dec 2024","Background: The increasing number of sequential treatments complicates the evaluation of overall survival (OS) in clinical trials for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), therefore, reliable surrogate endpoints (SEs) are required. This study aimed to evaluate the surrogacy of progression-free survival (PFS) and one-year (1-yr) milestone survival for OS in HCC trials. Methods: We systematically searched databases for randomized clinical trials that evaluated systemic treatments for advanced HCC. Individual patient data were reconstructed to calculate the 1-yr survival rate. We adopted a two-stage meta-analytic validation model to evaluate the correlation between SEs and OS, and the correlation between treatment effects on SEs and OS. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated to assess the treatment effects on PFS and OS, and the 1-yr survival ratio was calculated to evaluate the treatment effects on the 1-yr milestone survival. Results: Thirty-two HCC trials involving 13,808 patients were included. A weak correlation was detected between the median PFS and median OS (R2 = 0.32), whereas the correlation improved between PFS HR and OS HR (R2 = 0.58). We identified strong correlations between the 1-yr survival rate and median OS and between the 1-yr survival ratio and OS HR (R2 = 0.74 and 0.65, respectively). In subgroup analyses, PFS HR strongly correlated with OS HR in trials relevant to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Although the correlation remained weak between PFS and OS even in trials with PFS HR ≤ 0.6, the 1-yr survival rate and 1-yr survival ratio were strong surrogates for median OS and OS HR, respectively (R2 = 0.77 and 0.75). Conclusions: One-year milestone survival outperformed PFS as a SE for OS in HCC, indicating the application of 1-yr survival as a secondary endpoint. In particular, PFS HR was a potential SE for OS HR in the ICI trials.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00105443, NCT00108953, NCT00492752, NCT00699374, NCT00825955, NCT01009593, NCT01015833, NCT01075555, NCT01140347, NCT01210495, NCT01214343, NCT01287585, NCT01507168, NCT01755767, NCT01761266, NCT01774344, NCT01829035, NCT01908426, NCT02029157, NCT02329860, NCT02435433, NCT02528643, NCT02576509, NCT02702401, NCT02774187, NCT03009461, NCT03434379, NCT0901901)",,38395854,L2028714537,10.1186/s12885-024-12000-7

This study endeavors to delve into the potential peripheral biomarkers capable of prognosticating efficacy in HCC patients who are poised to receive anti-PD-1 monotherapy within the phase III clinical trial, KEYNOTE394. Additionally, we sought to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms for resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and propose innovative combination immunotherapy strategies for future clinical application. Methods: Patient blood samples were collected for single-cell RNA sequencing to evaluate the immune cell signature before receiving ICB therapy. Subsequently, in vitro assays and in vivo murine model experiments were conducted to validate the mechanism that S100A9(+)CD14(+) monocytes play a role in ICB resistance. Results: Our study demonstrates a notable enrichment of S100A9(+)CD14(+) monocytes in the peripheral blood of patients exhibiting suboptimal responses to anti-PD-1 therapy. Moreover, we identified the Mono_S100A9 signature as a predictive biomarker, indicative of reduced efficacy in immunotherapy and decreased survival benefits across various tumor types. Mechanistically, S100A9 activates PD-L1 transcription by directly binding to the CD274 (PD-L1) gene promoter, thereby suppressing T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity via the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, consequently diminishing the therapeutic effectiveness of subsequent anti-PD-1 treatments. Furthermore, our in vivo studies revealed that inhibiting S100A9 can synergistically enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1 drugs in the eradication of hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusions: Our study underscores the significance of S100A9(+)CD14(+) monocytes in predicting inadequate response to ICB treatment and provides insights into the monocyte cell-intrinsic mechanisms of resistance to ICB therapy. We also propose a combined therapeutic approach to enhance ICB efficacy by targeting S100A9.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02576509, NCT02989922, NCT03062358, NCT03412773)",,38454445,L2028915656,10.1186/s13046-024-02985-1

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, camrelizumab combined with an anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) apatinib, have emerged as a first-line treatment option for patients with unresectable HCC, yet its neoadjuvant application in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HCC remains unexplored. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of sequential TACE, camrelizumab, and apatinib as a neoadjuvant therapy for single, huge HCC. Methods: This multi-center, open-label randomized phase 3 trial will be conducted at 7 tertiary hospitals. Patients with single huge (≥ 10 cm in diameter), resectable HCC will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to arm of surgery alone or arm of neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery. In the neoadjuvant therapy group, patients will receive TACE within 1 week after randomization, followed by camrelizumab (200 mg q2w, 4 cycles), along with apatinib (250 mg qd, 2 months). Patients will receive liver resection after neoadjuvant therapy unless the disease is assessed as progressive. The primary outcome is recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 1 year. The planned sample size of 60 patients will be calculated to permit the accumulation of sufficient RFS events in 1 year to achieve 80% power for the RFS primary endpoint. Discussion: Synergistic effects provided by multimodality therapy of locoregional treatment, TKI, and anti-programmed cell death 1 inhibitor significantly improved overall survival for patients with unresectable HCC.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2024","2024","50",,,,"1 Sep 2024","Background: Annual Chinese National negotiations for including innovative drugs in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) reveal an increasing number of new drugs with overlapping action mechanisms of action and similar indications. Yet, it is unclear if competition affects reimbursement decisions. Thus, we explored the impact of competition on reimbursement decisions for cancer drugs in China. Methods: We identified the cancer drugs involved in NRDL negotiations from 2017 to 2022 and focused on the initial reimbursement decision for eligible newly negotiated drugs. Drugs were classified as within-class competitors based on their equivalent biological mechanisms of action and approved indications, including identified and potential competitors. Other variables included drug type, clinical benefit and safety, monthly drug cost, and disease incidence rate. We employed traditional univariate and multivariate Firth's penalized logistic regression to assess the association between reimbursement decisions and variables at the indication and drug levels. Findings: Between 2017 and 2022, 102 cancer drugs corresponding to 141 indications were studied, and 66 drugs (64.7%) covering 95 indications (67.4%) were added to the NRDL. The proportion of reimbursements for indications with identified competition was significantly higher than that for indications without identified competition (84.6% vs 52.6%, p < 0.0001). However, the difference in reimbursement proportions between groups with and without potential competition was not statistically significant (66.7% vs 68.3%, p = 0.84). Firth's penalized logistic regression showed that identified competition was positively correlated with successful NRDL inclusion, whereas potential competition had no significant effect on negotiation outcomes. Improved overall survival or progression-free survival were positively associated with NRDL inclusion, whereas disease incidence negatively impacted reimbursement decisions. Interpretation: Improved clinical benefit and identified competition were positively correlated with NRDL inclusion. In China's value-based negotiation model, clinical benefits served as a crucial foundation of price negotiation for cancer drugs, and market competition helped these drugs enter the NRDL at more reasonable prices. This has important implications for reimbursement decisions and accessibility and affordability improvement for innovative drugs worldwide.

MYCN gene expression in HCC was analyzed in the Cancer Genome Atlas and a Taiwanese cohort (N = 118). Serum MYCN protein levels were assessed in healthy controls (N = 15), patients with HCC (N = 116), pre- and post-surgical patients with HCC (N = 20), and a subset of patients from a phase 3 clinical trial of ACR (N = 68, NCT01640808). The results showed increased MYCN gene expression in HCC tumors, which positively correlated with HCC recurrence in non-cirrhotic or single-tumor patients. Serum MYCN protein levels were higher in patients with HCC, decreased after surgical resection of HCC, and were associated with liver functional reserve and fibrosis markers, as well as long-term HCC prognosis (>4 years). Subgroup analysis of a phase 3 clinical trial of ACR identified serum MYCN as the risk factor most strongly associated with HCC recurrence. Patients with HCC with higher serum MYCN levels after a 4-week treatment of ACR exhibited a significantly higher risk of recurrence (hazard ratio 3.27; p =.022).

HBV is the predominant HCC aetiology in most of Asia vs. HCV or nonviral aetiologies in Western countries and Japan. This analysis evaluated safety and efficacy outcomes for STRIDE and durvalumab monotherapy vs. sorafenib, in HIMALAYA participants enrolled in Asia, excluding Japan. METHODS: In HIMALAYA, participants were randomised to STRIDE, durvalumab, or sorafenib. The Asian subgroup in this analysis included participants enrolled in Hong Kong, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. OS, objective response rate (ORR; per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1), and safety were assessed in the Asian subgroup and in an exploratory subgroup of participants in Hong Kong and Taiwan. RESULTS: The Asian subgroup included 479 participants randomised to STRIDE (n=156), durvalumab (n=167), or sorafenib (n=156). OS was improved for STRIDE vs. sorafenib (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.52-0.89]). The OS HR for durvalumab vs. sorafenib was 0.83 (95% CI 0.64-1.06). In Hong Kong and Taiwan (n=141), OS HRs for STRIDE vs. sorafenib and durvalumab vs. sorafenib were 0.44 (95% CI 0.26-0.77) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.37-1.08), respectively. In the Asian subgroup, ORR (including unconfirmed responses) was numerically higher for STRIDE (28.2%) and durvalumab (18.6%) vs. sorafenib (9.0%), and Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were numerically lower for STRIDE (19.9%) and durvalumab (13.3%) vs. sorafenib (30.5%). CONCLUSIONS: STRIDE improved outcomes vs. sorafenib in the Asian subgroup. These results support the benefits of STRIDE for participants with uHCC globally, including the Asia-Pacific region.

Immunotherapy has become a promising approach due to its ability to affect the immune microenvironment and promote antitumor responses. The immune microenvironment performs an essential role in both the progression and the development of HCC, with different characteristics based on specific immune cells and etiological factors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and durvalumab) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibitors (tremelimumab and ipilimumab), have the potential to treat advanced HCC and overcome adverse effects, such as liver failure and chemoresistance. Phase II and phase III clinical trials highlight the efficacy of pembrolizumab and nivolumab, respectively, in advanced HCC patients, as demonstrated by their positive effects on overall survival and progression-free survival. Tremelimumab has exhibited modest response rates, though it does possess antiviral activity. Thus, it is still being investigated in ongoing clinical trials. Combination therapies with multiple drugs have demonstrated potential benefits in terms of survival and tumor response rates, improving patient outcomes compared to monotherapy, especially for advanced-stage HCC.

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2024","2024","205",,,,"1 Jul 2024","Health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) data are central to capturing the quality of patients’ life, while endpoints like overall survival (OS) focus on the quantity of life. When analyzing HRQoL data gathered from patients in a randomized trial, a key consideration is the completion rate – indicating the proportion of patients remaining in the trial and with completed questionnaires. When completion rates are disproportionately low in one treatment arm, one likely explanation is that patients who did not complete questionnaires suffered more from toxicities, negatively impacting their HRQoL. This is likely the case when low completion rates occur in the more toxic arm within a randomized trial. If the HRQoL analysis is run as a complete-case analysis – only considering patients without missing data – a decrement in HRQoL can be missed. Conversely, when completion rates are high, the HRQoL data are thought to be more reliable, and informative censoring is less likely. We describe why this reasoning can be inadequate. In trials where high and imbalanced rates of early censoring affect progression-free survival or OS endpoints, the completion rates only apply to the fraction of patients remaining in the trial. In those, HRQoL results should be considered with caution, and reasons for censoring in the primary time-to-event analyses should be explored before making definite conclusions about HRQoL. This is even more relevant in trials with non-inferiority design, where a benefit in HRQoL could be used as a justification to modify practice.",,,38718724,L2032080318,10.1016/j.ejca.2024.114105

This trial was conducted at 5 hospitals in China, and enrolled patients from October 2019 to December 2021, with a follow-up period of 24 months. Data were analyzed from June 2023 to September 2023. Interventions: Randomization to on-demand TACE (conventional TACE: doxorubicin, 50 mg, mixed with lipiodol and gelatin sponge particles [diameter: 150-350 μm]; drug-eluting bead TACE: doxorubicin, 75 mg, mixed with drug-eluting particles [diameter: 100-300 μm or 300-500 μm]) (TACE group) or sorafenib, 400 mg, twice daily plus on-demand TACE (SOR-TACE group) (conventional TACE: doxorubicin, 50 mg, mixed with lipiodol and gelatin sponge particles [diameter, 150-350 μm]; drug-eluting bead TACE: doxorubicin, 75 mg, mixed with drug-eluting particles [diameter: 100-300 μm or 300-500 μm]). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was overall survival by intention-to-treat analysis. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. Results: A total of 162 patients (median [range] age, 55 [28-75] years; 151 males [93.2%]), were randomly assigned to be treated with either SOR-TACE (n = 81) or TACE alone (n = 81). The median overall survival was significantly longer in the SOR-TACE group than in the TACE group (22.2 months vs 15.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; P < .001). SOR-TACE also prolonged progression-free survival (16.2 months vs 11.8 months; HR, 0.54; P < .001), and improved the objective response rate when compared with TACE alone based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (80.2% vs 58.0%; P = .002). Any grade adverse events were more common in the SOR-TACE group, but all adverse events responded well to treatment. No unexpected adverse events or treatment-related deaths occurred in this study. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that SOR-TACE achieved better clinical outcomes than TACE alone. These findings suggest that combined treatment should be used for patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after R0 hepatectomy with positive MVI.

Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib plus transarterial chemoembolization vs sorafenib alone as postoperative adjuvant therapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted in 5 hospitals in China. A total of 158 patients were enrolled and randomized from October 2019 to March 2022, with a median follow-up of 28.4 months. Portal vein tumor thrombus was graded by the Cheng classification. Eligible patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with Cheng grade I to III portal vein tumor thrombus (ie, involving segmental or sectoral branches, right- or left-side branch, or main trunk of portal vein) were included. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib or sorafenib alone as postoperative adjuvant therapy. Sorafenib treatment was started within 3 days after randomization, with an initial dose of 400 mg orally twice a day. In the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group, transarterial chemoembolization was performed 1 day after the first administration of sorafenib. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was recurrence-free survival. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. Results: Of 158 patients included, the median (IQR) age was 54 (43-61) years, and 140 (88.6%) patients were male. The median (IQR) recurrence-free survival was significantly longer in the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group (16.8 [12.0-NA] vs 12.6 [7.8-18.1] months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.83; P =.002). The median (IQR) overall survival was also significantly longer with transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib than with sorafenib alone (30.4 [20.6-NA] vs 22.5 [15.4-NA] months; HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.91; P =.02). The most common grade 3/4 adverse event was hand-foot syndrome (23 of 79 patients in the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group [29.1%] vs 24 of 79 patients in the sorafenib alone group [30.4%]). There were no treatment-related deaths in either group. The transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group did not show additional toxicity compared with the sorafenib monotherapy group.

Interventional radiologists have improved and developed novel protocols and devices for both intratumoural ablative approaches with curative intent and various transarterial intrahepatic treatment options, which have continuously improved patient outcomes. Two large phase III randomised clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of different immune checkpoint inhibitors either as single agents or in combination in the first-line setting and immunotherapy has become the standard first-line treatment option for patients with advanced HCC. Herein, we discuss advances and perspectives in the area of interventional radiology (IR) and immune-oncology (IO). We summarise results from recent studies and provide an overview of ongoing studies in IR and IO. Based on the significant advances in both areas, we propose that IR and IO need to cover the emerging “discipline” of IR-IO, in which we develop and test novel approaches to combine locoregional therapies with immunotherapy, in order to develop sufficient evidence for them to be considered standard of care for patients with HCC in the near future.","ClinicalTrials.gov ((NCT04246177, NCT02240433, NCT02315066, NCT02748837, NCT02947165, NCT03572582, NCT03680508, NCT03755739, NCT03778957, NCT03849469, NCT03864211, NCT04212221, NCT04246177, NCT04268888, NCT04340193, NCT04374877, NCT04522544, NCT04523467, NCT04524871, NCT04559607, NCT04567615, NCT04658147, NCT04712643, NCT04777851, NCT04803994, NCT04814043, NCT04823403, NCT04947826, NCT04975932, NCT04981665, NCT05022927, NCT05042336, NCT05063565, NCT05162898, NCT05171166, NCT05171335, NCT05233358, NCT05250843)",,35988688,L2020648278,10.1016/j.jhep.2022.08.003

The prognosis of patients with advanced, unresectable HCC has historically been poor. However, with the emergence of immunotherapy, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), there is reason for optimism. Nevertheless, ICIs do not come without risk, especially when administered in patients with HCC, given their potential underlying poor hepatic reserve. Given their novelty in the management of HCC, there are few studies to date specifically investigating ICI-related side effects on the liver in patients with underlying HCC. This review will serve as a guide for clinicians on ICIs’ role in the management of HCC and their potential side effect profile. There will be a discussion on ICI-related hepatotoxicity, the potential for hepatitis B and C reactivation with ICI use, the potential for the development of autoimmune hepatitis with ICI use, and the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with ICI use. As ICIs become more commonplace as a treatment option in patients with advanced HCC, it is imperative that clinicians not only understand the mechanism of action of such agents but also understand and are able to identify hepatic-related side effects.",,,,L2030187119,10.3390/cancers16112042

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","128",,,,"1 Jun 2024","Background: c-MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase which is classically activated by HGF to activate its downstream signaling cascades such as MAPK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and STAT3. The c-MET modulates cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), immune response, morphogenesis, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. The c-MET has been shown to serve a prominent role in embryogenesis and early development. The c-MET pathway is deregulated in a broad range of malignancies, due to overexpression of ligands or receptors, genomic amplification, and MET mutations. The link between the deregulation of c-MET signaling and tumor progression has been well-documented. Overexpression or overactivation of c-MET is associated with dismal clinical outcomes and acquired resistance to targeted therapies. Since c-MET activation results in the triggering of oncogenic pathways, abrogating the c-MET pathway is considered to be a pivotal strategy in cancer therapeutics. Herein, an analysis of role of the c-MET pathway in human cancers and its relevance in bone metastasis and therapeutic resistance has been undertaken. Also, an attempt has been made to summarize the inhibitory activity of selected natural compounds towards c-MET signaling in cancers. Methods: The publications related to c-MET pathway in malignancies and its natural compound modulators were obtained from databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar and summarized based on PRISMA guidelines. Some of the keywords used for extracting relevant literature are c-MET, natural compound inhibitors of c-MET, c-MET in liver cancer, c-MET in breast cancer, c-MET in lung cancer, c-MET in pancreatic cancer, c-MET in head and neck cancer, c-MET in bone metastasis, c-MET in therapeutic resistance, and combination of c-MET inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents. The chemical structure of natural compounds was verified in PubChem database. Results: The search yielded 3935 publications, of which 195 reference publications were used for our analysis. Clinical trials were referenced using ClinicalTrials.gov identifier. The c-MET pathway has been recognized as a prominent target to combat the growth, metastasis, and chemotherapeutic resistance in cancers. The key role of the c-MET in bone metastasis as well as therapeutic resistance has been elaborated. Also, suppressive effect of selected natural compounds on the c-MET pathway in clinical/preclinical studies has been discussed.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00027495, NCT00094445, NCT00113841, NCT00192842, NCT00459407, NCT00516243, NCT00666562, NCT00917735, NCT01201694, NCT01317953, NCT01490996, NCT01712542, NCT01859858, NCT01917890, NCT02029352, NCT02064673, NCT02138955, NCT02321293, NCT02439385, NCT02891538, NCT03072992, NCT03192059, NCT03769766, NCT03980509, NCT04300855, NCT04597359, NCT05494112, NCT05768919, NCT05856500, NCT06080841)",,38503157,L2031092795,10.1016/j.phymed.2024.155379

Cancer therapies based on epigenetic modulation have therefore been proposed early on. However, it has produced significant efficacy only in patients with hematological malignancies rather than solid tumors, partly due to the inherent physicochemical properties of the drugs and the impediments to their reaching the tumor cells in vivo. As a result, a growing number of researches have been devoted to extending the use of epigenetic therapies to a wider range of solid tumor treatments by means of drug delivery strategies (DDSs). These studies have provided new insights into the application of epigenetic therapies for cancer and new ideas to address the poor outcome of epigenetic therapy in solid tumors through DDSs. Therefore, this review summarizes the epigenetic factors of cancer, the contribution of the designed DDSs to the anti-tumor treatments (especially solid tumors), the application of different anti-tumor epigenetic therapies based on DDSs, and finally analyses the potential problems in current anti-tumor epigenetic therapies and the great potential of DDSs in their future development.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00002639, NCT00002723, NCT00005624, NCT00042003, NCT00085540, NCT00098397, NCT00112463, NCT00131261, NCT00185302, NCT00278395, NCT00305773, NCT00321594, NCT00323934, NCT00357162, NCT00359086, NCT00359606, NCT00384839, NCT00416130, NCT00431873, NCT00449761, NCT00462605, NCT00667862, NCT00865969, NCT00866333, NCT01013597, NCT01034163, NCT01266057, NCT01350947, NCT01451268, NCT01587703, NCT01606579, NCT01684150, NCT01713582, NCT01752933, NCT01897571, NCT01949883, NCT01987362, NCT02068586, NCT02131597, NCT02157636, NCT02203773, NCT02308761, NCT02348489, NCT02395601, NCT02447666, NCT02711137, NCT02860286, NCT02875548, NCT02907359, NCT03525795, NCT03538171, NCT03703375, NCT05546580)",,,L2031471343,10.1016/j.nantod.2024.102251

In uHCC, liver function is often impaired; TACE may further deteriorate liver function and the underlying liver disease. Here, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of D + B + TACE by liver function in uHCC. Methods: Pts with embolisation-eligible uHCC were randomised 1:1:1 to the D + B + TACE, D + TACE or PBOs + TACE (TACE) arms. Pts received D (1500 mg) or PBO for D (Q4W) + TACE. After completion of last TACE, pts received D (1120 mg) + PBO for B, D (1120 mg) + B (15 mg/kg), or PBOs for D and B (Q3W). PFS and time to progression (TTP) in pts in the D + B + TACE and TACE arms of the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, and safety in pts who received D + B + TACE or TACE in the safety analysis set (SAS; pts who received ≥1 dose of study treatment [tx], by tx received, regardless of randomisation) are reported by albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade (gr) 1 or 2 at baseline (no pts had ALBI gr 3 in the D + B + TACE or TACE arms). Results: Baseline characteristics were generally consistent across tx arms, regardless of ALBI gr. PFS and TTP improved with D + B + TACE vs TACE in the ALBI gr 1 and 2 groups (Table). The rates of tx-emergent hepatic events were numerically higher in pts treated with D + B + TACE vs TACE in the ALBI gr 1 (37.8% vs 19.5%) and 2 (48.4% vs 28.6%) groups, consistent with the longer median duration of exposure (mDoE) to D with D + B + TACE vs TACE (Table); however, these events were predominantly low-grade. Rates of tx-related gr 3 or 4 hepatic events were comparable across tx arms regardless of baseline ALBI gr; no tx-related gr 5 hepatic events occurred in pts treated with D + B + TACE.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","35",,"S4",,"1 Jun 2024","Background: The optimal management of resectable CRCLM remains a matter of debate, and practice in this setting is highly heterogeneous. In particular, the value of post-operative or peri-operative systemic chemotherapy is uncertain, and the relatively small sample size of the available RP3 precludes meaningful survival analyses in the entire population and specific subgroups. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RP3 trials testing surgery plus systemic chemotherapy (given either post-operatively or peri-operatively) versus surgery alone in patients with resectable CRCLM. IPD from the retrieved and accessible trials were pooled in a central database. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and survival outcomes in pre-specified subgroups. The study is sponsored by the EORTC. Results: IPD from 4 RP3 trials (EORTC 40983, FFCD-ACHBTH-AURC 9002, ENG, UMIN C000000013) were collected. Pooling data from the post-operative chemotherapy studies (FFCD, ENG, UMIN C000000013) (n=457), a significant difference in terms of DFS (HR 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61-0.96; p=0.020) and a trend for OS (HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.59-1.03; p=0.076) were observed in favour of the chemotherapy arm. 3-year DFS were 41% and 35%, while 5-year OS were 58% and 52% in the chemotherapy and surgery alone arm, respectively. Pooling these data with those from trials testing a peri-operative chemotherapy strategy (EORTC 40983) (n=821), a significant benefit for PFS (HR 0.79; 95% CI: 0.67-0.93; p=0.004) and a trend for OS (HR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.68-1.00; p=0.052) were confirmed. 3-year DFS were 40% and 33%, while 5-year OS were 55% and 50% in the chemotherapy and surgery alone arm, respectively. Conclusions: This is the largest IPD meta-analysis to date in this setting. Administering systemic chemotherapy (either post-operatively or peri-operatively) to patients with resectable CRCLM reduces significantly the risk of recurrence/progression or death, and is associated with a trend towards a better OS.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","35",,"S76","S77","1 Jun 2024","Background: The phase 3 REFLECT trial showed that LEN was noninferior to sorafenib in OS among pts with uHCC. ORR with LEN was 41%. We characterize pts enrolled in REFLECT who were treated with 1L LEN and experienced complete response (CR), near-CR (nCR; partial response [PR] with target lesion reduction [TLR] ≥ 75%) or PR with other TLR. Methods: Pts who received LEN (bodyweight (BW) ≥ 60 kg: 12 mg/d; BW < 60 kg: 8 mg/d) and were responders (CR/PR) were included in this analysis. Tumor responses were assessed per independent imaging review by mRECIST. Responders were grouped by tumor reduction including CR, nCR (TLR ≥ 75%), PR with TLR ≥ 50-< 75% or ≥ 30-< 50%. Baseline demographics/disease characteristics were summarized by group. Median (m)OS and duration of response (DOR) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method; 95% CIs were estimated with a generalized Brookmeyer and Crowley method. Results: Of the 478 pts with uHCC randomized to LEN, 194 pts had an objective response and were included in this analysis; 10 pts had a CR and 184 pts had a PR (nCR, n=49; PR-TLR ≥ 50-< 75%, n=72; PR-TLR ≥ 30-< 50%, n=63). Baseline demographics/characteristics were generally well balanced. mDOR was 20.3 mos for pts with CR, 7.7 mos for pts with nCR, 7.3 mos for pts with PR-TLR ≥ 50-< 75%, and 3.7 mos for pts with PR-TLR ≥ 30-< 50% (Table). Proportions of pts with DOR ≥ 6, 12, and 18 mos were generally higher in pts with CR and nCR vs pts with PR-TLR ≥ 50-< 75% and PR-TLR ≥ 30-< 50%. mOS was similar for pts with CR (25.4 mos) and nCR (23.4 mos), and higher vs other PR groups. [Formula presented] Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study characterizing pts with uHCC who experienced a nCR and looking at outcomes by depth of responses. Responses were durable, irrespective of TLR. Despite the small sample size for pts with CR (n=10), it was notable that mOS was similar between pts with CR and nCR, indicating that a deeper tumor response may be associated with survival. These results further support LEN as a standard-of-care 1L treatment. Clinical trial identification: NCT01761266.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","35",,"S75","S76","1 Jun 2024","Background: STRIDE (Single T Regular Interval D) improved overall survival (OS) versus sorafenib (S) in uHCC overall and across HBV, HCV and other (no active viral hepatitis) aetiologies in the phase 3 HIMALAYA study (Sangro et al. Ann Oncol 2024). Non-viral uHCC aetiology prevalence is increasing worldwide. Thus, we aimed to further characterise the non-viral uHCC aetiology subgroup in HIMALAYA. Methods: This exploratory analysis assessed STRIDE, D or S in participants (pts) with non-viral aetiology, here, more specifically defined as no active viral hepatitis or prior HBV infection. Self-reported alcohol use (yes [former/current] vs no [never]), history of metabolic/diabetes comorbidities, OS and safety were assessed. OS hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Data cut-off was 23 Jan 2023. Results: The non-viral subgroup included 388 pts randomised to STRIDE, D or S; 245 (63%) pts reported alcohol use (Table). Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across treatment arms. Non-viral aetiology and alcohol use were more common in Western countries than in Asia, per known trends. History of metabolic/diabetes comorbidities were observed in 147/245 (60%) pts with and 64/142 (45%) without alcohol use. OS was improved, and 36- and 48-mo OS rates were higher for STRIDE and D, versus S, in the non-viral subgroup. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were lower for STRIDE and D versus S in the non-viral subgroup (Table) and were consistent with previously reported rates. [Formula presented] Conclusions: STRIDE continued to demonstrate an OS benefit in a more strictly defined non-viral aetiology subgroup of pts. 36- and 48-mo OS rates remained higher in pts treated with STRIDE versus S, with no new safety signals observed. As rates of non-viral aetiology for HCC rise, these data further support the benefits of STRIDE in a diverse population consistent with uHCC globally. Clinical trial identification: NCT0329845.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","35",,"S136","S137","1 Jun 2024","Background: NAPOLI 3, a global, randomized, phase 3 study, demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for NALIRIFOX vs gemcitabine+nab-Paclitaxel (Gem+NabP) in pts with mPAC. The aim of this post-hoc analysis is to evaluate the effects of NALIRIFOX in the Asian subgroup (AG) of NAPOLI 3. Methods: In the NAPOLI 3 the pts had a confirmed PAC not previously treated in the metastatic setting and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0/1. They were randomized to NALIRIFOX (liposomal irinotecan 50 mg/m(2)+ 5-FU 2400 mg/m(2) + leucovorin 400 mg/m(2)+ oxaliplatin 60 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle) or Gem+NabP (Gem 1000 mg/m(2) + NabP 125 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle). Primary endpoint was OS. Secondary endpoints included PFS, ORR and safety; 383 pts were randomized to NALIRIFOX and 387 to Gem+NabP. Median follow-up was 16.1 months (mts). Results: 38 Asian pts (mean age 60.3 years; 60.5% male) were enrolled from Korean and non-Asian sites. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two treatment arms; Asian pts had a worse ECOG PS and a lower CA 19.9 level vs the general population (GP). In the AG, NALIRIFOX significantly prolonged OS vs Gem+NabP (hazard ratio [HR] 0.31; 95% CI 0.10-0.98). The median OS in NALIRIFOX arm was 14.5 mts in the AG and 11.1 mts in the GP. PFS was also prolonged vs Gem+NabP (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.21–1.60). The median PFS in NALIRIFOX arm was 10 mts in the AG and 7.4 mts in the GP. In the AG, ORR rate was 70% in NALIRIFOX arm and 41.8% in the GP. In the AG, the incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events (≥G3 AEs) in NALIRIFOX arm was 50% and was 62.2% in the GP. In NALIRIFOX arm, the AG had more ≥G3 hematological events than the GP (40% vs 33%) and fewer ≥G3 non-hematological events in the NALIRIFOX arm than the GP (20.0% vs 42.2%) including ≥G3 diarrhea (5% vs 20.3%). Conclusions: The effect of NALIRIFOX in AG was consistent with the GP of NAPOLI 3. NALIRIFOX had a manageable safety profile with a slightly higher incidence of severe hematological events and lower incidence of severe diarrhea. Clinical trial identification: NCT04083235.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","35",,"S79",,"1 Jun 2024","Background: This phase II trial was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of donafenib (a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor derived from sorafenib) plus sintilimab (a PD-1 inhibitor) for advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: This was a single-center, single-arm phase II trial. The key eligibility criteria were as follows: age ≥ 18 years; BCLC stage C HCC; at least one target lesion based on mRECIST and RECIST 1.1; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 1; Child-Pugh score ≤ 7; without involvement of the main portal vein or vena cava; without central nervous system involvement; no prior systemic therapy; and without history of organ or cell transplantation. The study was conducted in two parts. Part 1 (safety run-in): Six patients (pts) received donafenib 200 mg P.O. BID and sintilimab 200 mg I.V. Q3W. If there were 2 or more pts experienced donafenib-related dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), the dose of donafenib would be adjusted to be 200 mg P.O. QD. Part 2: The subsequently enrolled pts received donafenib at the recommended dose determined from Part 1 and sintilimab 200mg I.V. Q3W. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) per mRECIST. Results: 30 pts were enrolled in this study. Among them, 24 (80.0%) had macrovascular invasion, 19 (63.3%) had extrahepatic metastasis and 16 (53.3%) had intrahepatic tumor number > 3. The mean largest tumor diameter was 8.9±3.8 cm. In the safety run-in phase, 3 pts (50.0%) suffered from DLTs. And the dose of donafenib was reduced to 200 mg QD. Till cutoff date (August 31, 2023), the median follow-up for the pts was 16.0 months. The median PFS was 6.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.4-8.0) and 6.3 (95% CI: 5.4-7.2) months per mRECIST and RECIST 1.1, respectively. The objective response rate was 23.3% and 16.7% per mRECIST and RECIST 1.1, respectively. The median overall survival was 16.0 (95% CI: 13.5-18.5) months. TRAEs occurred in 28 pts (93.3%) and grade 3 TRAEs were observed in 9 pts (30.0%). There were no grade 4/5 TRAEs. Conclusions: Donafenib plus sintilimab showed promising clinical benefits and was tolerated in pts with advanced stage HCC. The preliminary findings need to be verified by phase III randomized trials. Clinical trial identification: NCT05162352. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","35",,"S77","S78","1 Jun 2024","Background: In the 4-year analysis of HIMALAYA, STRIDE (Single T Regular Interval D) sustained an overall survival (OS) benefit vs sorafenib (S) and showed further improvement in participants (pts) who achieved disease control (Sangro et al. Ann Oncol 2024). Cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic (MB) CMs are often found in people with HCC and can impact treatment options and outcomes. This exploratory analysis assessed outcomes in pts with CV or MB CMs in HIMALAYA. Methods: CMs were based on medical history reported at baseline and qualified using preferred terms from CV or MB SMQs. Pts with >1 CM were counted once. OS by CMs was assessed in the full analysis set (FAS; pts randomised to STRIDE, D or S), including long-term survivors (LTS; pts alive ≥36 mo beyond randomisation). Within-arm OS HRs and 95% CIs were estimated using the unstratified Cox models. Safety was assessed in the safety analysis set (SAS; pts who received ≥1 dose of study drug). Data cut-off was 23 Jan 2023. Results: Of the FAS, hypertension (HT) was the most common CV CM (STRIDE, 212 [54%]; D, 163 [42%]; S, 197 [51%]), and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) was the most common MB CM (STRIDE, 141 [36%]; D, 104 [27%]; S, 110 [28%]). In the STRIDE arm, OS HRs (95% CI) in pts with vs without CMs were 0.86 (0.68–1.08) for CV CMs and 1.16 (0.92–1.47) for MB CMs (Table). 36- and 48-mo OS rates were higher with STRIDE vs S in pts with CMs (Table). Higher proportions of pts with CMs were LTS with STRIDE vs S (Table). For STRIDE, rates of serious treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were similar in pts with CMs (21%) and all pts in the SAS (18%). [Formula presented] Conclusions: Pts with CMs experienced similar OS benefits from STRIDE as those without CMs, and long-term survival was achieved in more pts with STRIDE than S, irrespective of CM presence. No new safety signals were observed. Findings continue to support the unprecedented long-term benefits of STRIDE in a broad population reflective of uHCC globally.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","35",,"S158",,"1 Jun 2024","Background: Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a heterogeneous group of malignancies and typically diagnosed at advanced stages for which curative surgery is not feasible and prognosis is poor. Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (gem/cis) is first-line standard of care for advanced BTC (aBTC) for over a decade. Adding durvalumab to gem/cis significantly improved OS compared with gem/cis alone without increase the rate of TRAEs and discontinuation rate due to adverse events (TOPAZ-1 study). In China, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy other than gem/cis are also commonly used in clinical practice. While the effect of durvalumab in combination with other gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimens and patients with ECOG PS 2 for aBTC is unknown. At the same time, this study will provide an overview of genetic alterations in Chinese BTC patients and indicates the potential biomarkers that may correlate with study treatment. Trial design: TopDouble is a multicenter, phase IIIb, single arm study evaluating the safety and efficacy of durvalumab in combination with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment for Chinese patients with aBTC. Approximately 115 patients with previous untreated, locally advanced or metastatic BTC will be enrolled. Key eligibility criteria include age ≥18 years; ECOG PS of 0 - 2; histologically confirmed BTC. All patients will be treated by durvalumab in combination with an investigator selected gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Gemcitabine-based chemotherapy includes gemcitabine + oxaliplatin, gemcitabine + S1, gemcitabine + cisplatin (only for ECOG PS 2 pts) according to local practice. The primary endpoint is incidence of grade 3 or 4 possibly related adverse event (PRAE) within 6 months after the initiation of durvalumab plus gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, objective response rate. Exploratory endpoint will investigate baseline gene profile of tumour tissue, to characterize the different genetic alterations of China-specific BTC, and mechanisms of resistance to treatment and identify putative biomarkers of prognosis.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","42","16",,,"1 Jun 2024","Background: Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a rare but aggressive heterogenous group of gastrointestinal cancers that arise from the intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma [CCA]) or the gallbladder (GBC). In early-stage disease following curative resection, adjuvant chemotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine- or gemcitabine-based regimen is usually recommended, however, recurrence rates remain high (e.g. in the BILCAP study, 5-year recurrence-free survival with adjuvant capecitabine was 34%). Immunotherapy is efficacious as adjuvant therapy in other cancer types. Results from the TOPAZ-1 andKEYNOTE-966 studies support combining immunotherapy and chemotherapy in advanced BTC, including in locally advanced non-metastatic disease. Furthermore, dual inhibition of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and the novel immune checkpoint, T cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domain (TIGIT), has shown promising results across multiple tumor types without major increases in high-grade toxicity compared with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibition alone. Rilvegostomig is an anti-PD-1/-TIGIT bi-specific monoclonal antibody that appears active and well tolerated in non-small-cell lung cancer. ARTEMIDE-Biliary01 will investigate the efficacy of rilvegostomig plus standard of care adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with BTC after curative intent resection. Methods: ARTEMIDE-Biliary01 (NCT06109779) is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multicenter, global study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of rilvegostomig IV every three weeks versus placebo in combination with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, S-1 [tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil] or gemcitabine/cisplatin) as adjuvant treatment in patients with BTC after curative intent resection. This study will enroll approximately 750 adults with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the biliary tract (intrahepatic or extrahepatic CCA or muscle-invasive GBC) after macroscopically complete resection (R0 or R1) and an ECOG PS of 0-1. Key exclusion criteria include locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic disease at initial diagnosis and any anti-cancer therapy for BTC prior to surgery. The primary endpoint is recurrence-free survival, and the key secondary endpoint is overall survival. Additional endpoints include progression-free survival following recurrence, patient-reported tolerability, and safety. Enrollment has begun, and approximately 200 sites will be recruiting globally across Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.",,,,L644908408,

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","42","16",,,"1 Jun 2024","Background: Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) present with advanced unresectable or metastatic disease and survival rates remain poor. While approved checkpoint inhibitor (CPI)-based combination regimens for HCC have shown improvements in overall survival (OS), not all patients respond to currently available CPI-based therapy, and new strategies to overcome CPI-resistance using novel combination therapies are urgently needed. HCC gene expression profile analysis points to TGF-β signaling as a possible mechanism of immune escape. The first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody livmoniplimab (ABBV- 151) was developed that specifically binds to the glycoprotein-A repetitions predominanttransforming growth factor (GARP-TGF)-β complex, blocking release of active TGF-β1 and promoting immunoreactivity. A phase 1 study in HCC showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 42% (5/12) when combining livmoniplimab with the programmed cell death 1 inhibitor budigalimab (ABBV-181). We describe herein a phase 2/3 study of livmoniplimab + budigalimab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HCC. Methods: This multicenter, phase 2/3, randomized, open-label study (NCT06109272) will enroll patients (≥18 years) with advanced HCC (aHCC) who have not previously received systemic treatment and have Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C, not eligible for locoregional therapy, Child-Pugh class A or B7, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1. The study will have 2 stages. Stage 1 is a phase 2 dose-optimization lead-in, during which ∼80 patients will be enrolled and randomized 1:1:2 to receive 1 of 2 doses of livmoniplimab in combination with budigalimab Q3W, or investigator's choice of either atezolizumab + bevacizumab Q3W or single-dose tremelimumab + durvalumab Q4W per STRIDE regimen. The primary objective of stage 1 is to select the optimal livmoniplimab dose to use in combination with budigalimab. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic data will be combined with prior phase 1/ 2 study data to select the livmoniplimab dose for stage 2. Stage 2 is a phase 3 study in ∼580 patients with aHCC. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive the optimized dose of livmoniplimab + budigalimab or single-dose tremelimumab (300 mg) + durvalumab (1500 mg) Q4W (STRIDE). The primary objective for stage 2 is to evaluate the efficacy of livmoniplimab + budigalimab as measured by median OS. Secondary objectives include assessment of safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and PK, efficacy measured by median progression-free survival, ORR, and duration of response as well as the impact on patient-reported outcomes.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","42","16",,,"1 Jun 2024","Background: Patients (pts) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often present with unresectable advanced/metastatic disease and have a poor prognosis. Gene expression profiles of HCC tumors suggest transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling as a possible mechanism of immune escape. First-in-class monoclonal antibody (mAb) livmoniplimab (livmo; ABBV-151) targets the GARP-TGF-β1 complex and prevents release of active TGF-β1. Budigalimab (budi) is an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) mAb. Promising clinical activity was seen with livmo + budi in a phase 1 study (NCT03821935); overall response rate=42% (5/12; n=4 per RECIST v1.1, n=5 per iRECIST) in pts with advanced HCC that progressed on/after a first-line (1L) systemic therapy not including a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. Approved ICI combinations have low response rates of ∼20-30% in pts with 1L HCC; most will eventually experience relapse and require additional treatment options. This phase 2 trial will investigate dosing, safety, and efficacy of livmo + budi in pts with locally advanced/metastatic HCC that progressed after a 1L ICI-containing regimen. Methods: This open-label, randomized study (EU CT: 2022-502948- 13-00) will enroll pts ≥18 years with locally advanced/metastatic HCC, evaluable or measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, Child-Pugh A, ECOG PS ≤1, who experienced failure of an ICIcontaining regimen in 1L HCC and completed a ≥28-day washout period for prior systemic treatment. Pts with active/untreated central nervous system metastases will be excluded. Primary objectives include identifying the optimal livmo dose in combination with budi and determining the recommended phase 3 dose (RP3D), and evaluating efficacy (best overall response rate) of livmo + budi. Secondary and exploratory objectives are to evaluate efficacy (duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival), safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), predictive biomarkers, and ptreported symptoms and tolerability. Pts (n=120) will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive 400mg sorafenib BID/8-12mg lenvatinib QD orally (control; investigator choice), low- or high-dose IV livmo (selected based on mode of action, clinical efficacy and safety, and clinical PK/PD modeling) + IV budi Q3W in 21-day cycles. Pts will be treated until confirmed disease progression, other discontinuation criteria are met, or for 2 years (whichever comes first). A nonbinding futility interim analysis will be conducted after 60 pts (20 per cohort) are enrolled and had ≥2 tumor assessments, a primary analysis at ≥4 months after first dosing of the last enrolled pt, and the final analysis at completion of a 90-day safety follow-up after ≤2 years of study treatment. The RP3D for livmo will be selected based on all available preclinical and clinical data. Enrollment began in July 2023 and up to 60 sites in ∼7 countries will be included.",,,,L644908563,

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","42","16",,,"1 Jun 2024","Background: Intermediate-stage HCC represents a heterogeneous population, posing unique challenges for therapeutic management. With the advent of effective systemic therapies for unresectable HCC, the treatment landscape for intermediate-stage extends beyond LRT, particularly in patients with high tumor burden. The growing evidence about the benefit of systemic therapy in intermediate-stage HCC led to the inclusion in some recent guidelines of systemic therapy as the first choice of treatment in TACE-unsuitable patients with intermediate-stage HCC. Despite these recommendations, no randomized clinical trial has been published comparing LRT with TACE/TARE versus systemic therapy in patients with intermediate-stage HCC and high tumor burden. Methods: REPLACE is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial that will compare the efficacy and safety of LRT with TACE/TARE versus systemic therapy, for the first-line treatment of intermediate-stage HCC with beyond up-to-7 criteria. Eligible participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive regorafenib (90 mg orally q.d. on days 1 to 21 of a 4-week cycle), and pembrolizumab (400 mg i.v. on day 1 of a 6- week cycle) or LRT with TACE or TARE, and will be stratified according to geographic region (Asia vs. non-Asia), ECOG Performance Status (0 vs 1) and Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade (1 vs 2). Patients must have intermediate-stage HCC with beyond up-to-seven criteria (Up-to-7 criteria = largest tumor diameter (cm) + number of tumors≤7), measurable disease per RECIST 1.1, disease not amenable to curative treatment but amenable to LRT with TACE or TARE, no prior systemic or LRT for HCC, except for successful resection and/or ablation completed ≥ 6 months prior to randomization. Patients will be treated until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or other treatment discontinuation criteria is met. The primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS), assessed locally by the Investigator using mRECIST for HCC. Secondary endpoints include PFS assessed locally by the Investigator using RECIST 1.1; PFS centrally assessed using mRECIST and RECIST 1.1; overall survival; overall response rate according to RECIST v.1.1 and mRECIST based on the Investigator's and central assessment; time to unTACEable progression; duration of response; safety and tolerability of the trial treatments, and patient reported outcomes for health-related quality of life.

"Quantifying the risk of hypocalcemia in individuals treated with cabozantinib","Murthy A.","Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024) 42:16 Supplement. Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","42","16",,,"1 Jun 2024","Background: Cabozantinib, a potent inhibitor for multiple receptor-tyrosine kinases, has been approved for the treatment of various advanced cancers. The risks of all-grade and high-grade hypocalcemia have been noted in many clinical trials. We have conducted an up-to-date systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials using single agent cabozantinib to assess the overall risk of hypocalcemia. Methods: We systematically identified relevant Englishlanguage studies primarily from PubMed and Clinicaltrials.gov (up to March 2023), covering phase I to phase III trials using cabozantinib in cancer patients. Studies with patients assigned to single agent cabozantinib with available data on hypocalcemia were included. We employed fixed-effects or random-effect models depending on study heterogeneity to calculate the incidence and relative risk of hypocalcemia. Results: A total of nineteen studies were included for analysis. The overall incidence of all-grade hypocalcemia with cabozantinib was 15.0% (95% CI: 9.0-21.0%), with a high-grade (grade 3 or 4) incidence of 2.0% (95% CI: 1.0-3.0%). Significant variability was observed among different tumor types (p < 0.001), ranging from 45.0% in multiple myeloma to 2.0% in hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer. In comparison with placebo, cabozantinib significantly increased the risk of hypocalcemia with an RR of 1.75 (95% CI: 0.96-2.53, p < 0.001). However, when compared to prednisone, cabozantinib showed a non-significant risk reduction of 0.30 (95% CI: -0.20-0.79, p = 0.24). Furthermore, cabozantinib did not elevate the risk of hypocalcemia compared to other chemotherapeutic agents (everolimus, paclitaxel, and sunitinib). Conclusions: Patients undergoing cabozantinib treatment face an increased risk of hypocalcemia, with variations observed across different tumor types. Proactive measures can be implemented to prevent or mitigate hypocalcemia during cabozantinib therapy. Additionally, monitoring vulnerable patient populations is essential to optimize clinical care and enhance overall outcomes.",,,,L644910919,

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","42","16",,,"1 Jun 2024","Background: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of combining Camrelizumab (an anti-programmed death 1 antibody) and Apatinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) with intensitymodulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: This non-randomized phase 2 study enrolled patients with unresectable HCC who were either systemic treatment-naïve or refractory/intolerant to first-line targeted therapy. The enrolled patients received IMRT at a dose of 50-60 Gy in 25-30 fractions, with the target volume encompassing all visible lesions. Patients were administered Camrelizumab intravenously at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks and Apatinib orally a dose of 250 mg once daily during IMRT, continuing for 2 years or until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), while secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), local control (LC) rate, overall survival (OS) and adverse events. Results: From October 2020 to January 2024, 33 patients were included in the preliminary analysis (31 men and 2 women; median age, 57 years [range, 39-77 years]). Among them, 30 patients were diagnosed with BCLC stage C (90.9%). The median number of lesions was one (range, 1-5), with a median tumor diameter of 6.0cm(range, 2.6-16.0 cm). Tumor thrombus was observed in 22 cases (66.7%), and lymph node metastases was found in 6 cases (18.2%). The ORR based on RECIST 1.1 and modified RECIST criteria were 78.8% and 90.9%, respectively, with a complete response (CR) rate of 12.1% and 54.5%, respectively. The median follow-up time was 20.0 months (range, 3.3-38.6 months). The LC rate at 2 years was 88.3% (95% CI, 68.1- 96.1%). The median PFS was 17.5 months (95% CI, 12.6-NA), and the PFS rate at 2 years was 43.9% (95% CI, 26.1-73.8%). The median OS was 25.9 months (95% CI, 14.0-NA), and OS rate at 2 years was 58.5% (95% CI, 41.9-81.6%). According to CTCAE 5.0, grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 27 patients (81.8%), with the most common being thrombocytopenia (42.5%), leukopenia (33.3%) and hypertension (39.4%). No treatment-related deaths occurred. Conclusions: The combination of systematic therapies involving Camrelizumab and Apatinib with local-regional treatment of IMRT showed promising outcomes and manageable toxicities in patients with unresectable HCC. These findings warrant to be confirmed in phase 3 prospective studies.",,,,L644911541,

Hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) combined with apatinib and camrelizumab could augment treatment efficacy in preliminary study. But HAIC has disadvantages such as technical limitations, expensive cost, impaired liver function and poor patient comfort. Results from our previous phase II trial (NCT05412589) demonstrate that the triplet treatment of Venous Infusional FOLFOX plus camrelizumab and apatinib showed inspiring antitumor activity and acceptable safety for CNLC stage III HCC, especially in those with main portal trunk invasion (Vp4). These results encourage us to further compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous FOLFOX with apatinib and camrelizumab versus HAIC-FOLFOX with apatinib and camrelizumab as first-line treatment in advanced HCC. Methods: This multicenter, randomized, open-label, noninferiority phase 3 study (NCT06172205) will enroll 192 patients. Essential criteria for patient inclusion encompassed: age between 18 and 75 years; a clinical diagnosis conforms to primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); classification with in BCLC stage C; no prior anti-tumor treatment exposure; presence of at least one measurable tumor as per RECIST v1.1; ECOG performance status score of either 0 or 1; and a Child-Pugh A or B. Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) into two groups. Randomization is stratified by the presence of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis (yes vs no), and baseline alpha-fetoprotein concentration (<400 ng/mL vs ≥400 ng/mL). There are 2 arms in the study: (1) Arm A: FOLFOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, leucovorin 200 mg/m2,5-fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m2 on day 1, and 5-fluorouracil infusion 2400 mg/m2 for 46 hours; q3w; up to 6 cycles) intravenously in combination with apatinib (250mgpo qd) and camrelizumab (200mgiv q3w). (2) Arm B: hepatic arterial infusion FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil q3w; up to 6 cycles), combined with apatinib (250 mg po qd) and camrelizumab (200 mg iv q3w).

Secondary outcomes encompass the Objective response rate, Disease control rate, Duration of response, PFS, Overall survival (OS), along with 12-month PFS rate, 6-month and 12-month OS rates. The additional secondary endpoints include assessment of treatment-related adverse events. With the assumption of a median 6-month PFS rate of 85% in the Arm B and 71% in the Arm A (noninferiority margin, 14%), a total of 162 patients were required under a two-sided 5% significance level and 80% power.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","42","16",,,"1 Jun 2024","Background: Primary liver cancer is a major health burden globally, ranking sixth in incidence and third in mortality among all cancers[1]. Over the past 5 years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and multi-targeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitors have emerged as new treatment options for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma[2-4]. Nevertheless, only a small subset of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma derive a response to ICI monotherapy. Icaritin, a target tumor micro-environment(TME) modulating compound, which interacts with MyD88/IkB kinase-a (IKK)[5], inhibiting the TNF-a-induced IKK and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) signaling pathways and blocking PD-L1 expression in HBV-related HCC[6-9] and has been approved in China for the treatment of first-line advanced HCC. Icaritin phase III study previously reported at 2021 ASCO, we therefore investigated the efficacy of icaritin in patients with unresectable stage IIA-IIIB (CNLC stage) HCC in a real-world setting. Methods: This multi-center, retrospective study, conducted between May 2022 and Nov 2023. We retrospectively collected medical records of patients (pts) with unresectable IIA-IIIB (CNLC stage) HCC who received icaritin monotherapy (mono-group) or icaritin combined with PD-1/L1 and/or anti-VEGF therapy (combination group) as first line therapy. The primary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS); Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) rate, objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1, and safety. Results: Patients characteristics: 49 pts were eligible for inclusion with median age of 60.7 years old (range 18.0-89.0), 91.8% were ECOG PS 0-1, 86.5% had HBV infection, 79.6% were stage III and 48.9% were AFP>400 ng/ml. 33 pts administrated with combination therapy, other 16 pts' regimen was icaritin monotherapy. Efficacy: As of the data cutoff for the preliminary analysis of progression free survival (Nov 30, 2023), the median follow-up was 11.17 months (95%CI 6.74-12.12). The ORR for the combination group was 6.06%, and 12.50% for the mono-group, the mPFS was 8.94(95%CI 6.90~9.76) and 5.52 (2.92~NE) for each group. The mOS was not reached for both group, the 6 and 12-months OS rates were 91.00% and 73.67% respectively. Safety: For the safety information, most of TRAEs were grade 1 or 2. No serious AEs were observed. Conclusions: This real-world retrospective study revealed that icaritin monotherapy and icaritin-based combination therapy are promising therapeutic options for unresectable HCC in China.",,,,L644912183,

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","42","16",,,"1 Jun 2024","Background: In Phase III study (ZGDH3), donafenib showed the survival benefit and better safety compared with sorafenib as the first-line treatment for uHCC. Recently, combination therapies have shown favorable results in patients with HCC. Some studies have shown that molecular targeted drugs combined with anti-PD1 antibodies and TACE exhibit improved antitumor efficacy compared with monotherapy. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of donafenib,anti-PD-1 antibodies and TACE as first-line treatments for HCC patients in the real world. Methods: This single-center retrospective study involved patients with histopathologically/cytologically or clinically confirmed HCC at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital between July 2021 and June 2023. Eligible patients were treated with donafenib (100 mg po bid) combined with TACE and anti-PD-1 antibodies until the point of disease progression, death, or intolerable toxicity. The objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) datas of patients were collected and analyzed according to the mRECIST, and the incidence of adverse events (AEs) was evaluated using CTCAE 5.0. Results: There were 34 patients in this study (Table). The median age was 64 years (IQR: 57, 69) at the data cut-off in January 2024, with 94.1% of the population being male and 82.4% having HBV infection. Of these patients, 5(14.7%) were classed as BCLC stage A, 11(32.3%) were classed as BCLC stage B, and 18 (52.9%) were BCLC stage C. The median PFS was 7.9 months (95%CI, 5.6-NA), and median OS was not reached, respectively, the 12-month PFS and OS rates were 46.9% (95%CI: 16.8%-72.5%) and 96.9% (95%CI: 79.8%-99.6%). The ORR and DCR for all patients were 73.5% and 97.1%, respectively, based on both mRECIST (CR 3 [8.8%], PR 22 [64.7%], SD 8 [23.5%]). The surgical conversion rate was 26.5%. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) of any grade were observed by 18 patients (52.9%), of which 4 patients (11.8%) had grade 3 TRAE. No grade 4 or 5 TRAE was observed.

Date of Publication: 28 May 2024","2024",,,"JCO2301462",,"28 May 2024","PURPOSE: In the phase III HIMALAYA study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03298451) in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), the Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab (STRIDE) regimen significantly improved overall survival versus sorafenib, and durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), a secondary outcome from HIMALAYA, are reported here. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive STRIDE, durvalumab, or sorafenib. PROs were assessed (preplanned secondary outcome) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Quality of Life Questionnaire and the 18-item HCC module. Time to deterioration (TTD), change from baseline and improvement rate in global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL), functioning, and disease-related symptoms were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 1,171 participants were randomly assigned to STRIDE (n = 393), durvalumab (n = 389), or sorafenib (n = 389) and were evaluable for PRO assessments. Across treatment arms, compliance rates for PROs were >77% at baseline and >70% overall. Baseline scores were comparable across treatment arms. TTD in GHS/QoL, physical functioning, fatigue, appetite loss, and abdominal pain was numerically longer for both STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. Clinically meaningful deterioration in PROs was not observed in any treatment arm. However, TTD in nausea and abdominal swelling was numerically longer for STRIDE versus sorafenib, and the likelihood of clinically meaningful improvement in GHS/QoL, role, emotional and social functioning, and disease-related symptoms was greater with STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. PROs with STRIDE and durvalumab were generally similar. CONCLUSION: Compared with sorafenib, STRIDE and durvalumab were associated with clinically meaningful, patient-centered GHS/QoL, functioning, and symptom benefits in people with uHCC. These findings support the benefits of the STRIDE regimen compared with sorafenib for a diverse population reflective of the global uHCC population.",,,38805668,L644382356,10.1200/JCO.23.01462

Date of Publication: 18 May 2024","2024","166","5","S-1563",,"18 May 2024","Background: With the recent increase in metabolic liver diseases and viral hepatitis on antiviral agents, risk stratification biomarkers are urgently needed to identify cirrhosis patients who should be prioritized for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening for early detection. We previously developed the Prognostic Liver Secretome signature with alpha-fetoprotein (PLSec-AFP), which enables cost-effective risk-stratified HCC screening in patients with cirrhosis. Methods: PLSec-AFP was further integrated with a clinical variable-based score (aMAP score) to define PAaM, which outperformed each score alone for HCC risk stratification. PAaM was validated in two phase 3 biomarker studies using the prospective statewide Texas HCC Consortium (THCCC) and nationwide NCI EDRN HCC Early Detection Strategy (HEDS) cohorts of cirrhosis patients undergoing semi-annual HCC screening, following the prospective specimen collection, retrospective blinded evaluation (PRoBE) design. The associations between baseline PAaM and incident HCC were assessed by Fine-Gray regression, with death and liver transplantation as competing events. Results: Of 2,156 evaluable patients with cirrhosis in THCCC, 155 patients developed HCC during a median followup of 2.3 (interquartile range [IQR], 1.1-4.0) years. High-risk PAaM identified 404 (19%) high-risk and 903 (42%) intermediate-risk patients in the THCCC cohort, which was associated with incident HCC with sub-distribution hazard ratios (sHR) of 7.51 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.42-12.8) and 4.20 (95% CI, 2.52-7.01) compared to low-risk patients (n = 849, 39%), respectively. Annual HCC incidence rates of high-, intermediate-, and low-risk PAaM were 5.3%, 2.7%, and 0.6%, respectively. Of 1,328 evaluable patients with cirrhosis in the HEDS cohort, 110 patients developed HCC during a median follow-up of 2.9 (IQR, 1.1-5.2) years. PAaM identified 201 (15%) high-risk and 540 (41%) intermediate-risk patients, which were associated with incident HCC with sHRs of 6.54 (95% CI, 3.85-11.1) and 1.77 (95% CI, 1.02-3.08) compared to low-risk patients (n = 587, 44%), respectively. Annual HCC incidence rates of high-, intermediate-, and low-risk PAaM were 6.2%, 1.8%, and 0.8%, respectively. In both cohorts, PAaM achieved the benchmark to enable costeffective risk-stratified HCC screening (i.e., sHR > 2) defined in our prior Markov modelbased simulation. Conclusions: In two large-scale phase 3 biomarker validation studies, PAaM was successfully validated for HCC risk stratification. In addition to identifying highrisk patients, PAaM can identify low-risk patients (approximately 40%) with HCC incidence rate below the cost-effectiveness threshold for HCC screening.",,,,L2032011100,10.1016/S0016-5085(24)04050-2

After completing DB treatment, all patients were eligible to receive open-label (OL) TAF through week 384 (year 8). Here we present the final safety results at year 8. Method: In a pooled analysis, treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), discontinuations, and laboratory abnormalities were assessed in patients who received OLTAF. Changes from baseline in estimated GFR (by Cockcroft-Gault; eGFRCG) and changes in hip and spine bone mineral density (BMD) by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were assessed. Results: Of 1298 randomized and treated patients, 1157 (89%; 775 TAF; 382 TDF) entered the OL phase. Overall, 974 (75%) participants completed OL study treatment. The overall incidence of patients experiencing AEs was similar among groups. Rates of Grade 3/ 4 AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation (D/C) were low and similar among groups. Few Grade 3/4 AEs or SAEs were related to the study drug. Overall, the most common Grade 3/4 lab abnormalities (>2%) were increased amylase (TAF 1.9%, TDF-TAF 2.7%), creatine kinase (TAF 1.4%, TDF-TAF 2.1%), fasting cholesterol (TAF 1.4%, TDF-TAF 2.9%), fasting LDL (TAF 5.9%, TDF-TAF 8.0%), and urine glucose (TAF 5.2%, TDF-TAF 2.7%). After experiencing declines in eGFRCG and hip/spine BMD with TDF treatment in the DB phase, renal and bone outcomes improved following the switch to OL TAF with minimal change through year 8. Overall, low rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were observed over 8 years, with 11 cases occurring in the DB and 10 in the OL phases of the study.

Date of Publication: 1 May 2024","2024","31","5","465","474","1 May 2024","Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) are often used for treatment of several types of cancer; however, they are associated with an increased risk of proteinuria, sometimes leading to treatment discontinuation. We searched PubMed and Scopus to identify clinical studies examining the incidence and risk factors for proteinuria caused by VEGFR-TKIs in patients with renal cell carcinoma, thyroid cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The global incidence of proteinuria ranged from 6% to 34% for all grades of proteinuria, and from 1% to 10% for grade ≥3 proteinuria. The incidence of proteinuria did not differ significantly by cancer type, but in all three cancer types, there was a trend toward a higher incidence of proteinuria with lenvatinib than with other VEGFR-TKIs. In terms of risk factors, the incidence of proteinuria was significantly higher among Asians (including Japanese) compared with non-Asian populations. Other risk factors included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and previous nephrectomy. When grade 3/4 proteinuria occurs, patients should be treated according to the criteria for dose reduction or withdrawal specified for each drug. For grade 2 proteinuria, treatment should be continued when the benefits outweigh the risks. Referral to a nephrologist should be considered for symptoms related to decreased renal function or when proteinuria has not improved after medication withdrawal. These management practices should be implemented universally, regardless of the cancer type.",,,38318663,L2028460905,10.1111/iju.15409

Results reported herein are from a 4-year updated OS analysis of HIMALAYA. Patients and methods: Participants with uHCC and no previous systemic treatment were randomized to STRIDE (n = 393), durvalumab (n = 389), or sorafenib (n = 389). The updated data cut-off was 23 January 2023. OS and serious adverse events (AEs) were assessed. Additionally, baseline characteristics and subsequent therapies were analyzed in long-term survivors (≥36 months beyond randomization). Results: For STRIDE, durvalumab, and sorafenib, median [95% confidence interval (CI)] follow-up was 49.12 months (46.95-50.17 months), 48.46 months (46.82-49.81 months), and 47.31 months (45.08-49.15 months), respectively. OS hazard ratio (95% CI) for STRIDE versus sorafenib was 0.78 (0.67-0.92). The 36-month OS rate for STRIDE was 30.7% versus 19.8% for sorafenib. The 48-month OS rate remained higher for STRIDE at 25.2%, versus 15.1% for sorafenib. The long-term OS benefit of STRIDE was observed across clinically relevant subgroups and was further improved in participants who achieved disease control. Long-term survivors with STRIDE (n = 103) included participants across clinically relevant subgroups, and 57.3% (59/103) had no reported subsequent anticancer therapy. No new serious treatment-related AEs occurred with STRIDE from the primary analysis (17.5%; 68/388). Durvalumab maintained OS noninferiority to sorafenib and no late-onset safety signals were identified. Conclusions: These data represent the longest follow-up to date in phase III studies in uHCC. The unprecedented 3- and 4-year OS rates reinforce the sustained long-term OS benefit of STRIDE versus sorafenib. STRIDE maintained a tolerable yet differentiated safety profile from other current uHCC therapies. Results continue to support the long-term benefits of STRIDE in a diverse population, reflective of uHCC globally.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03298451)",,38382875,L2031044861,10.1016/j.annonc.2024.02.005

It is the only modality shown to have completed all five phases of validation and can achieve high sensitivity and specificity for HCC detection, especially when conducted by expert sonographers in high-volume centers. However, US also has limitations, including operator dependency and varying sensitivity in clinical practice. Further, the sensitivity of US for early-stage HCC detection is lower in patients with obesity or nonviral liver disease, increasingly common populations undergoing surveillance. Imaging-based and blood-based surveillance strategies, including abbreviated MRI and biomarker panels, may overcome some limitations of US-based surveillance. Both strategies have promising test performance in phase II and phase III biomarker studies and are undergoing prospective validation. Considering the variation in HCC risk and test performance between patients, there will likely be a shift away from a one-size-fits-all approach and toward precision screening, in which the “best” test is selected based on individual patient characteristics. In this upcoming era of precision HCC screening among patients with cirrhosis, US will likely continue to have an important, albeit reduced, surveillance role.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02514434, NCT02551250, NCT06084234)",,38742973,L2032522959,10.1148/radiol.232624

Methods: Patients from REFLECT who received lenvatinib (n = 476) were stratified according to CSTE-HTN. Tumors were assessed by mRECIST. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated using landmark analyses at 4 and 8 weeks. Results: A total of 212 patients in the lenvatinib arm developed CSTE-HTN, and 264 did not. CSTE-HTN first occurred at 3.7 weeks (median); the worst grade CSTE-HTN occurred at 4.1 weeks (median). No patients had life-threatening CSTE-HTN and/or died due to CSTE-HTN. Median OS was numerically longer in patients with versus without CSTE-HTN (at 4 weeks: 16.3 vs. 11.6 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.621–1.004; at 8 weeks: 13.5 vs. 11.6 months; HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.696–1.089). Median PFS was similar between patients with and without CSTE-HTN (at 4 weeks: 6.6 vs. 6.4 months; HR, 0.887; 95% CI, 0.680–1.157; at 8 weeks: 5.7 vs. 6.4 months; HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.84–1.41). Objective response rate was numerically higher in patients with (48.6%) versus without CSTE-HTN (34.5%). Conclusions: In this retrospective analysis, CSTE-HTN was associated with improved OS but not PFS. CSTE-HTN did not impair the outcomes of patients with HCC treated with lenvatinib when detected early and managed appropriately.",,,38261521,L2028015827,10.1002/cncr.35185

This review summarizes the nonclinical studies and clinical development that supported regulatory clearance. Similar to other gene therapies for single gene disorders, both the short-term safety and the phenotypic improvement were unequivocal, justifying the modest-sized safety and efficacy database, which included 57 participants across the phase 2b (3 participants) and phase 3 (54 participants) studies. The most common adverse reactions included liver enzyme elevation, headache, flu-like symptoms, infusion-related reactions, creatine kinase elevation, malaise, and fatigue; these were mostly transient. One participant had hepatocellular carcinoma on a study-mandated liver ultrasound conducted 1 year after vector infusion; molecular analysis of the resected tumor showed no evidence of vectorrelated insertional mutagenesis as the etiology. A remarkable 96% of participants in the phase 3 trial were able to stop factor IX (FIX) prophylaxis, with the study demonstrating noninferiority to FIX prophylaxis in terms of the primary end point, annualized bleeding rate. Key secondary end points such as the annualized infusion rate, which declined by 97%, and the plasma FIX activity level at 18 months after infusion, with least squares mean increase of 34.3 percentage points compared with baseline, were both clinically and statistically significant. The FDA's landmark approval of Hemgenix as a pioneering treatment for hemophilia stands on the shoulders of >20 years of gene therapy clinical research and heralds a promising future for genomic medicines.",,,38592711,L2031560495,10.1182/bloodadvances.2023010511

This trial aimed to test the efficacy of an integrated screening and novel stepped collaborative care intervention versus standard of care for patients with cancer and at least one of the following symptoms: depression, pain, or fatigue. Methods: This randomised, parallel, phase 3 trial was conducted in 29 oncology outpatient clinics associated with the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center in the USA. Patients (aged ≥21 years) with any cancer type and clinical levels of depression, pain, or fatigue (or all of these) were eligible. Eligible family caregivers were aged 21 years or older and providing care to a patient diagnosed with cancer who consented for this study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to stepped collaborative care or standard of care using a central, permuted block design (sizes of 2, 4, and 6) stratified by sex and prognostic status. The biostatistician, oncologists, and outcome assessors were masked to treatment assignment. Stepped collaborative care was once-weekly cognitive behavioural therapy for 50–60 min from a care coordinator via telemedicine (eg, telephone or videoconferencing). Pharmacotherapy for symptoms might be initiated or changed if recommended by the treatment team or preferred by the patient. Standard of care was screening and referral to a health-care provider for treatment of symptoms. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life in patients at 6 months. Maintenance of the treatment benefits was assessed at 12 months. Participants included in the primary analysis were per intention to treat, which included patients missing one or both follow-up assessments. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02939755). Findings: Between Dec 5, 2016, and April 8, 2021, 459 patients and 190 family caregivers were enrolled. 222 patients were assigned to standard of care and 237 to stepped collaborative care. Of 459 patients, 201 (44%) were male and 258 (56%) were female. Patients in the stepped collaborative care group had a greater 0–6-month improvement in health-related quality of life than patients in the standard-of-care group (p=0·013, effect size 0·09). Health-related quality of life was maintained for the stepped collaborative care group (p=0·74, effect size 0·01). Patients in the stepped collaborative care group had greater 0–6-month improvements than the standard-of-care group in emotional (p=0·012), functional (p=0·042), and physical (p=0·033) wellbeing. No adverse events were reported by patients in either group and deaths were considered unrelated to the study. Interpretation: An integrated screening and novel stepped collaborative care intervention, compared with the current standard of care, is recommended to improve health-related quality of life. The findings of this study will advance the implementation of guideline concordant care (screening and treatment) and has the potential to shift the practice of screening and treatment paradigm nationwide, improving outcomes for patients diagnosed with cancer.

This phase II trial was conducted to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib, sintilimab (a PD-1 inhibitor) plus TACE (Len-Sin-TACE) in patients with advanced stage HCC. Methods: This was a single-arm phase II trial. Patients with BCLC stage C HCC were recruited. They received lenvatinib (bodyweight ≥60 kg, 12 mg; bodyweight <60 kg, 8 mg) orally once daily, sintilimab (200 mg) intravenously once every 3 weeks, and on demand TACE. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) per mRECIST. Results: Thirty patients were enrolled. The primary endpoint was met with a median PFS of 8.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1–9.8) months per mRECIST, which was the same as that per RECIST 1.1. The objective response rate was 60.0% per mRECIST and 30.0% per RECIST 1.1. The disease control rate was 86.7% per mRECIST/RECIST 1.1. The median duration of response was 7.4 (95% CI: 6.6–8.2) months per mRECIST (n = 18) and 4.3 (95% CI: 4.0–4.6) months per RECIST 1.1 (n = 9). The median overall survival was 18.4 (95% CI: 14.5–22.3) months. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 28 patients (93.3%) and grade 3 TRAEs were observed in 12 patients (40.0%).

We investigated the threshold of biotherapeutic aggregates needed to induce immunogenic responses. Methods and Results: Highly aggregated samples were tested in cell-based assays and induced cellular responses in a manner that depended on the number of particles. The threshold of immune activation varied by disease state (cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, allergy), concomitant therapies, and particle number. Compared to healthy donors, disease state patients showed an equal or lower response at the late phase (7 days), suggesting they may not have a higher risk of responding to aggregates. Xeno-het mice were used to assess the threshold of immune activation in vivo. Although highly aggregated samples (~ 1,600,000 particles/mL) induced a weak and transient immunogenic response in mice, a 100-fold dilution of this sample (~ 16,000 particles/mL) did not induce immunogenicity. To confirm this result, subvisible particles (up to ~ 18,000 particles/mL, containing aggregates and silicone oil droplets) produced under representative administration practices (created upon infusion of a drug product through an IV catheter) did not induce a response in cell-based assays or appear to increase the rate of adverse events or immunogenicity during phase 3 clinical trials. Conclusion: The ability of biotherapeutic aggregates to elicit an immune response in vitro, in vivo, and in the clinic depends on high numbers of particles. This suggests that there is a high threshold for aggregates to induce an immunogenic response which is well beyond that seen in standard biotherapeutic drug products.",,,38519817,L2029092441,10.1007/s11095-024-03678-2

For HCC, chemotherapy shows limited effect. The gold standard for HCC treatment includes curative surgical resection or liver transplantation. However, the recurrence rate at 5 years after liver resection is estimated at approximately 70% and even at 5 years after liver transplantation, it is 20%. Therefore, improving survival outcomes after curative surgical resection of liver cancer is crucial. This review highlights the importance of identifying risk factors for HCC recurrence following radical surgical resection and adjuvant therapy options that may reduce the recurrence risk and improve overall survival, including local adjuvant therapy (e.g., transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and radiotherapy), adjuvant systemic therapy (e.g., small molecule targeted therapy and immunotherapy), and other adjuvant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy).

Date of Publication: 1 Apr 2024","2024","13","4",,,"1 Apr 2024","Infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is highly prevalent globally. Over 250 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B, and more than 800,000 patients die each year due to hepatitis B complications, including liver cancer. Although protective HBV vaccines are recommended for all newborns, global coverage is suboptimal. In adults, sexual transmission is by far the most frequent route of contagion. The WHO estimates that 1.5 million new HBV infections occur annually. Oral nucleos(t)ide analogues entecavir and tenofovir are the most frequent antivirals prescribed as HBV therapy. Almost all patients adherent to the medication achieve undetectable plasma viremia beyond 6 months of monotherapy. However, less than 5% achieve anti-HBs seroconversion, and viral rebound occurs following drug discontinuation. Therefore, nucleos(t)ide analogues need to be lifelong. New long-acting formulations of tenofovir and entecavir are being developed that will maximize treatment benefit and overcome adherence barriers. Furthermore, new antiviral agents are in development, including entry inhibitors, capside assembly modulators, and RNA interference molecules. The use of combination therapy pursues a functional HBV cure, meaning it is negative for both circulating HBV-DNA and HBsAg. Even when this goal is achieved, the cccDNA reservoir within infected hepatocytes remains a signal of past infection, and HBV can reactivate under immune suppression. Therefore, new gene therapies, including gene editing, are eagerly being pursued to silence or definitively disrupt HBV genomes within infected hepatocytes and, in this way, ultimately cure hepatitis B. At this time, three actions can be taken to push HBV eradication globally: (1) expand universal newborn HBV vaccination; (2) perform once-in-life testing of all adults to identify susceptible HBV persons that could be vaccinated (or re-vaccinated) and unveil asymptomatic carriers that could benefit from treatment; and (3) provide earlier antiviral therapy to chronic HBV carriers, as being aviremic reduces the risk of both clinical progression and transmission.",,,,L2029635573,10.3390/pathogens13040291

In the initial analysis, cabozantinib plus atezolizumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival versus sorafenib. Here, we report the pre-planned final overall survival analysis and updated safety and efficacy results following longer follow-up. Methods: COSMIC-312 was an open-label, randomised, phase 3 study done across 178 centres in 32 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma were eligible. Patients must have had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), and adequate marrow and organ function, including Child–Pugh class A liver function; those with fibrolamellar carcinoma, sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma, or combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma were ineligible. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1:1) using a web-based interactive response system to a combination of oral cabozantinib 40 mg once daily plus intravenous atezolizumab 1200 mg every 3 weeks, oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily, or oral single-agent cabozantinib 60 mg once daily. Randomisation was stratified by disease aetiology, geographical region, and presence of extrahepatic disease or macrovascular invasion. Dual primary endpoints were for cabozantinib plus atezolizumab versus sorafenib: progression-free survival per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by a blinded independent radiology committee, in the first 372 randomly assigned patients (previously reported) and overall survival in all patients randomly assigned to cabozantinib plus atezolizumab or sorafenib. The secondary endpoint was progression-free survival in all patients randomly assigned to cabozantinib versus sorafenib. Outcomes in all randomly assigned patients, including final overall survival, are presented. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03755791. Findings: Between Dec 7, 2018, and Aug 27, 2020, 432 patients were randomly assigned to combination treatment, 217 to sorafenib, and 188 to single-agent cabozantinib, and included in all efficacy analyses. 704 (84%) patients were male and 133 (16%) were female. 824 of these patients received at least one dose of study treatment and were included in the safety population. Median follow-up was 22·1 months (IQR 19·3–24·8). Median overall survival was 16·5 months (96% CI 14·5–18·7) for the combination treatment group and 15·5 months (12·2–20·0) for the sorafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·98 [0·78–1·24]; stratified log-rank p=0·87). Median progression-free survival was 6·9 months (99% CI 5·7–8·2) for the combination treatment group, 4·3 months (2·9–6·1) for the sorafenib group, and 5·8 months (99% CI 5·4–8·2) for the single-agent cabozantinib group (HR 0·74 [0·56–0·97] for combination treatment vs sorafenib; HR 0·78 [99% CI 0·56–1·09], p=0·05, for single-agent cabozantinib vs sorafenib). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 281 (66%) of 429 patients in the combination treatment group, 100 (48%) of 207 patients in the sorafenib group, and 108 (57%) of 188 patients in the single-agent cabozantinib group; the most common were hypertension (37 [9%] vs 17 [8%] vs 23 [12%]), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (36 [8%] vs 18 [9%] vs 16 [9%]), aspartate aminotransferase increased (42 [10%] vs eight [4%] vs 17 [9%]), and alanine aminotransferase increased (40 [9%] vs six [3%] vs 13 [7%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 223 (52%) patients in the combination treatment group, 84 (41%) patients in the sorafenib group, and 87 (46%) patients in the single agent cabozantinib group.

Moreover, data about the full spectrum of the natural history of MASLD patients with F2 or F3 fibrosis are scarce and fragmentary. We simulated the transition probabilities of disease progression in MASLD patients with F2 or F3 fibrosis, and the effect of Resmetirom treatment on clinical outcomes. Material and methods: Data from 40 studies and individual sources on MASLD subjects formed transition matrices for fibrosis stages and complications, defined as cirrhosis development (CD), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver decompensation (LD). Markov models were developed to depict the F2 and F3 fibrosis stage progression towards the complications and to evaluate the effect of 52-week Resmetirom treatment on the natural history. Results: We estimated the five-year and lifetime probability of untreated or Resmetirom-treated MASLD patients with baseline F2 fibrosis of developing cirrhosis (11% and 39.5% in untreated; 8.8% and 37.2% in treated), LD (0.9% and 11.9% in untreated; 0.7% and 11% in treated), and HCC (0.8% and 7.2% in untreated; 0.5% and 6.8% in treated).

The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), whereas the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety. Result: After PSM, a total of 60 patients were enrolled with 30 in the P-L-G group and 30 in the P-L-H group. The median PFS was significantly longer with P-L-G group (13.7 versus 6.0 months, p < 0.0001) than with the P-L-H group. The median OS was 23.8 months in the P-L-G group versus 11.6 months in the P-L-H group (p < 0.0001). Patients in the P-L-G group exhibited a better ORR (73.3 % vs 30 %, p = 0.002) compared to the P-L-H group. The DCR was the same in both groups, 96.7 %, respectively. The P-L-G group had a higher incidence of grade 3–4 AEs than the P-L-H group. However, there was no significant difference in the any grade or grade 3–4 of AEs between the two groups. Conclusion: PD-1 inhibitor plus lenvatinib and Gemox are promising first-line regimens for the treatment of advanced BTC in the multicenter retrospective real-world study.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03892577, NCT04217954, NCT05290116, NCT05400902)",,38325044,L2030241535,10.1016/j.intimp.2024.111642

Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 80802 (Alliance) randomized phase III trial of doxorubicin plus sorafenib versus sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), showed no improvement in median overall survival (OS). Whether HCV viral load impacts therapy and whether any correlation between HCV titers and outcome based on HCV was studied. In patients with HCV, HCV titer levels were evaluated at baseline and at multiple postbaseline timepoints until disease progression or treatment discontinuation. HCV titer levels were evaluated in relation to OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Among 53 patients with baseline HCV data, 12 patients had undetectable HCV (HCV-UN). Postbaseline HCV titer levels did not significantly differ between treatment arms. One patient in each arm went from detectable to HCV-UN with greater than 2 log-fold titer levels reduction. Aside from these 2 HCV-UN patients, HCV titers remained stable on treatment. Patients who had HCV-UN at baseline were 3.5 times more likely to progress and/or die from HCC compared with HCV detectable (HR = 3.51; 95% confidence interval: 1.58-7.78; P = 0.002). HCV titer levels remained unchanged, negating any sorafenib impact onto HCV titer levels. Although an overall negative phase III study, patients treated with doxorubicin plus sorafenib and sorafenib only, on CALGB 80802 had worse PFS if HCV-UN. Higher levels of HCV titers at baseline were associated with significantly improved PFS. SIGNIFICANCE: Sorafenib therapy for HCC may impact HCV replication and viral gene expression. In HCV-positive patients accrued to CLAGB 80802 phase III study evaluating the addition of doxorubicin to sorafenib, HCV titer levels were evaluated at baseline and different timepoints.

As organelles that store and release excess lipids, lipid droplets (LDs) resemble “gears” and facilitate cancer development in the body. Aim: This review discusses the life cycle of LDs, the relationship between abnormal LDs and cancer hallmarks, and the application of LDs in theragnostic and clinical contexts to provide a contemporary understanding of the role of LDs in cancer. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and SPORTDiscus. Retrieve and summarize clinical trials of drugs that target proteins associated with LD formation using the Clinical Trials website. Create a schematic diagram of lipid droplets in the tumor microenvironment using Adobe Illustrator. Conclusion: As one of the top ten hallmarks of cancer, abnormal lipid metabolism caused by excessive generation of LDs interrelates with other hallmarks. The crosstalk between excessive LDs and intracellular free fatty acids (FFAs) promotes an inflammatory environment that supports tumor growth. Moreover, LDs contribute to cancer metastasis and cell death resistance in vivo.

This study aimed to assess its cost effectiveness from the perspective of Chinese health care system. Methods: A Markov state-transition model was developed based on the Phase 3 randomized CARES-310 clinical trial data. Health state utility values were obtained from the CARES-310 clinical trial, and direct medical costs were derived from the relevant literature and local charges. The measured outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the uncertainty of the model. Results: In the base-case analysis, the incremental effectiveness and cost of camrelizumab plus rivoceranib versus sorafenib were 0.41 QALYs and $13,684.84, respectively, resulting in an ICER of $33,619.98/QALY, lower than the willingness-to-pay threshold of China ($35,864.61/QALY).

This review combs the effects of oxidative stress on tumorigenesis on each phase and cell fate determination, and three features are discussed. Oxidative stress takes part in the processes ranging from tumorigenesis to tumor death via series pathways and processes like mitochondrial stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and ferroptosis. It can affect cell fate by engaging in the complex relationships between senescence, death, and cancer. The influence of oxidative stress on tumorigenesis and progression is a multi-stage interlaced process that includes two aspects of promotion and inhibition, with mitochondria as the core of regulation.

A personalized therapeutic cancer vaccine (PTCV) tailored against neoantigens identified in an individual's tumor may enhance responses to PD-1 inhibitors through the induction of tumor-specific immunity. Here, we present results from a single-arm Phase Ib/2a trial evaluating a DNA plasmid (GNOS-PV02) encoding up to 40 neoantigens co-administered with plasmid-encoded IL-12 (pIL12) in combination with pembrolizumab (PEMBRO) in patients (pts) with advanced HCC.Methods: Pts were eligible for study therapy upon progression or intolerance with a 1L tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The PTCV [GNOS-PV02 (1mg) and pIL12 (0.34mg)] was administered intradermally via in vivo electroporation Q3w x 4 doses, and Q9w thereafter. PEMBRO was administered at 200mg IV Q3w. The primary endpoints were safety and immunogenicity. To evaluate the secondary endpoint of ORR per RECIST 1.1 by investigator review with a null hypothesis of an ORR of 16.9% (KN-240, Finn et al ASCO 2019), 36 pts were included to provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis at the one-sided 0.10 level, assuming the true ORR rate of 33.1%. The data cut date was August 18, 2023.Results: Among the 36 enrolled pts who received at least one dose of treatment, there were no DLTs or treatment-related grade ≥3 events. The most common treatment-related adverse events were injection site reactions, observed in 41.6% of pts. ORR (mITT) per RECIST 1.1 was 30.6% (11/36; 9 confirmed and 2 unconfirmed) with 8.3% (3/36) of pts achieving a CR. This achieved statistical significance with a one-sided p-value = 0.031 (1-sided 90% CI 20.4%-100%) The mOS was 19.9 months. ctDNA changes correlated with radiographic responses and preceded them. A complete molecular response (100% ctDNA clearance) was detected in 7 pts including the 3 radiographic CRs, and 4 additional pts who continue to show durable tumor control (3PR, 1 SD). Immunological analyses confirmed the induction of neoantigen-specific T cell responses by IFNγ-ELISpot in 19/22 (86.4%) evaluable pts, and pts with a larger ELISpot response showed a trend towards longer OS. Multi-parametric cellular profiling and single-cell analysis revealed active, proliferative, and cytolytic vaccine-specific CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells in the blood of immunized pts. In 14/14 (100%) of pts with paired pre-and ontreatment blood and tumor biopsies, we identified by TCRβ bulk sequencing expanded T cell clones in the peripheral blood that also trafficked into the tumor. Conclusions: Our results show that a PTCV plus PEMBRO is well tolerated and has clinical activity in pts with advanced HCC, and support the PTCV mechanism of action based on the induction of anti-tumor T cells in peripheral blood and tumor.

This study aimed to clarify the significance of progression-free survival (PFS) or PPS of Atez/Bev treatment for HCC. Methods: We analyzed the correlations of PFS and PPS with overall survival (OS) in studies of HCC patients treated with Atez/Bev and evaluated the contribution to OS in Atez/Bev treatment with patients at our institutions as clinical practice. Results: Analysis of 18 studies involving 3,752 patients treated with Atez/Bev found that PPS had a stronger correlation with OS (R(2) = 0.872, p < 0.001) than did PFS (R(2) = 0.605, p = 0.001). Analysis of 80 patients with unresectable HCC treated with Atez/Bev found that presence of antitumor responses during Atez/Bev was the most significant contributor to OS, and post-progression treatment after Atez/Bev also significantly contribute to OS.

Moreover, data about the full spectrum of the natural history of MASLD patients with F2 or F3 fibrosis are scarce and fragmentary. We simulated the transition probabilities of disease progression in MASLD patients with F2 or F3 fibrosis, and the effect of Resmetirom treatment on clinical outcomes. Methods: Data from 40 studies and individual sources on MASLD subjects formed transition matrices for fibrosis stages and complications, defined as cirrhosis development (CD), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver decompensation (LD). Markov models were developed to depict the F2 and F3 fibrosis stage progression towards the complications and to evaluate the effect of 52-week Resmetirom treatment on the natural history. Results: We estimated the 5-year and lifetime probability of untreated or Resmetirom-treated MASLD patients with baseline F2 fibrosis of developing cirrhosis (11% and 39.5% in untreated; 8.8% and 37.2% in treated), LD (0.9% and 11.9% in untreated; 0.7% and 11% in treated), and HCC (0.8% and 7.2% in untreated; 0.5% and 6.8% in treated). Similarly, we estimated the 5-year and lifetime probability of untreated or resmetirom-treated MASLD patients with baseline F3 fibrosis of developing cirrhosis (27.7% and 52.6% in untreated; 22.9% and 48.7% in treated), LD (2.8% and 17.3% in untreated; 2.2% and 15.6% in treated), and HCC (2.8% and 10.4% in untreated; 2.1% and 9.8% in treated).

Methods: This exploratory analysis assessed STRIDE, D and S in pts with HBV (presence of HBsAg and/or anti-HBcAb with detectable HBV DNA), HCV or nonviral/other (NV) aetiology. OS HR were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model. As subsets were not sized for formal comparisons, no multiplicity adjustments were made. A post hoc multivariate analysis was used to identify chance imbalances in key prognostic factors that may bias estimated treatment effects. Result: Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar across treatment arms in the HBV and NV subsets. In the HCV group, multivariate analysis identified imbalances in two prognostic variables: extrahepatic spread (EHS; more frequent for STRIDE than S) and ALBI (score ≥2 more frequent for STRIDE and D than S). OS and PFS were improved with STRIDE vs S in the HBV and NV groups, but not in the HCV group. Using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model to account for imbalances in EHS and ALBI in the HCV subset, OS HRs favoured STRIDE vs S. OS HRs favoured STRIDE when adjusting for EHS and ALBI in the other subgroups and in aetiological subgroups. Results for D vs S showed similar trends. Conclusion: In HIMALAYA, OS favoured STRIDE vs S across aetiological subgroups when subsets were adjusted for prognostic factor imbalances in the HCV cohort; similar trends were observed with D vs S across subsets.

NEJM Evid 2022). Here, we report the 4-year OS update. Method: Pts with uHCC and no previous systemic treatment were randomised to STRIDE (T 300 mg single dose, D 1500 mg Q4W), D mono (1500 mg Q4W) or S (400 mg bid). Primary EP was OS for STRIDE vs S (DCO for this analysis: 23-Jan 2023, 78% OS data maturity for STRIDE). OS and sTRAEs were assessed. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were assessed in LTS (pts surviving ≥36 mo). Results: 1171 pts were randomised to STRIDE (n=393), D (n=389) or S (n=389); median (95% CI) duration of follow-up for OS analysis was 49.12 (46.95-50.17), 48.46 (46.82-49.81) and 47.31 (45.08-49.15) mo. The OS HR (95% CI) for STRIDE vs S was 0.78 (0.67-0.92) and OS rates at 36 mo were for STRIDE 30.7% and for S 19.8%, which is consistent with primary results.

D mono maintained non inferiority to S. Baseline demographics, clinical characteristics and subsequent therapies, incl. pts rechallenged with T among the LTS group in the STRIDE arm were consistent with FAS, suggesting that LTS benefit was not driven by any particular subgroup. Conclusions: This updated analysis shows the sustained, long-term OS benefit of STRIDE vs S with unprecedented 3- and 4-year OS rates and the longest follow-up to date in phase 3 studies in uHCC. The STRIDE regimen maintained a tolerable yet differentiated safety profile from other uHCC therapies.

The HOPE-B pivotal phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03569891) demonstrated superior bleed protection compared to FIX prophylaxis up to 24 months post treatment with ongoing follow-up from Year 2 onward. Here, we report efficacy and safety during Years 1-3. Method In this pivotal phase 3 open-label, single-arm trial, adult male patients (pts) with severe or moderately severe haemophilia B, with or without preexisting adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) neutralising antibodies, received a single dose of etranacogene dezaparvovec (2 × 1013 gc/kg, an AAV5 vector containing factor IX [FIX] Padua R338L transgene under the control of the liver-specific LP-1 promoter) following ≥ 6-month lead-in period of FIX prophylaxis. Of 54 pts receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec, 52 completed 36 months' follow-up. Mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) for all bleeds during Months 7-36 was reduced by 64 % versus lead-in (1.52 and 4.17, respectively; P = 0.0004). Mean ± SD endogenous FIX activity was sustained at 41.5 IU/ dL ± 21.7 (n = 50), 36.7 IU/dL ± 19.0 (n = 50), and 38.6 IU/dL ± 17.8 (n = 48) at Years 1, 2, and 3 posttreatment, respectively. At 3 years posttreatment, 51 pts (94 %) remained free of continuous FIX prophylaxis; mean annualized FIX consumption decreased by 96 % versus lead-in (P < 0.0001). One pt's FIX levels eventually declined to 2-5 %; his bleeding phenotype returned, and he resumed prophylaxis per protocol at Month 30 post-treatment. Results All pts experienced at least 1 adverse event (treatment-emergent AE), with no serious AEs related to treatment (1 case of hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] and 1 death were reported before Year 2 and unrelated to treatment). A total of 38/54 (70 %) pts experienced 96 treatment-related AEs. The most common AE was increased alanine transaminase (ALT). Nine pts (16.7 %) received reactive corticosteroids for mean ± SD 81.4 ± 28.6 days. No new deaths, HCC, or late treatment-related ALT elevations were reported during Year 3.

METHODS In this phase 2-3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned patients who had mild-To-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and onset of symptoms within the past 3 days in a 1:1 ratio to receive 750 mg of simnotrelvir plus 100 mg of ritonavir or placebo twice daily for 5 days. The primary efficacy end point was the time to sustained resolution of symptoms, defined as the absence of 11 Covid-19-related symptoms for 2 consecutive days. Safety and changes in viral load were also assessed. RESULTS A total of 1208 patients were enrolled at 35 sites in China; 603 were assigned to receive simnotrelvir and 605 to receive placebo. Among patients in the modified intention-To-Treat population who received the first dose of trial drug or placebo within 72 hours after symptom onset, the time to sustained resolution of Covid-19 symptoms was significantly shorter in the simnotrelvir group than in the placebo group (180.1 hours [95% confidence interval {CI}, 162.1 to 201.6] vs. 216.0 hours [95% CI, 203.4 to 228.1]; median difference, -35.8 hours [95% CI, -60.1 to -12.4]; P = 0.006 by Peto-Prentice test).

Despite therapeutic improvements in treatment strategies over the past decades, HCC still remains one of the leading causes of person-years of life lost. Numerous studies have been conducted to assess the characteristics of HCC with the aim of predicting its prognosis and responsiveness to treatment. However, the identified biomarkers have shown limited sensitivity, and the translation of these findings into clinical practice has faced challenges. The development of sequencing techniques has facilitated the exploration of a wide range of genes, leading to the emergence of gene signatures. Although several studies assessed differentially expressed genes in normal and HCC tissues to find the unique gene signature with prognostic value, to date, no study has reviewed the task, and to the best of our knowledge, this review represents the first comprehensive analysis of relevant studies in HCC. Most gene signatures focused on immune-related genes, while others investigated genes related to metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. Even though no identical gene signatures were found, NDRG1, SPP1, BIRC5, and NR0B1 were the most extensively studied genes with prognostic value. Finally, despite challenges such as the lack of consistent patterns in gene signatures, we believe that comprehensive analysis of pertinent gene signatures will bring us a step closer to personalized medicine in HCC, where treatment strategies can be tailored to individual patients based on their unique molecular profiles.",,,38269520,L2027760620,10.1002/cbf.3913

According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, patients in BCLC-A are the most suitable for potentially curative treatments (surgery or radiofrequency ablation), whereas those in BCLC-C should be treated only with systemic treatment, as locoregional interventions are ineffective due to the tumor’s extensiveness. For patients in the BCLC-B stage, trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the reference treatment, but the role of systemic treatment has been constantly increasing. As this group of patients is extremely heterogeneous, a case-by-case therapeutic strategy instead of a one-fits-all treatment is certainly required to achieve adequate results against HCC. The decision of selecting among immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), TACE, or a combination of them depends on the patient’s tumor load, the severity of liver dysfunction, the general performance status, and the presence of concomitant extrahepatic diseases.

STRIDE is approved for the treatment of adults with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the USA and Japan and for the first-line treatment of adults with advanced or unresectable HCC in Europe. In the phase III HIMALAYA trial, STRIDE significantly improved overall survival (OS) compared with sorafenib in adults with unresectable HCC and no prior systemic therapy. A higher proportion of STRIDE versus sorafenib recipients had an objective response to treatment. The OS benefit associated with STRIDE was sustained with 4 years’ follow-up. STRIDE had a manageable safety profile that differed from that of sorafenib. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in a lower proportion of STRIDE versus sorafenib recipients. Based on the available evidence, tremelimumab used as part of the STRIDE regimen is a valuable first-line agent that expands the treatment options available to patients with advanced or unresectable HCC.",,,38236364,L2027959282,10.1007/s11523-023-01026-9

Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2024","2024","25","2",,,"1 Jan 2024","Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have several systemic treatment options. There are many known risk factors for HCC, and although some, such as hepatitis C, are now treatable, others are not. For example, metabolic dysfunction-related chronic liver disease is increasing in incidence and has no specific treatment. Underlying liver disease, drug resistance, and an increasing number of treatment options without specific biomarkers are all challenges in selecting the best treatment for each patient. Conventional chemotherapy is almost never used for advanced-stage disease, which instead is treated with immunotherapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and VEGF inhibitors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting various receptors have been or are currently undergoing clinical evaluation. Ongoing trials with three-drug regimens may be the future of advanced-stage HCC treatment. Other immune-modulatory approaches of chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells, bispecific antibodies, cytokine-induced killer cells, natural killer cells, and vaccines are in early-stage clinical trials. Targeted therapies remain limited for HCC but represent an area of potential growth. As we shift away from first-line sorafenib for advanced HCC, clinical trial control arms should comprise a standard treatment other than sorafenib, one that is a better comparator for advancing therapies.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02562963, NCT02839954, NCT03132792, NCT03198546, NCT03439891, NCT04162158, NCT04194775, NCT04344158, NCT04401800, NCT04502082, NCT04720716, NCT04770896, NCT04864054, NCT04951141, NCT05003895, NCT05028933, NCT05040438, NCT05120271, NCT05131763, NCT05171309, NCT05620706, NCT05783570, NCT05845502, NCT05926726)",,38279258,L2028104354,10.3390/ijms25021259

Date of Publication: 2024","2024","15",,,,"2024","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide and accounts for more than 90% of primary liver cancer. The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related therapies combined with angiogenesis inhibition has revolutionized the treatment of HCC in late-stage and unresectable HCC, as ICIs alone were disappointing in treating HCC. In addition to the altered immune microenvironment, abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver has been extensively characterized in various types of HCC. Stains are known for their cholesterol-lowering properties and their long history of treating hypercholesterolemia and reducing cardiovascular disease risk. Apart from ICI and other conventional therapies, statins are frequently used by advanced HCC patients with dyslipidemia, which is often marked by the abnormal accumulation of cholesterol and fatty acids in the liver. Supported by a body of preclinical and clinical studies, statins may unexpectedly enhance the efficacy of ICI therapy in HCC patients through the regulation of inflammatory responses and the immune microenvironment. This review discusses the abnormal changes in lipid metabolism in HCC, summarizes the clinical evidence and benefits of stain use in HCC, and prospects the possible mechanistic actions of statins in transforming the immune microenvironment in HCC when combined with immunotherapies. Consequently, the use of statin therapy may emerge as a novel and valuable adjuvant for immunotherapies in HCC.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01075555, NCT01357486, NCT01418729, NCT01903694, NCT03024684, NCT03275376, NCT03654053)",,,L2028596772,10.3389/fphar.2024.1324140

In addition to the existing clinical guidelines, the effectiveness of anlotinib and Aurora-A inhibitors in treating HCC has also been demonstrated. However, Anlotinib, as an anti-angiogenesis therapy, has shown significant benefits in clinical trials but is limited by its single-agent treatment and the development of drug resistance. Aurora-A inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical trials but have limited efficacy. Combination therapy may offer clear advantages over monotherapy in this context. Methods: In this study, we used HCC cell lines to investigate whether the combination of the two drugs could enhance their individual strengths and mitigate their weaknesses, thereby providing greater clinical benefits both in vitro and in vivo. Results: Our findings confirmed that the Aurora-A inhibitor alisertib and anlotinib exhibited a time-dose-dependent inhibitory effect on HCC cells. In vitro cytological experiments demonstrated that the combination of the two drugs synergistically inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, while promoting cell apoptosis. Furthermore, we identified the underlying molecular mechanism by which the combination of the Aurora-A inhibitor alisertib and anlotinib inhibited HCC through the inhibition of the NF-ĸB signaling pathway.

Date of Publication: 2024","2024","14",,,,"2024","Background: Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) is a common complication and an obstacle to treatment, with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. There is still no global consensus or standard guidelines on the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with PVTT. Increasing evidence suggests that more aggressive treatment modalities, including transarterial chemoembolization, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and various combination therapies, may improve the prognosis and prolong the survival of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) patients with PVTT. We aim to comprehensively review and compare the efficacy and safety of these advanced options for aHCC with PVTT. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed and EMBASE for phase II or III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating multimodality treatments for aHCC with PVTT. Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival were constructed to retrieve individual patient-level data to strengthen the comparison of the benefits of all multimodality treatments of interest. Each study was pooled in a fixed-effects network meta-analysis (NMA). We also conducted subgroup analyses using risk ratios extracted from each study, including viral etiology, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, macrovascular invasion or portal vein tumor thrombosis, and extrahepatic spread. Multimodality treatments were ranked using SUCRA scores. Results: We identified 15 randomized controlled trials with 16 multimodality regimens that met the inclusion criteria. Among them, 5,236 patients with OS results and 5,160 patients with PFS results were included in the analysis. The hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (HAIC-FO) showed OS and PFS benefits over all the other therapies. In terms of OS, HAIC-FO, nivolumab, and TACE+Len were superior to sorafenib, lenvatinib, and donatinib monotherapies, as well as HAIC-FO+Sor. In terms of PFS, TACE+Len showed better benefits than lenvatinib, donatinib, and tremelimumab+durvalumab. A low heterogeneity (I(2) < 50%) and consistency were observed. The SUCRA score for OS ranked HAIC-FO+sorafenib as the best treatment option among all multimodality treatments in hepatitis B, MVI, or PVTT with EHS and AFP 400 μg/L subgroups. Conclusion: HAIC-FO and HAIC-FO+sorafenib are statistically better options for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with PVTT among the multimodality treatments, and their effective and safe implementation may provide the best outcomes for HCC-PVTT patients.",,,,L2028828045,10.3389/fonc.2024.1344798

A longitudinal exposure-response model of the time course of the 4 Mayo subscores (rectal bleeding, stool frequency, physician's global assessment, and endoscopic subscore) in patients with UC receiving placebo or ritlecitinib was developed using population modeling approaches and an item response theory framework. The quantitative relationships between the 4 Mayo subscores accommodated the prediction of composite endpoints such as total Mayo score and partial Mayo score (key endpoints from phase 2b), and modified clinical remission and endoscopic remission (proposed phase 3 endpoints). Clinical trial simulations using the final model assessed the probability of candidate ritlecitinib dosing regimens (including those tested in phase 2b and alternative) and phase 3 study designs for achieving target efficacy outcomes benchmarked against an approved treatment for moderate-to-severe UC. The probabilities of achieving target modified clinical remission and endoscopic improvement outcomes at both weeks 8 and 52 for ritlecitinib 100 mg once daily was 74.8%.

Design: Systematic review and network meta-analysis Data sources and methods: PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and international conference databases have been searched from 1 January 2010 to 1 December 2023. Results: After screening, 17 phase III trials encompassing 18 treatments were included. In the whole-population network meta-analysis, the newly first-line tremelimumab plus durvalumab (Tre + Du) was found to be comparable with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Atezo + Beva) in providing the best overall survival (OS) benefit [hazard ratio (HR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93–1.92]. Concerning OS benefits, sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar (Sint + Beva), camrelizumab plus rivoceranib (Camre + Rivo), and lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (Lenva + Pemb) appear to exhibit similar effects to Tre + Du and Atezo + Beva. In the context of progression-free survival, Atezo + Beva seemed to outperform Tre + Du (HR: 0.66 CI: 0.49–0.87), while the effects are comparable to Sint + Beva, Camre + Rivo, and Lenva + Pemb. Upon comparison between Asia-Pacific and non-Asia-Pacific cohorts, as well as between hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected and non-HBV-infected populations, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based treatments seemed to exhibit heightened efficacy in the Asia-Pacific group and among individuals with HBV infection. However, combined ICI-based therapies did not show more effectiveness than molecular-targeted drugs in patients without macrovascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread. As for grades 3–5 adverse events, combined therapies showed comparable safety to sorafenib and lenvatinib. Conclusion: Compared with sorafenib and lenvatinib, combination therapies based on ICIs significantly improved the prognosis of advanced HCC and demonstrated similar safety. At the same time, the optimal treatment approach should be tailored to individual patient characteristics, such as etiology, tumor staging, and serum alpha-fetoprotein levels. With lower incidence rates of treatment-related adverse events and non-inferior efficacy compared to sorafenib, ICI monotherapies should be prioritized as a first-line treatment approach for patients who are not suitable candidates for ICI-combined therapies.

This has led to modern cancer treatment algorithms frequently calling for active interventions by multiple subspecialists at the same time. One of the areas where this can be clearly seen is the concomitant use of locoregional and systemic therapies in patients with primary or secondary cancers of the liver. These combined algorithms have gained favor over the last decade and are largely focused on the allure of the combined ability to control systemic disease while at the same time addressing refractory/resistant clonal populations. While the general concept has gained favor and is likely to only increase in popularity with the continued establishment of viable immunotherapy treatments, for many patients questions remain. Lingering concerns over the increase in toxicity when combining treatment methods, patient selection, and sequencing remain for multiple cancer patient populations. While further work remains, some of these questions have been addressed in the literature.

However, underlying molecular mechanisms leading to this benign phenotype are poorly understood. Methods: Genotype A, B and D HBeAg-negative patient isolates with precore mutation G1896A from Phase 3 were analysed in comparison with respective HBeAg-positive rescue mutant and HBeAg-positive wild-type reference genomes regarding differences in viral replication, morphogenesis, infectivity and impact on NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE)-dependent gene expression and cellular kinome. Results: In comparison with reference genomes, the patient isolates are characterized by a lower intra- and extracellular hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-amount, and HBsAg-retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. Rescue of HBeAg expression increased HBsAg-amount but not its release. Expression of the isolated genomes is associated with a higher Nrf2/ARE-dependent gene expression as compared to reference genomes independent of HBeAg expression. Kinome analyses revealed a decreased activity of receptors involved in regulation of proliferative pathways for all patient isolates compared to the reference genomes. No specific conserved mutations could be found between all genomes from Phase 3. Conclusions: HBeAg-negative genomes from Phase 3 exhibit distinct molecular characteristics leading to lower HBsAg synthesis and release, enhanced oxidative stress protection and decreased activity of key kinases, triggering an antiproliferative stage, which might contribute to the lower probability of hepatocellular carcinoma. The observed differences cannot be associated with loss of HBeAg or specific mutations common to all analysed isolates, indicating the phenotype of Phase 3 derived genomes to be the result of a multifactorial process likely reflecting a conserved natural selection process.",,,39078064,L2030789364,10.1111/liv.16048

We reviewed current evidence of PFB use in HCC care and investigated the value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound with PFB (PFB-CEUS) compared with brightness mode (B-mode) ultrasound in surveillance for HCC in high-risk patients in Hong Kong. Methods: This prospective single-centre study assessed 50 high-risk patients under HCC surveillance undergoing B-mode ultrasound and PFB-CEUS, followed by gadoxetic acid–enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3 weeks of the initial ultrasound scan. The MRI findings were considered the reference standard for the diagnosis of HCC. Detection rates of all and small (≤ 2 cm) HCCs on both modalities and the adverse event rate for each modality were evaluated. Results: The detection rate of small HCCs was 4% by B-mode ultrasound and 6% by PFB-CEUS. A total of four small HCCs were identified in our cohort.

Patients in the tislelizumab armhad lower risk of deterioration in GHS/QOL (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.49-0.94), QLQ-C30 physical functioning (HR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.32-0.63) and fatigue (HR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.36-0.61), QLQ-HCC18 symptomindex (HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.34-0.81), and HCC-specific fatigue (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.45-0.79). For pain, both arms had similar risk of deterioration (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.56-1.09). At cycles 4 and 6, patients in the tislelizumab arm maintained in EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale, whereas scores decreased for the patients in the sorafenib arm. Conclusion: Patients with 1L HCC treated with tislelizumab had favorable HRQOL outcomes compared with patients treated with sorafenib, particularly in fatigue and physical functioning. These results, along with favorable safety profile, better response rate, and OS noninferiority, support tislelizumab as a potential 1L treatment option for unresectable HCC.",,,,L2032505915,10.1159/000537966

Date of Publication: 2024","2024",,,,,"2024","Background and Aims: The original hepatocellular carcinoma early detection screening (HES) score, which combines alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) with age, alanine aminotransferase, and platelets, has better performance than AFP alone for early HCC detection. We have developed HES V2.0 by adding AFP-L3 and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin to the score and compared its performance to GALAD and ASAP scores among patients with cirrhosis. Approach and Results: We conducted a prospective-specimen collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation phase 3 biomarker cohort study in patients with cirrhosis enrolled in imaging and AFP surveillance. True-positive rate (TPR)/sensitivity and false-positive rate for any or early HCC were calculated for GALAD, ASAP, and HES V2.0 scores within 6, 12, and 24 months of HCC diagnosis. We calculated the AUROC curve and estimated TPR based on an optimal threshold at a fixed false-positive rate of 10%. We analyzed 2331 patients, of whom 125 developed HCC (71% in the early stages). For any HCC, HES V2.0 had higher TPR than GALAD overall (+7.2%), at 6 months (+3.6%), at 12 months (+7.2%), and 24 months (+13.0%) before HCC diagnosis. HES V2.0 had higher TPR than ASAP for all time points (+5.9% to +12.0%). For early HCC, HES V2.0 had higher sensitivity/TPR than GALAD overall (+6.7%), at 12 months (+6.3%), and 24 months (+14.6%) but not at 6 months (+0.0%) and higher than ASAP for all time points (+13.4% to +18.0%).

"MASH clinical trials and drugs pipeline: An impending tsunami","Noureddin M.","Hepatology (2024). Date of Publication: 2024","2024",,,,,"2024","Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, formerly known as NAFLD, has ascended to prominence as the predominant chronic liver disease in Western countries and now stands as a leading cause of liver transplantations. In the more advanced stage, metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) may lead to fibrosis, a gateway to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver failure. Despite extensive research and exploration of various drug mechanisms, the anticipation for the inaugural approved drug to materialize by 2024 is palpable, marking a significant milestone. Numerous pathways have been investigated for MASH treatment, exploring thyroid hormone receptors, glucagon-like peptides 1, peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors, and agents influencing hepatic steatosis synthesis, inflammatory pathways, genetic components, fibrosis mechanisms, and an array of other avenues. Over time, key regulatory directions have crystallized, now manifesting in 2 primary endpoints under investigation: resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening fibrosis and/or improvement of fibrosis stage without worsening of steatohepatitis, especially used in phase 3 clinical trials, while alternative noninvasive endpoints are explored in phase 2 trials. The prospect of proving efficacy in clinical trials opens doors to combination therapies, evaluating the ideal combination of drugs to yield comprehensive benefits, extending beyond the liver to other organs. Certain combination drug trials are already underway. In this review, we discuss the forefront of MASH drug research as of 2023/2024, illuminating mechanisms, outcomes, and future trajectories. Furthermore, we tackle the challenges confronting MASH trials and propose potential strategies for surmounting them.",,,38502810,L2033424752,10.1097/HEP.0000000000000860

Date of Publication: 2024","2024",,,,,"2024","Immunotherapy has revolutionised the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition, several phase III trials of immunotherapy in combination with surgical or locoregional therapies for early-to intermediate-stage HCC have recently reported positive results, and other phase III trials in the same patient population are currently in progress. As the application of immunotherapy is shifting to include patients with earlier stages of HCC, one looming question now emerges: What is the role of immunotherapy in the pre-liver transplant population? Liver transplantation is a potentially curative therapy for HCC and confers the additional advantage of restoring a normal, healthy liver. In pre-transplant patients, immunotherapy may improve downstaging success and tumour control at the cost of some immunologic risks. These include immune-related toxicities, which are particularly relevant in a uniquely vulnerable population with chronic liver disease, and the possibility of acute rejection after transplantation. Ultimately, the goal of immunotherapy in this population will be to effectively expand access to liver transplantation while preserving pre- and post-transplant outcomes. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms supporting combination immunotherapy, summarise key recent clinical data from major immunotherapy trials, and explore how immunotherapy can be applied in the neoadjuvant setting prior to liver transplantation in selected high-risk patients.",,,38848767,L2033539159,10.1016/j.jhep.2024.05.037
"Namodenoson inhibits the growth of pancreatic carcinoma via de-regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway","Fishman P., Bareket-Samish A., Izhak I.","Cancer Research (2024) 84:2 Supplement. Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2024","2024","84","2",,,"1 Jan 2024","Background: The Wnt/β-catenin pathway controls the growth of pancreatic carcinoma by regulating processes such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and the tumor immune microenvironment. Treating pancreatic cancer with Wnt pathway inhibitors was found to be toxic in clinical studies. Namodenoson, an A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) agonist, is under clinical development as a treatment of advanced liver cancer, where namodenoson was shown to have an excellent safety profile in phase II studies and is a phase III study is ongoing. The mechanism of action of namodenoson involves de-regulation of the Wnt and NF-κB signaling pathways, followed by an increase in pro-apoptotic proteins and Fas-ligand, resulting in tumor growth inhibition. The objectives of the currents study were to examine the anti-growth effect of namodenoson on pancreatic carcinoma cells both in vitro and in vivo and to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved. Methods: BxPC3 human pancreatic carcinoma cells were cultured in the presence and absence of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 nM namodenoson, or in the presence of a combination of namodenoson (0.1 nM) and gemcitabine (0.2 μM). Cell growth was monitored via 3 [H]-thymidine proliferation, MTT, and PrestoBlue assays. Western blot analyses were conducted to identify the regulatory cell growth proteins impacted by the treatment. A xenograft model with human BxPC-3 cells in nude mice was established to investigate the in-vivo effect of namodenoson. Results: A significant dose-dependent growth inhibition of BxPC-3 cells was observed with namodenoson in the3 [H]-thymidine proliferation assay (1 nM: 67.4% ± 1.7%, p < 0.001; 0.1 nM: 53.7% ± 6.3%, p< 0.05; 0.01 nM: 27.9 % ± 2.3%, p< 0.005). The combination of namodenoson and gemcitabine showed an additive inhibitory effect in the MTT assay (namodenoson: 48.6% ± 1.4%; gemcitabine: 44.4% ± 0.7%; namodenoson plus gemcitabine: 65.4% ± 1.4%; p<0.001 for all). Western blot analyses demonstrated that namodenoson treatment was associated with deregulation of the Wnt pathway regulatory proteins including p-Akt, NF- κB, GSK-3β, β-catenin and upregulation of the BAD and BAX apoptotic proteins. In the xenograft model, daily oral treatment with 10 μg/kg of namodenoson led to a significant progressive inhibition of tumor growth. Conclusions: Nanomolar concentrations of namodenoson inhibited the growth of pancreatic carcinoma in cell culture and in a xenograft model. This effect involved A3AR activation and de-regulation of the Wnt/β catenin pathway. Our results support a potential clinical utility for namodenoson in pancreatic cancer, a disease where an unmet clinical need exists, and novel therapeutic opportunities are required.",,,,L643357789,10.1158/1538-7445.PANCA2023-A074

Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2024","2024","42","3",,,"1 Jan 2024","Background: Neoadjuvant use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is feasible and achieves pathological responses in a subset of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it is not clear whether pathological response to ICI translates into long-term survival benefit. Methods: We analysed patient-level data from 86 subjects recruited to 4 prospective phase I/II clinical trials of ICI prior to liver resection (LR) in 9 centres in the United States, Europe, and Asia and included a cohort of 23 patients (pts) receiving neoadjuvant ICI off trial. Radiological response was assessed with RECISTv1.1. Major (MPR) and complete pathological response (pCR) were considered as $70% and 100% non-viable tumour in the resected specimen, respectively. Pathological responses were correlated with radiologic overall response rates (ORR) and relapse-free survival (RFS). Results: Out of 109 pts treated between 10/2017 and 09/ 2023, 55 pts (50.5%) received a double ICI combination, 35 (32.1%) ICI monotherapy, and 19 (17.4%) an antiangiogenic/ICI combination. In 19 pts (17.4%) an adjuvant ICI course was administered for a median time of 5.5 months (m) (interquartile range [IQR] 3.7-6.0). Most of pts were male (77.6%) with underlying viral chronic liver disease (68.2%), performance status 0 (83.5%), BCLC 0-A (55%), a median tumour diameter of 6.0 cm (IQR 3.9-9.9) without portal vein thrombosis (75.7%). After a median follow-up of 27.3 m (95% CI 21.5-33.0), 35 (32.1%) relapses and 14 (12.8%) deaths occurred. Radiologic ORR was 28.5% (n=31), with 3.7% complete responses (CR, n=4) and 24.8% partial responses (PR, n=27). Out of 100 pts evaluable for a pathological response, 33% achieved MPR and 19% pCR. MPR was more likely in patients who had achieved a radiologic PR or CR (82%) as compared to those who did not (14% p,0.001), however linear correlation suggested an imperfect correlation between ORR and MPR (R2 0.43, p,0.0001). Median RFS was 43.5m (95%CI, 27.5-59.6), while median overall survival was not reached (NR). mRFS was significantly improved in pts with MPR (NR vs 28.3m [95%CI, 13.1- 43.5], hazard ratio [HR] 0.27 [95%CI, 0.11-0.69], p = 0.003) and with pCR (NR vs 32.8m [95%CI, 15.2-50.4], HR 0.20 [95%CI, 0.05-0.82], p=0.013). Conclusions: This study is the first to qualify the role of MPR as a putative surrogate endpoint for recurrence-free survival in pts treated with neoadjuvant immunotherapy for HCC.

The most commonly utilized primary endpoint for phase III trials in aHCC is OS.A robust surrogate endpoint (SEP) can reduce time and financial costs of future trials and accelerate regulatory approvals of new therapies.We conducted a literature-based meta-analysis to evaluate SEPs for OS in aHCC. Methods: Randomized controlled trials evaluating systemic therapies in aHCC published 2007 - 2023 were identified through a systemic literature search of Cochrane and Medline databases as well as of abstracts presented at ASCO and ESMO meetings. Hazard ratios (HR) for OS and progressionfree survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP) were extracted. DORR was calculated as the difference in overall response rates (ORR) between control and experimental arms. Pearson correlation and mixed-effects meta-regression analyses were performed. Surrogate threshold effect (STE) was determined for each comparison when possible. A p , 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results: 26 trials were identified in the first-line setting with 14,827 patients and 11 trials in the subsequent-line setting with 5,316 patients. In first-line trials, immunotherapy (IO) is associated with higher ORR than other agents (p=0.003). There are statistically significant correlations between HRs of PFS/TTP/DORR and OS (Table). The relationship between HR-PFS and HR-OS persists in trials with or without IO, but only in trials enrolling , 30% patients of non-viral aetiologies. In subsequent-line trials, there are statistically significant correlations between HRs of PFS/TTP and OS (Table). STE for HR PFS is 0.68 and 0.87 respectively for 1st and subsequent line trials. Conclusions: There are moderate to strong correlations between PFS and OS in aHCC in first-line and subsequent line trials. STE for HR-PFS of 0.68 in first-line and 0.87 in subsequent-line settings can guide sample size calculation in future clinical trials.",,,,L643533862,

Cam + rivo significantly improved median overall survival ([mOS] 22.1 months [mo] vs 15.1 mo) and median progression-free survival ([mPFS] 5.6 mo vs 3.7 mo) compared to sora. This post-hoc analysis evaluated the impact of baseline albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade and Child-Pugh (CP) class on survival outcomes. Methods: In this randomized, open-label, international, multicenter, phase 3 study, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive cam 200 mg IV Q2W + rivo 250 mg PO QD (n=272) or sora 400 mg PO BID (n=271). Median overall survival (mOS), median progression free survival (mPFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety were assessed by baseline ALBI grade and CP class. Results: mOS, mPFS, DCR, and ORR improved with cam + rivo vs sora regardless of baseline liver function (Table). Although treatment-related grade 3/4 AEs occurred at a greater rate in the cam + rivo arm vs the sora arm, the rate of these events was similar for patients with baseline ALBI grade 1 and grade 2 (cam + rivo, 82.1% and 81.7% vs sora, 53.9% and 54.0%, respectively). Median time-to-deterioration (mTTD) to CP class B was similar between treatment arms for ALBI grade 1 (not evaluable [NE], NE) and grade 2 (cam + rivo, 10.1 mo; sora, 10.6 mo; HR, 0.99). Conclusions: In this post-hoc analysis of Study CARES- 310, the efficacy of cam + rivo was superior to sora regardless of baseline liver function as measured by both ALBI grade and CP class. Despite a higher rate of grade 3/4 AEs, there was no detrimental effect of cam +rivo on liver function in patients with both well- and moderatelypreserved liver function compared to sora. These results support cam + rivo as a potential new first-line treatment option for patients with uHCC regardless of baseline liver function. Clinical trial information: NCT03764293.",,,,L643533937,

Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2024","2024","42","3",,,"1 Jan 2024","Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest-growing cancer in the US with more age-adjusted incident cases in Hispanics compared to non-Hispanics. Immunotherapies are considered integral part of treatment for most unresectable HCC. Recent multinational phase III trials suggest the benefit of immunotherapies may differ based on geographic region and underlying etiology of HCC. We hypothesized that Hispanic ethnicity might influence responses to immunotherapy in HCC. Methods: We analyzed the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to assess the impact of immunotherapy on overall survival (OS) in Hispanic patients with HCC. The database was queried for liver cancer from 2004 to 2020. Kaplan Meier method was used to assess OS and a log-rank test was used to compare survival distribution between Hispanic and non-Hispanic groups. Cox regression analysis was performed to estimate the adjusted effect of ethnicity on OS based on immunotherapy status. NCDB is a joint project of the Commission on Cancer (CoC) of the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society. The CoC's NCDBand the hospitals participating in the CoC ∼ Os NCDB are the source of the de-identified data used herein. Results: A total of 225079 patients were identified of whom 2036 patients (0.9%) received immunotherapy as first-line treatment. Patients with non- Hispanic ethnicity, male sex, who received treatment at academic/research institutions, and were insured were more likely to receive immunotherapy. In the entire cohort, there was no difference (p=0.94) in survival between those who did not receive immunotherapy (median OS,11.63 months; IQR: 2.79, 34.83) vs. those who did (median OS, 10.68 months, IQR: 5.19, 23.29 [DA2]). There were more Hispanics in the cohort who did not receive immunotherapy (12.28% vs. 10.61%). In the adjusted Cox analysis, Hispanics had a reduced risk of death than non- Hispanics among patients who did not receive immunotherapy (HR: 0.873, 95%CI, 0.858- 0.889; p<0.001). Among patients with immunotherapy, there was no OS difference between ethnicities (HR 0.904, 95% CI, 0.755-1.082; p 0.271). Conclusions: Hispanics were less likely to receive immunotherapy than non-Hispanics. Although Hispanics had a better OS than non- Hispanics among patients without immunotherapy, the differences no longer persist among patients who received immunotherapy. These findings suggest that Hispanic ethnicity may influence responses to immunotherapy. As compared to non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics with HCC have significantly more nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease as contributing factors. A better understanding of the impact of immunotherapies on alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease-related HCC is needed.",,,,L643533971,

The REFINE real-world study (NCT03289273) assessed a more varied pt population treated with regorafenib than the phase 3 RESORCE trial.1 Median overall survival (OS) in REFINE was 13.2 months and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were consistent with RESORCE. We present a subgroup analysis of outcomes in pts from REFINE with CP-B liver function. Methods: REFINE is an international, prospective observational study of pts with uHCC for whom the decision to treat with regorafenib according to the local health authority approved label was made by their physician before enrollment. The primary endpoints were safety (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities v25) and dose modifications due to drugrelated TEAEs. Secondary endpoints included OS and duration of treatment (DoT). Results: Of 1005 evaluable pts, 123 (12%) were classified as CP-B at study entry, with most being CP-B7 (Table).

Median DoT with regorafenib was 2.3 months in CP-B pts and 3.7 months in the overall cohort. Incidence rates of TEAEs in CP-B pts and the overall cohort were similar (93% and 92%) and TEAEs were drug-related in 70% and 74% of pts, respectively. Grade 3-4 TEAEs occurred in 41% of CP-B pts and 39% of the overall cohort and were drug-related in 27% and 26% of pts, respectively. Serious TEAEs were observed in 48% of CP-B pts and 37% of the overall cohort, and were drug-related in 11% and 9% of pts, respectively. Drug-related TEAEs led to less frequent dose modifications in CP-B pts than in the overall cohort (28% vs 37%), but more frequent permanent discontinuations (28% vs 16%). Median OS in CP-B pts was 6.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.9, 7.8) months and in CP-B7 pts was 6.7 (95% CI 5.1, 8.7) months. Conclusions: In REFINE, pts with uHCC and CP-B liver function had similar rates of grade 3-4 TEAEs, but a higher occurrence of serious TEAEs due to underlying cirrhosis led to more frequent permanent discontinuations in CP-B pts. Median OS in CP-B7 pts was comparable with OS in CP-B pts overall.

However, the study highlighted the activity of len + pembro and, given the late separation of Kaplan-Meier survival curves for OS and PFS between treatment arms from 12mo onwards, outcomes with extended follow-up are of interest. We report results after 12 mo of additional follow-up (median 43.6 mo). Methods: Eligible pts with advanced HCC were randomized 1:1 to len (8 mg/day if bodyweight [BW] <60 kg; 12 mg/day if BW ≥60 kg) + pembro (200 mg IV Q3W) or len + pbo. Dual primary end points were OS and PFS (per RECIST v1.1 by BICR). Secondary end points included ORR and DOR, both per RECIST v1.1 by BICR, and safety. Data cutoff was June 6, 2023. Results: 794 pts were randomly assigned to receive len + pembro (n = 395) or len + pbo (n = 399). Median follow-up was 43.6 mo (range, 37.3-52.6), and treatment was ongoing in 25 (3.2%) pts. Median OS was 21.1 mo with len + pembro vs 19.0 mo with len + pbo (HR, 0.836; 95% CI, 0.713-0.981). OS rates for len + pembro vs len + pbo were 43.4% vs 40.0% at 24 mo, 32.7% vs 24.3% at 36 mo, and 22.4% vs 15.3% at 48 mo. Median PFS was 8.2 mo with len + pembro vs 8.1 mo with len + pbo (HR, 0.810; 95% CI, 0.692-0.949). PFS rates for len + pembro vs len + pbo were 16.4% vs 9.7% at 24moand 14.1% vs 3.3% at 36 mo.ORR was 26.3% for len + pembro vs 17.5% for len + pbo. Median DOR was 16.6 mo (range, 2.0+ to 45.3+) for len + pembro vs 10.4 mo (range, 1.9 to 37.0+) for len + pbo. Grade 3-5 treatmentrelated adverse event (TRAE) rates were 62.8% in the len + pembro arm and 58.0% in the len + pbo arm. No additional deaths due to TRAEs were reported. The most common TRAEs of any grade in the len + pembro vs len + pbo arms were hypertension (43.8% vs 46.8%), diarrhea (40.8% vs 34.2%), and hypothyroidism (40.0% vs 35.9%). Overall, 46.6% vs 55.4% of pts received ≥1 poststudy systemic anticancer treatment. Conclusions: With an additional 12 mo of follow-up, the LEAP-002 primary end points of OS and PFS for len + pembro vs len + pbo remained consistent with the primary efficacy analyses; no new safety signals were observed. The median OS of 19.0mo with len monotherapy continues to support its role as a standard-ofcare treatment in 1L advanced HCC. The activity of len + pembro for pts with advanced HCC observed in this study supports the evaluation of TACE 6 len + pembro for intermediate-stage HCC in the ongoing phase 3 LEAP-012 study (NCT04246177).",,,,L643534362,
"Cost-utility analysis of sequential therapy with sorafenib followed by regorafenib versus single-line therapies in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma","Grossman J., Fawsitt C., Aceituno D., Paracha N., Ozgurdal K., Thom H.","Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024) 42:3 Supplement. Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2024","2024","42","3",,,"1 Jan 2024","Background: Regorafenib is the only licensed second-line therapy available for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that progress on first-line sorafenib in the UK. We evaluated the lifetime cost-effectiveness of a sequence of treatment with sorafenib followed by regorafenib (SOR-REG) compared with licensed single-line therapies for which there is no clear sequencing options available, including atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (ATEZO+BEV), which has become the standard of care in first-line treatment, as well as lenvatinib (LEN), followed by best supportive care (BSC). Methods: Assuming a UK National Health Service and Social Services perspective, we developed a probabilistic individual-level semi-Markov model with states reflecting progression-free survival, progression following first-line treatment, further progression following second-line treatment, and death. First-line overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were informed by fractional polynomials network metaanalysis of published trials. Individual patient data from a phase 3 trial (RESORCE) on regorafenib and BSC informed OS and PFS in the second-line setting. Costs and utilities were sourced from published studies. Cost-effectiveness was summarized using incremental net monetary benefit (INMB), which could be positive or negative depending on direction of expected benefit associated with SOR-REG, and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. Results: We found 1000 probabilistic samples and 1000 patients were sufficient for convergence. Lifetime costs were highest with ATEZO-BEV ([£80,963 [95% CI: £11,022, £97,369]), followed by SOR-REG (£38,373 [£31,064, £43,420]) and LEN (£37,351 [£5,020, £55,800]). Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were highest with ATEZO+- BEV (1.021 [0.152, 1.239), followed by SOR-REG (0.942 [0.802, 1.057]) and LEN (0.755, [0.094, 1.092]). At a WTP threshold of £30,000 / QALY gained, SOR-REG had an INMB of £40,211 (95% CI -£2,099, £52,731) and £4,589 (-£8,044, £14,481) versus ATEZO+BEV and LEN, respectively. Conclusions: A sequence of SOR-REG for patients with advanced HCC is cost-effective at WTP thresholds of £30,000 / QALY gained due to lower lifetime costs and broadly comparable QALY gains with single-line ATEZO-BEV and LEN in the UK. Broader second-line treatment options are needed for patients receiving ATEZO+BEV and LEN as first-line therapies.",,,,L643534459,

Date of Publication: 31 Dec 2023","2023","12","6",,,"31 Dec 2023","Background and Objective: Tumor treating fields (TTFields) therapy have emerged as a potentially effective treatment for various malignancies by delivering low-intensity, intermediate-frequency electrical fields that disrupt many processes inside cells, resulting in the interruption of cell division in cancer cells. Additionally, TTFields therapy has been found to be synergistic with existing therapeutic approaches. In this review, we provide an introduction and background to the primary mechanisms of TTFields and discuss the emerging preclinical and clinical outcomes of this novel cancer treatment technology. Methods: We performed a literature search on PubMed, ClinicalTrials.Gov, and Google Scholar using the terms ‘TTFields’ and ‘cancer’. We included studies, review articles, and editorials published in English from 1st January 2000 to 1st October 2023. All obtained publications were reviewed and their key references are cross-checked to ensure a balanced and high-quality review. Key Content and Findings: Clinical studies reported to date have demonstrated the survival advantage of TTFields therapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and meaningful clinical activity in recurrent GBM (rGBM) and malignant pleural mesothelioma. Moreover, TTFields therapy has exhibited promising safety profiles across a diverse range of cancers including pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ovarian cancer, NSCLC, and gastric cancer, when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy regimens, suggesting broad applicability as an added treatment modality. Conclusions: Based on preclinical and clinical studies, TTFields therapy show promise as a potential treatment option for patients with a number of different malignancies, offering a favorable safety profile and the potential for significant clinical benefit. Further research is warranted to establish the optimal treatment parameters and identify specific patient subgroups that may derive the greatest advantage from this treatment modality.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00379470, NCT00749346, NCT00916409, NCT01755624, NCT01894061, NCT01971281, NCT02244502, NCT02397928, NCT02831959, NCT02973789, NCT03203525, NCT03377491, NCT03606590, NCT03940196, NCT04281576, NCT04471844, NCT04605913, NCT04892472, NCT05004025, NCT05092373, NCT05310448, NCT05341349, NCT05679674, NCT05746325)",,37953242,L2029776495,10.21037/cco-23-82

The programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor tislelizumab demonstrated efficacy and a tolerable safety profile as second-line HCC treatment. Objective: To investigate efficacy and safety of tislelizumab vs sorafenib tosylate for first-line treatment of unresectable HCC. Design, Setting, and Participants: The open-label, global, multiregional phase 3 RATIONALE-301 randomized clinical trial enrolled systemic therapy-naive adults with histologically confirmed HCC, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C disease, disease progression following (or patient was not amenable to) locoregional therapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less, and Child-Pugh class A, between December 27, 2017, and October 2, 2019. Data cutoff was July 11, 2022. Intervention: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive tislelizumab, 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, or sorafenib tosylate, 400 mg orally twice daily. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was overall survival (OS); secondary end points included objective response rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, and safety. Results: A total of 674 patients were included in the analysis (570 men [84.6%]; median age, 61 years [range, 23-86 years]). As of July 11, 2022, minimum study follow-up was 33 months. The primary end point of OS noninferiority of tislelizumab vs sorafenib was met in the intention-to-treat population (n = 674); median overall survival was 15.9 (95% CI, 13.2-19.7) months vs 14.1 (95% CI, 12.6-17.4) months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85 [95.003% CI, 0.71-1.02]), and superiority of tislelizumab vs sorafenib was not met. The objective response rate was 14.3% (n = 49) for tislelizumab vs 5.4% (n = 18) for sorafenib, and median duration of response was 36.1 (95% CI, 16.8 to not evaluable) months vs 11.0 (95% CI, 6.2-14.7) months, respectively. Median progression-free survival was 2.1 (95% CI, 2.1-3.5) months vs 3.4 (95% CI, 2.2-4.1) months with tislelizumab vs sorafenib (HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.92-1.33]). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) was 96.2% (325 of 338 patients) for tislelizumab and 100% (n = 324) for sorafenib. Grade 3 or greater treatment-related AEs were reported in 75 patients (22.2%) receiving tislelizumab and 173 (53.4%) receiving sorafenib. There was a lower incidence of treatment-related AEs leading to drug discontinuation (21 [6.2%] vs 33 [10.2%]) and drug modification (68 [20.1%] vs 187 [57.7%]) with tislelizumab vs sorafenib. Conclusions and Relevance: In RATIONALE-301, tislelizumab demonstrated OS benefit that was noninferior vs sorafenib, with a higher objective response rate and more durable responses, while median progression-free survival was longer with sorafenib.

The IMbrave050 trial, comparing adjuvant atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab to active surveillance following curative-intent resection or ablation, was the first to report, fast-tracking the results of the first interim analysis and demonstrating an improvement in recurrence free survival. The trial has provoked a discussion on the horizon of expectations from adjuvant treatment and the clinical relevance of efficacy endpoints.

Here, we report the efficacy and safety of combining toripalimab, lenvatinib, and gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX) as first-line therapy for advanced ICC. Thirty patients with pathologically confirmed advanced ICC received intravenous gemcitabine (1 g/m(2)) on Days 1 and 8 and oxaliplatin (85 mg/m(2)) Q3W for six cycles along with intravenous toripalimab (240 mg) Q3W and oral lenvatinib (8 mg) once daily for one year. The expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and genetic status was investigated in paraffin-embedded tissues using immunohistochemistry and whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes included safety, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR) and duration of response (DoR). As of July 1, 2022, the median follow-up time was 23.5 months, and the ORR was 80%. Twenty-three patients achieved partial response, and one achieved complete response. Patients (21/30) with DNA damage response (DDR)-related gene mutations showed a higher ORR, while patients (14/30) with tumor area positivity ≥1 (PD-L1 staining) showed a trend of high ORR, but without significant difference. The median OS, PFS, and DoR were 22.5, 10.2, and 11.0 months, respectively. The DCR was 93.3%.

Objective: As studies read out simultaneously, strategic planning of population pharmacokinetic model development and evaluation is required to ensure timely decisions. Methods: Data from healthy participants and patients from 12 clinical trials between December 2014 and July 2021 were included: seven phase I studies in healthy participants and organ impairment, five phase II/III studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, alopecia areata, and vitiligo. Population pharmacokinetic models consisted of stepwise procedures to accommodate data availability and the model’s application to answering clinical development questions. At each iteration of the model update, parameters of the next model were re-estimated by leveraging previous information and new data. Results: Three model development lifecycle iterations of the ritlecitinib population pharmacokinetic model were conducted to support alopecia areata, vitiligo, and ulcerative colitis study readouts. Initial structural modeling based on healthy participant data (and some rheumatoid arthritis and alopecia areata data) in iteration 1 provided a platform for comprehensive covariate testing during iteration 2, and model evaluation and implementation of the frequentist prior approach in iteration 3. The final model was a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and direct-response non-stationary clearance and bioavailability driven by concentrations in the peripheral compartment. Conclusions: The present approach demonstrated the evolution of three population pharmacokinetic models with accumulating data, addressed clinical drug development questions related to systemic exposures of ritlecitinib, and informed the approved product label.

The occurrence and progression of HCC are closely related to immune elimination, immune homeostasis, and immune escape of the immune system. In recent years, immunotherapy, represented by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has shown powerful anti-tumor capabilities in HCC patients. However, there are still some HCC patients who cannot benefit from ICIs treatment due to their innate or acquired drug resistance. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to explore the possible mechanisms of resistance to ICIs in HCC and to use them as a target to design strategies to reverse resistance, to overcome drug resistance in HCC and to improve the prognosis of patients. This article summarizes the possible primary (tumor microenvironment alteration, and signaling pathways, etc.) and acquired (immune checkpoint upregulation) resistance mechanisms in patients with HCC treated with ICIs, and based on this, discusses the status and effectiveness of combination drug strategy to reverse drug resistance, to provide a reference for subsequent related studies and decisions.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01658878, NCT02519348, NCT02572687, NCT02715531, NCT03006926, NCT03092895, NCT03203304, NCT03289533, NCT03298451, NCT03380130, NCT03434379, NCT03463876, NCT03713593, NCT03755791, NCT03764293, NCT03794440)",,37917364,L2026424050,10.1007/s00262-023-03568-3

While entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) were both recommended as first-line therapies for HBV patients, recent retrospective studies proposed a lower incidence rate of HCC occurrence or recurrence in those receiving TDF compared ETV. However, the survival benefits of switching to TDF therapy after prolonged ETV treatment before surgery remain uncertain. We delineate the rationale and design of SWITE, a randomized, open-label, phase III trial contrasting TDF switch therapy versus ETV maintenance in HBV-related HCC patients. Methods and analysis: This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-center study with two parallel groups of patients with HBV-related HCC who have received long-term ETV therapy before surgery. West China Hospital will enroll 238 patients, randomized in a 1:1 ratio to TDF switch therapy or ETV maintenance after surgery. The primary endpoint of this study is 3-year recurrence free survival (RFS), with the secondary endpoint being 3-year overall survival (OS) after curative surgery of HCC.

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2023","2023","15","1",,,"1 Dec 2023","Background: Increasing number of studies reported the positive effect of metformin on the prevention and treatment of cancers. However, the genetic causal effect of metformin utilization on the risk of common cancers was not completely demonstrated. Methods: Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (two-sample MR) analysis was conducted to uncover the genetically predicted causal association between metformin use and 26 kinds of cancers. Besides, two-step Mendelian Randomization (two-step MR) assessment was applied to clarify the mediators which mediated the causal effect of metformin on certain cancer. We utilized five robust analytical methods, in which the inverse variance weighting (IVW) method served as the major one. Sensitivity, pleiotropy, and heterogeneity were assessed. The genetic statistics of exposure, outcomes, and mediators were downloaded from publicly available datasets, including the Open Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), FinnGen consortium (FinnGen), and UK Biobank (UKB). Results: Among 26 kinds of common cancers, HER-positive breast cancer was presented with a significant causal relationship with metformin use [Beta: − 4.0982; OR: 0.0166 (95% CI: 0.0008, 0.3376); P value: 0.0077], which indicated metformin could prevent people from HER-positive breast cancer. Other cancers only showed modest associations with metformin use. Potential mediators were included in two-step MR, among which total testosterone levels (mediating effect: 24.52%) displayed significant mediating roles. Leave-one-out, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO analyses produced consistent outcomes. Conclusion: Metformin use exhibited a genetically protective effect on HER-positive breast cancer, which was partially mediated by total testosterone levels.",,,,L2026973915,10.1186/s13098-023-01218-3

This study aimed to review clinical research on artemisinin and its derivatives except anti-malaria and explore possible priority areas for future development. Methods: Relevant articles in English and Chinese published before 28 October 2021 were reviewed. All articles were retrieved and obtained from databases including WanFang, PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge International, Embase, OpenGrey, the Grey Literature Report, Grey Horizon, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies were selected for final inclusion based on predefined criteria. Information was then extracted and analyzed by region, disease, outcome, and time to identify relevant knowledge gaps. Results: Seventy-seven studies on anti-parasitic (35), anti-tumor (16), anti-inflammatory (12), anti-viral (8), and dermatological treatments (7) focused on the safety and efficacy of artemisinin and its derivatives. The anti-parasitic clinical research developed rapidly, with a large number of trials, rapid clinical progress, and multiple research topics. In contrast, anti-viral research was limited and mainly stayed in phase I clinical trials (37.50%). Most of the studies were conducted in Asia (60%), followed by Africa (27%), Europe (8%), and the Americas (5%). Anti-parasite and anti-inflammatory research were mainly distributed in less developed continents such as Asia and Africa, while cutting-edge research such as anti-tumor has attracted more attention in Europe and the United States. At the safety level, 58 articles mentioned the adverse reactions of artemisinin and its derivatives, with only one study showing a Grade 3 adverse event, while the other studies did not show any related adverse reactions or required discontinuation. Most studies have discovered therapeutic effects of artemisinin or its derivatives on anti-parasitic (27), anti-tumor (9), anti-inflammatory (9) and dermatological treatment (6). However, the efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for parasitic diseases (non-malaria) is still controversial. Conclusions: Recent clinical studies suggest that artemisinin and its derivatives may be safe and effective candidates for anti-tumor, anti-parasitic, anti-inflammatory and dermatological drugs. More phase II/III clinical trials of artemisinin and its derivatives on antiviral effects are needed.

However, the clinical failure of cilengitide, a specific inhibitor targeting surface CD51, suggests the importance of yet-unknown mechanisms by which CD51 promotes tumor progression. Methods: In this study, we used several hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and murine hepatoma cell lines. To investigate the role of CD51 on HCC progression, we used a 3D invasion assay and in vivo bioluminescence imaging. We used periostin-knockout transgenic mice to uncover the role of the tumor microenvironment on CD51 cleavage. Moreover, we used several clinically relevant HCC models, including patient-derived organoids and patient-derived xenografts, to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of cilengitide in combination with the γ-secretase inhibitor LY3039478. Results: We found that CD51 could undergo transmembrane cleavage by γ-secretase to produce a functional intracellular domain (CD51-ICD). The cleaved CD51-ICD facilitated HCC invasion and metastasis by promoting the transcription of oxidative phosphorylation-related genes. Furthermore, we identified cancer-associated fibroblast-derived periostin as the major driver of CD51 cleavage. Lastly, we showed that cilengitide-based therapy led to a dramatic therapeutic effect when supplemented with LY3039478 in both patient-derived organoid and xenograft models. Conclusions: In summary, we revealed previously unrecognized mechanisms by which CD51 is involved in HCC progression and uncovered the underlying cause of cilengitide treatment failure, as well as providing evidence supporting the translational prospects of combined CD51-targeted therapy in the clinic. Impact and implications: Integrin αv (CD51) is a widely recognized pro-tumoral molecule that plays a crucial role in various stages of tumor progression, making it a promising therapeutic target. However, despite early promising results, cilengitide, a specific antagonist of CD51, failed in a phase III clinical trial. This prompted further investigation into the underlying mechanisms of CD51's effects. This study reveals that the γ-secretase complex directly cleaves CD51 to produce an intracellular domain (CD51-ICD), which functions as a pro-tumoral transcriptional regulator and can bypass the inhibitory effects of cilengitide by entering the nucleus. Furthermore, the localization of CD51 in the nucleus is significantly associated with the prognosis of patients with HCC. These findings provide a theoretical basis for re-evaluating cilengitide in clinical settings and highlight the importance of identifying a more precise patient subpopulation for future clinical trials targeting CD51.",,,37604269,L2028335315,10.1016/j.jhep.2023.08.007

Methods: In this global, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 study (LEAP-002), patients aged 18 years or older with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, Child Pugh class A liver disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and no previous systemic treatment were enrolled at 172 global sites. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a central interactive voice-response system (block size of 4) to receive lenvatinib (bodyweight <60 kg, 8 mg/day; bodyweight ≥60 kg, 12 mg/day) plus pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) or lenvatinib plus placebo. Randomisation was stratified by geographical region, macrovascular portal vein invasion or extrahepatic spread or both, α-fetoprotein concentration, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. Dual primary endpoints were overall survival (superiority threshold at final overall survival analysis, one-sided p=0·019; final analysis to occur after 532 events) and progression-free survival (superiority threshold one-sided p=0·002; final analysis to occur after 571 events) in the intention-to-treat population.

Findings: Between Jan 17, 2019, and April 28, 2020, of 1309 patients assessed, 794 were randomly assigned to lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (n=395) or lenvatinib plus placebo (n=399). Median age was 66·0 years (IQR 57·0–72·0), 644 (81%) of 794 were male, 150 (19%) were female, 345 (43%) were Asian, 345 (43%) were White, 22 (3%) were multiple races, 21 (3%) were American Indian or Alaska Native, 21 (3%) were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 13 (2%) were Black or African American, and 46 (6%) did not have available race data. Median follow up as of data cutoff for the final analysis (June 21, 2022) was 32·1 months (IQR 29·4–35·3). Median overall survival was 21·2 months (95% CI 19·0–23·6; 252 [64%] of 395 died) with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus 19·0 months (17·2–21·7; 282 [71%] of 399 died) with lenvatinib plus placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·84; 95% CI 0·71–1·00; stratified log-rank p=0·023). As of data cutoff for the progression-free survival final analysis (April 5, 2021), median progression-free survival was 8·2 months (95% CI 6·4–8·4; 270 events occurred [42 deaths; 228 progressions]) with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus 8·0 months (6·3–8·2; 301 events occurred [36 deaths; 265 progressions]) with lenvatinib plus placebo (HR 0·87; 95% CI 0·73–1·02; stratified log-rank p=0·047). The most common treatment-related grade 3–4 adverse events were hypertension (69 [17%] of 395 patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group vs 68 [17%] of 395 patients) in the lenvatinib plus placebo group), increased aspartate aminotransferase (27 [7%] vs 17 [4%]), and diarrhoea (25 [6%] vs 15 [4%]). Treatment-related deaths occurred in four (1%) patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group (due to gastrointestinal haemorrhage and hepatorenal syndrome [n=1 each] and hepatic encephalopathy [n=2]) and in three (1%) patients in the lenvatinib plus placebo group (due to gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatorenal syndrome, and cerebrovascular accident [n=1 each]). Interpretation: In earlier studies, the addition of pembrolizumab to lenvatinib as first-line therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma has shown promising clinical activity; however, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab did not meet prespecified significance for improved overall survival and progression-free survival versus lenvatinib plus placebo.

HIMALAYA looked at treatment with one dose of a medication called tremelimumab combined with multiple doses of a medication called durvalumab (the STRIDE regimen) or multiple doses of durvalumab alone. These treatments were compared with a medication called sorafenib in participants with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is a type of liver cancer that is difficult to treat because it is often diagnosed when it is unresectable, meaning it can no longer be removed with surgery. Sorafenib has been the main treatment for unresectable HCC since 2007. However, people who take sorafenib may experience side effects that can reduce their quality of life, so alternative medicines are being trialed. Tremelimumab and durvalumab are types of drugs called immunotherapies, and they both work in different ways to help the body’s immune system fight cancer.",,,37671641,L2029223004,10.2217/fon-2023-0486

Althoughrare, theirincidenceisincreasingandtheir prognosisremains poor, with an overall survival rate (OS) estimated at less than 20% at five years, all stages combined. Only 20-30% of patients with BTC are eligible for potentially curative surgery at diagnosis, of whom 50-70% will have a recurrence. Because of this high risk of recurrence, adjuvant treatment is recommended. Since 2018, several phase III trials have clarified the adjuvant strategy for BTC. Gemcitabine ± platinum-based chemotherapy, used in advanced stages, did not significantly improve OS in the adjuvant setting. The BILCAP trial, although negative on its primary objective, reported a benefit in terms of OS and disease-free survival, making capecitabine for 6 months in adjuvant setting the standard of care for resected cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder adenocarcinoma. A comparison between capecitabine and gemcitabine + platinum chemotherapy is still being studied in a large-scale phase III trial (ACTICCA-1 [NCT02170090]), which results are expected in 2025. Adjuvant radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy have only been assessed in single-arm phase II trials and have never been prospectively compared with chemotherapy alone: they are therefore not currently recommended. Immunotherapy and molecular targeting strategies developed in recent years for advanced cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder adenocarcinoma (especiallyFGFR2rearrangements, IDH1mutations, microsatelliteinstability, HER2 overexpression) have not been evaluated in the adjuvant setting. Encouraging the inclusion of these patients in clinical research protocols will help to better define their place in personalized adjuvant strategies in the future.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02170090)",,,L2030676982,10.1684/hpg.2023.2678

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2023","2023","39",,"S5",,"1 Dec 2023","Introduction: In the RESORCE trial, regorafenib was shown to provide overall survival (OS) benefit for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that has progressed on sorafenib treatment. Subsequently, it was approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for the treatment of patients with HCC who were previously treated with sorafenib; however, regorafenib is still not recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee in Australia. We aimed to assess the cost effectiveness of regorafenib as a secondline therapy for patients withHCC who progressed on sorafenib from an Australian healthcare perspective. Methods: We developed a Markov model to compare the cost effectiveness of regorafenib with best supportive care (BSC) as a second-line therapy for HCC after treatment with sorafenib. The health outcomes of life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were derived from the RESORCE trial. Survival benefits sourced from the RESORCE trial were fitted with the parametric model to estimate survival beyond the follow-up period. Drug costs and costs associated with adverse events (AEs) were sourced from published literature and the Independent Health and Aged Care Pricing Authority cost report. Model validity was verified using probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: The incremental monthly cost of treatment with regorafenib was AUD19,273 (USD13,374), with an incremental life-year gain of 0.38, compared with BSC. The incremental QALYs gained with regorafenib were 0.24, resulting in a base-case incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) of AUD80,511 (USD55,872) per QALY. In the probabilistic sensitivity analyses across scenarios, the ICER remained above the conventional threshold of AUD50,000 (USD34,698) per QALY, with a zero probability of being cost effective at this willingness-to-pay threshold. Conclusions: At the current price, second-line treatment with regorafenib in patients with HCC that has progressed on sorafenib was not cost effective at the conventional willingness-to-pay threshold from an Australian health-system perspective.",,,,L643239909,10.1017/S0266462323000636
"The Potential Role of Systemic Therapy in Intermediate-Stage HCC: A Paradigm Shift?","Kudo M.","Liver Cancer (2023) 12 Supplement 1 (S8-S9). Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2023","2023","12",,"S8","S9","1 Dec 2023","There has been interest in combining systemic and locoregional therapies (LRTs) to increase objective responses, progression- free survival (PFS), and overall survival. Systemic therapy with TKIs has several theoretical benefits, as follows: (1) inducing tumor necrosis, thereby potentially achieving downstaging; (2) reducing hypoxic stress caused by TACE, thus aiming to suppress the hypoxia-induced release of cytokines (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]), which could prime progression and metastasis; and (3) normalizing tumor vasculature, which could enhance the effect of TACE. These theoretical benefits prompted several trials evaluating the combination of sorafenib and TACE, with all failing to show any benefit in the primary outcomes of time to progression (TTP) or PFS. Recently, the Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization Therapy In Combination with Sorafenib (TACTICS) trial showed that the combination of sorafenib plus TACE improved PFS (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41-0.78) compared with TACE alone, although this failed to translate into an OS benefit (36.2 vs 30.8 mo, respectively; HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.61-1.22). At this time, existing phase II and phase III studies have failed to show a benefit in proposed primary outcomes. However, there have been questions if overall survival is the optimal primary end point of LRTs, particularly considering continued improvements in postprogression therapies, highlighting a need for validated, accurate, surrogate measures that can be used in clinical trials. Although a moderate correlation between PFS and overall survival has been suggested in systemic therapy trials, it is unclear if this is true for LRTs because prior trials evaluating combination studies failed to show any correlation (r . 0.56). With the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the advanced-stage setting, there has been renewed interest in evaluating the combination of systemic and LRTs. It is theorized that TACE may induce release of neoantigens, which then could augment responses with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, resulting in synergistic effects by using the 2 in combination. Accordingly, there are several ongoing phase III studies evaluating TACE in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.",,,,L643276733,10.1159/000531751

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2023","2023","12",,"S10",,"1 Dec 2023","The landscape of systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been evolving rapidly over the past years. In two global, multi-center, randomized phase III trials of firstline systemic therapy for unresectable HCC (IMbrave 150 study and HIMALAYA study), the combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (atezo/bev) and the combination of durvalumab plus tremelimumab (the STRIDE regimen) outperformed sorafenib with a statistically significant improvement of overall survival (OS). Most treatment guidelines around the World, thus, recommend that both combinations as the preferred first-line systemic therapy for advanced HCC, and that multikinase inhibitors could be considered in cases where the previous options are contraindicated. Although these recommendations appear to be in line with the results of the afore-mentioned randomized phase III trials, they do not genuinely reflect the fact that no direct comparison of atezo/bev or the STRIDE regimen with lenvatinib as firstline therapy for advanced HCC has ever been investigated in prospective clinical trials. Moreover, several retrospective cohort studies suggest that the efficacy of lenvatinib may be comparable with that of atezo/bev as first-line therapy for advanced HCC. Overall, multikinase inhibitors including lenvatinib remain an important class of agents as first-line therapy for advanced HCC. Following failure of first-line multikinase inhibitors especially lenvatinib, multiple treatment options are available, including toadd- on and to-switch strategies. The former strategy can be achieved by agents with the same anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) property plus additional mechanisms of action (MOAs), or by agents with anti-VEGF/ VEGFR property in combination with other agents with different MOAs such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The latter strategy is to switch to ICIs or their combinations as second-line therapy. The presentation will review the current data focusing on the subsequent treatment options following lenvatinib and will discuss future research directions regarding optimal sequential therapy following multikinase inhibitor therapy for advanced HCC.",,,,L643276753,10.1159/000531751

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2023","2023","12",,"S11",,"1 Dec 2023","Adjuvant immunotherapy (AI) after resection of operable HCC has recently welcomed the first successful attempt - IMbrave 050 trials, in which one year of atezo-bev significantly improved recurrence-free survival (Chow P et al AACR 2023). True neoadjuvant or perioperative (pre-op + post-op) adjuvant immunotherapy is relatively difficult in HCC, as clinically resectable HCC is often firsthandly resected. Until now, only a few very small-sized pilot studies are reported. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy (NAI) has a notable hypothetical benefit over AI. While AI is given after resection of tumors, NAI is given to an intact tumor bed, which harbour abundant anti-tumor immune cells. Activation of the latter is expected to activate the largest possible amount of the cytotoxic anti-tumor CD8 T cells, which would help eradicate micro-metastases. This notion has been validated in malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer. We have recently completed a relatively large series (N=43) of neo-adjuvant phase II trial by TCOG (Taiwan Cooperative Oncology Group). Potentially resectable HCC patients received 2-4 courses of ipilimumab plus nivolumab before resection. Among the 24 patients resected, major pathologic response (> 90% necrosis) was observed in 8 (33.3%) patients. Patients after resection enjoyed a significantly better overall survival. These results support the use of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in potentially resectable HCC patients. However, it remains to be seen whether large-scale phase III trials of neoadjuvant immunotherapy on truly resectable HCC patients can also be done in the future.",,,,L643276773,10.1159/000531751

NEJM Evid 2022). Here, we report an updated 4-year OS analysis of HIMALAYA. Methods: Participants with uHCC and no previous systemic treatment were randomized to STRIDE (tremelimumab 300 mg for one dose plus durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks [Q4W]), durvalumab (1500 mg Q4W) or sorafenib (400 mg twice daily). Data-cut off was 23 January 2023 (STRIDE OS data maturity, 78%). OS and serious treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were assessed. In addition, baseline demographics and disease characteristics were assessed in long-term survivors (LTS; participants surviving ≥36 months beyond randomization). Results: Follow-up duration was approximately 4 years across treatment arms (Table). The OS HR versus sorafenib (0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.92) and estimated 36-month OS rate (30.7%) for STRIDE were consistent with the primary analysis. The 48-month OS rate remained higher for STRIDE (25.2%) versus sorafenib (15.1%). No new serious TRAEs occurred after the primary analysis for STRIDE (17.5%). Durvalumab OS noninferiority to sorafenib and safety was consistent with the primary analysis. Baseline demographics, clinical characteristics and subsequent therapies, including tremelimumab rechallenge, for LTS in the STRIDE arm were generally consistent with the full analysis set, suggesting that LTS were not from any particular subgroup. Conclusions: These data reinforce the sustained, long-term OS benefit of STRIDE versus sorafenib in a diverse uHCC population, demonstrating unprecedented 3- and 4-year OS rates and longest follow-up to date in phase 3 uHCC studies.

Here, we assessed TILs using artificial intelligence (AI)-powered spatial analysis in advanced BTC treated with anti- PD-1 beyond 1st line treatment. Methods: An AI-powered wholeslide image (WSI) analyzer (Lunit SCOPE IO, Lunit, Seoul, Korea) was used to segment tumor epithelium and stroma, and identification of intratumor TIL (iTIL) and stromal TIL (sTIL). H&Estained WSI from pre-treatment samples was acquired from Asan Medical Center (n = 166), and a total of 154 samples (92.8%) after quality control were used for the final analysis. Immune phenotypes (IP) were defined as follows: inflamed as high iTIL and sTIL; immune-excluded as low iTIL and high sTIL; immune-desert as low TIL overall. Among them, 20 patients were available for multicolor flow cytometry analysis (FACS) using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, collected at baseline, C1D8, and C2D1. Results: All patients (n=154) were treated with anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) monotherapy, and 72 of 154 patients (46.8%) were treated as 2nd line. Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GemCis) was used prior to anti-PD-1 as first-line therapy in all patients. Overall, 15 (9.7%) patients showed inflamed IP. With median follow-up duration of 15.4 months, the inflamed IP group showed better overall survival (17.2 vs. 6.6 months, P=0.03), and progression-free survival (PFS; 4.5 vs. 2.6 months, P = 0.09) along with higher PFS rate at 12 months (33.3% vs. 11.5%, P = 0.035), and overall response rate (26.7% vs. 8.6%, P=0.053) than other phenotype groups.

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2023","2023","12",,"S21",,"1 Dec 2023","The therapeutic management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has traditionally varied based on evidence-based practice guidelines, with locoregional therapy being the preferred treatment option for unresectable early to intermediate stages HCC and systemic therapy being recommended for advanced HCC. The integration of systemic and locoregional therapy in HCC has undergone a paradigm shift with innovative systemic therapies like atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab. These therapies promise enhanced survival rates and decreased adverse event profiles, potentially revolutionizing traditional treatment methodologies. Current recommendations suggest systemic therapy for patients needing repeated locoregional interventions, even in cases of localized HCC and those unresponsive to recurrent locoregional treatment. However, the arrival of effective and less-toxic immunotherapeutic agents is anticipated to redefine these recommendations regarding indications and administration timing. The emergence of immunotherapies for HCC influences the choice of first-line treatment and necessitates a reassessment of secondary or subsequent treatments for patients responsive to immunotherapies. The treatment strategy requires careful consideration, weighing the benefits of applying locoregional treatment post-immunotherapy or combining systemic and locoregional immunotherapy. Despite the absence of studies comparing the first-line treatment of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab with locoregional therapy, there is an ongoing phase 3 Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) investigating transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with immunotherapy. Although past phase 3 RCTs of combination therapy with TACE and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as sorafenib and brivanib) have been unsuccessful for advanced HCC, there is renewed hope for the amalgamation of TACE, TARE or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and immunotherapy. While current immunotherapeutic agents have improved overall survival and progression-free survival rates compared to the past, they still fall short compared to outcomes from other cancers. In the absence of definitive biomarkers, it is posited that a combination or sequential approach incorporating locoregional treatments is crucial for enhancing the treatment outcomes in HCC patients.",,,,L643276869,10.1159/000531751

Lenvatinib plus a PD-1 inhibitor has shown promising antitumour activity and tolerable safety in patients with unresectable HCC in Asian populations. Radiotherapy has also demonstrated high response rates and favorable survival for HCC patients with PVTT. This study aimed to explore the preliminary clinical efficacy and safety of lenvatinib plus a PD-1 inhibitor combined with radiotherapy for HCC patients with main portal vein tumour thrombus.

The efficacy was evaluated by the survival and PVTT response rate, and the safety was evaluated by the frequency of key adverse events (AEs). Results: In total, 39 eligible HCC patients with type Vp-4 PVTT who received triple therapy were included in this study. The 2-year OS rate was 15.4%, which was the primary end-point of our study. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 9.4 months (range 2.3 to 57.1) and 4.9 months (range 1.4 to 36.1), respectively. The objective response rate (ORR) of PVTT based on mRECIST was 61.5%. AFP dropped to normal 3 months after radiotherapy and was an independent risk factor associated with OS.

The pivotal phase 3 HOPE-B clinical trial (NCT03569891) of etranacogene dezaparvovec demonstrated superiority of bleeding protection compared to standard of care FIX prophylaxis up to 24 months post-treatment; long-term follow-up from Year 2 post-administration onward is currently ongoing. Aim: To report long-term efficacy and safety data of etranacogene dezaparvovec from the HOPE-B trial over a period of 3 years post-treatment. Methods: In this pivotal phase 3 open-label, single-arm trial, adult male participants with severe or moderately severe hemophilia B (FIX ≤2%), with or without preexisting AAV5 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), were infused with a single dose (2×10 (13) gc/kg) of etranacogene dezaparvovec, following a ≥6-month lead-in period of receiving their usual FIX prophylaxis. Efficacy (bleeding rates, aPTT-based FIX activity levels, FIX consumption) and safety data (adverse events [AEs]) during Years 1, 2, and 3 post-treatment with etranacogene dezaparvovec are reported. Results: Of 54 participants who received etranacogene dezaparvovec, 52 completed 36 months of follow-up. Mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) for all bleeds during Months 7-36 post-treatment was significantly reduced by 64% (mean ABR 1.52) compared with the ≥6-month lead-in period (mean ABR 4.17; P=0.0004). Total number of bleeds (all types) were 136 during the ≥6-month lead-in period and decreased to 55 during Year 1, 48 during Year 2, and 37 during Year 3 post-treatment. Median [range] bleeds per participant decreased from 2.0 [0-10] during the lead-in period and remained stable to 0.0 [0-4] during Year 1, 0.0 [0-10] during Year 2, and 0.0 [0-8] during Year 3. Superior bleeding protection was in line with the level of transgene-derived endogenous FIX expression. The mean±SD (median; range) endogenous FIX activity level (ie. in the absence of exogenous FIX exposure) of participants was 41.5 IU/dL ±21.7 (39.9; 5.9-113, n=50) at Year 1, 36.7 IU/dL ±19.0 (33.9; 4.7-99.2, n=50) at Year 2, and sustained at 38.6 IU/dL ±17.8 (36.0; 4.8-80.3, n=48) at Year 3 post-treatment. Pharmacodynamic profile was not significantly different in participants with AA5 NAb undetected or titer ≤1:678. At 3 years post-treatment, 51 (94%) remained free of continuous FIX prophylaxis. One participant who lacked efficacy (highest AAV5 NAbs titer of 1:3212) and 1 who received a 10% partial dose of treatment did not discontinue prophylaxis; 1 participant eventually had his FIX levels declined to 2-5% range; his bleeding phenotype returned, and he resumed prophylaxis per protocol at month 30 post-treatment. During Year 2 and Year 3 post-treatment, 37 (70%) and 39 (75%) participants received no FIX infusion, respectively. Overall mean annualized FIX consumption decreased by 96% over 3 years post-treatment compared to the ≥6-month lead-in period (-246,763 IU/kg/participant, including those receiving FIX prophylaxis post-treatment; P<0.0001). During the 3 years post-dose, all participants experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent AE (TEAE); of 709 events, 541 (76%) were mild, 137 (19%) were moderate, and 31 (4%) were severe. There were no serious AEs related to treatment [a serious AE of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and a death were reported previously before Year 2 and determined to be unrelated to treatment]. A total of 38/54 (70%) participants experienced 96 treatment-related TEAEs, of which 95% occurred before 6 months post-treatment. The most common AE was an increase in alanine transaminase (ALT), for which 9 (16.7%) participants received supportive care with reactive corticosteroids for a mean duration of 81.4 days (SD: 28.6; range: 51-130 days). No new deaths, no new HCC, and no late treatment-related ALT elevations or thromboembolic events were reported. Conclusion: Long-term follow-up during the HOPE-B trial has shown that a single-dose of etranacogene dezaparvovec resulted in long-term endogenous FIX Padua expression and superior bleeding protection compared to FIX prophylaxis in participants without or with AAV NAb titer ≤1:678, with a favorable safety profile over 3 years post-administration.",,,,L2028732965,10.1182/blood-2023-187624

Date of Publication: 28 Nov 2023","2023","142",,"3833",,"28 Nov 2023","Background: Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare, chronic, autoimmune hemolytic anemia mediated by the classical complement pathway (CP).Sutimlimab is a first-in-class, humanized, monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits C1s of the C1 complex, preventing CP activation and CP-mediated hemolysis. CARDINAL (NCT03347396) was an open-label, single-arm, Phase 3 study of sutimlimab in patients with CAD and recent history of transfusion; CADENZA (NCT03347422) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study of sutimlimab in patients with CAD and no recent history of transfusion. Both studies had a 26-week treatment period (Part A) followed by a long-term extension (Part B), reporting data up to 2 years after the last patient finished Part A of CARDINAL and up to 1 year after the last patient finished Part A of CADENZA. With long-term treatment in both studies, sutimlimab demonstrated sustained efficacy with improvements in hemolysis and anemia, sustained clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life, and it had a favorable safety profile. Aims: To report combined safety data from Part A and B of the Phase 3 CARDINAL and CADENZA studies in sutimlimab-treated patients with CAD. Methods: In CARDINAL Part A, patients received sutimlimab on Days 0 & 7, then biweekly until the end of Part B. In CADENZA Part A, patients received sutimlimab or placebo on Days 0 & 7, then biweekly; in Part B, patients continued to receive biweekly sutimlimab or switched from placebo to receive sutimlimab on Days 0 & 7, then biweekly. Data fromall enrolled patients who received at least 1 dose of sutimlimab in CARDINAL (N=24) and CADENZA (N=42), including a post-treatment follow-up 9 weeks after the last dose, were combined into the Safety Analysis Set. Endpoints for this analysis included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs), and adverse events of special interest (AESIs). AESIs were selected based on a list of important identified risks and important potential risks for sutimlimab. Results: The Safety Analysis Set included 66 patients. At baseline, the median age was 69.5 years (range 46-88) and the majority (72.7%) were female, with a median duration since CAD diagnosis of 5.7 years (range 0-33). The median patient follow-up was 129.1 weeks (range 5-175). Sixty-four (97.0%) patients experienced ≥1 TEAE ( Table 1). Eighty-six TEAEs assessed as related to sutimlimab by the investigator occurred in 30 (45.5%) patients. Fifty-three TESAEs were reported in 22 (33.3%) patients. Three (4.6%) patients each experienced one TESAE assessed as related or possibly related to sutimlimab by the investigator (related vitreous hemorrhage, related viral infection, and possibly related severe cerebral venous thrombosis). Seven patients discontinued sutimlimab treatment and/or the studies due to ≥1 TEAE, 4 in CARDINAL and 3 in CADENZA. Four patients died during the studies: 1 in CADENZA with a TESAE of lung squamous cell carcinoma and sutimlimab was withdrawn due to this TESAE prior to the patient's death; 3 in CARDINAL, 1 patient died after premature discontinuation of sutimlimab due to AEs (fatal infection of Klebsiella pneumoniae, acrocyanosis), 1 patient died due to a newly diagnosed hepatic cancer in the first month of the study, and 1 patient died due to exacerbation of CAD during the 9-week washout period approximately 1.5 months after the last dose of sutimlimab. No deaths were assessed as related to sutimlimab by the investigator. Treatment-emergent AESIs (selected based on a list of important identified risks and important potential risks for sutimlimab) are presented in Table 1. Fourteen TEAEs of serious infection were reported in 9 patients (13.6%; one assessed as related to sutimlimab by the investigator), 31 TEAEs of hypertension were reported in 17 patients (25.8%), 28 TEAEs of acrocyanosis and/or Raynaud's phenomenon were reported in 13 patients (19.7%), and 4 TEAEs of thromboembolic events were reported in 4 patients (6.1%). No TEAEs of serious hypersensitivity reaction and/or anaphylaxis, meningococcal infection or development of systemic lupus erythematosus were reported. Conclusion: The combined safety analysis of the Phase 3 CARDINAL and CADENZA studies (Part A and B) demonstrated that sutimlimab was generally well tolerated, with the type and frequency of TEAE consistent with an older and medically complex population.",,,,L2028733700,10.1182/blood-2023-188686

This study assessed the efficacy and safety of preoperative lenvatinib therapy for patients with oncologically or technically unresectable HCC. Methods: In this multicenter single-arm phase II trial, patients with advanced HCC and factors suggestive of a poor prognosis (macroscopic vascular invasion, extrahepatic metastasis, or multinodular tumors) were enrolled. Patients with these factors, even with technically resectable HCC, were defined as oncologically unresectable because of the expected poor prognosis after surgery. After 8 weeks of lenvatinib therapy, the patients were assessed for resectability, and tumor resection was performed if the tumor was considered technically resectable. The primary endpoint was the surgical resection rate. The secondary endpoints were the macroscopic curative resection rate, overall survival (OS), ORR, PFS, and the change in the indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min as measured before and after lenvatinib therapy. The trial was registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (s031190057). Results: Between July 2019 and January 2021, 49 patients (42 oncologically unresectable patients and 7 technically unresectable patients) from 11 centers were enrolled. The ORR was 37.5% based on mRECIST and 12.5% based on RECIST version 1.1. Thirty-three patients underwent surgery (surgical resection rate: 67.3%) without perioperative mortality. The surgical resection rate was 76.2% for oncologically unresectable patients and 14.3% for technically unresectable patients. The 1-year OS rate and median PFS were 75.9% and 7.2 months, respectively, with a median follow-up period of 9.3 months. Conclusions: The relatively high surgical resection rate seen in this study suggests the safety and feasibility of lenvatinib therapy followed by surgical resection for patients with oncologically or technically unresectable HCC.",,,,L2032491880,10.1159/000535514

We aimed to assess the efficacy of adjuvant atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus active surveillance in patients with high-risk hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: In the global, open-label, phase 3 IMbrave050 study, adult patients with high-risk surgically resected or ablated hepatocellular carcinoma were recruited from 134 hospitals and medical centres in 26 countries in four WHO regions (European region, region of the Americas, South-East Asia region, and Western Pacific region). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio via an interactive voice–web response system using permuted blocks, using a block size of 4, to receive intravenous 1200 mg atezolizumab plus 15 mg/kg bevacizumab every 3 weeks for 17 cycles (12 months) or to active surveillance. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival by independent review facility assessment in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04102098. Findings: The intention-to-treat population included 668 patients randomly assigned between Dec 31, 2019, and Nov 25, 2021, to either atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (n=334) or to active surveillance (n=334). At the prespecified interim analysis (Oct 21, 2022), median duration of follow-up was 17·4 months (IQR 13·9–22·1). Adjuvant atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was associated with significantly improved recurrence-free survival (median, not evaluable [NE]; [95% CI 22·1–NE]) compared with active surveillance (median, NE [21·4–NE]; hazard ratio, 0·72 [adjusted 95% CI 0·53–0·98]; p=0·012). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 136 (41%) of 332 patients who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and 44 (13%) of 330 patients in the active surveillance group. Grade 5 adverse events occurred in six patients (2%, two of which were treatment related) in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group, and one patient (<1%) in the active surveillance group. Both atezolizumab and bevacizumab were discontinued because of adverse events in 29 patients (9%) who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Interpretation: Among patients at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence following curative-intent resection or ablation, recurrence-free survival was improved in those who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus active surveillance. To our knowledge, IMbrave050 is the first phase 3 study of adjuvant treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma to report positive results. However, longer follow-up for both recurrence-free and overall survival is needed to assess the benefit–risk profile more fully.

The current analysis evaluated the population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) of tremelimumab and durvalumab, and the exposure–response (ER) relationship for efficacy and safety of STRIDE in patients with uHCC. Previous PopPK models for tremelimumab and durvalumab were updated using data from previous studies in various cancers combined with data from Study 22 and HIMALAYA. Typical population mean parameters and associated inter- and intra-individual variability were assessed, as was the influence of covariates. Individual exposure metrics were derived from the individual empirical Bayes estimates as drivers for ER analysis related to efficacy and safety from HIMALAYA. The observed pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab in uHCC were well described by a 2-compartment model with both linear and time-dependent clearance. All identified covariates changed tremelimumab PK parameters by <25%, and thus had minimal clinical relevance; similar results were obtained from durvalumab PopPK analysis. None of tremelimumab or durvalumab exposure metrics were significantly associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), or adverse events. Baseline aspartate aminotransferase and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were associated with OS (P <.001) by the Cox proportional hazards model.

Semiannual surveillance of the disease for patients with cirrhosis or hepatitis B virus allows for early detection with more favorable outcomes. The current underuse of surveillance programs demonstrates the need for intervention at both the patient and provider level. Mail outreach along with navigation provision has proven to increase surveillance follow-up in patients, while provider-targeted electronic medical record reminders and compliance reports have increased provider awareness of HCC surveillance. Imaging is the primary mode of diagnosis in HCC with The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) being a widely accepted comprehensive system that standardizes the reporting and data collection for HCC. The management of HCC is complex and requires multidisciplinary team evaluation of each patient based on their preference, the state of the disease, and the available medical and surgical interventions. Staging systems are useful in determining the appropriate intervention for HCC. Early-stage HCC is best managed by curative treatment modalities, such as liver resection, transplant, or ablation. For intermediate stages of the disease, transarterial local regional therapies can be applied. Advanced stages of the disease are treated with systemic therapies, for which there have been recent advances with new drug combinations. Previously sorafenib was the mainstay systemic treatment, but the recent introduction of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab proves to have a greater impact on overall survival. Although there is a current lack of improved outcomes in Phase III trials, neoadjuvant therapies are a potential avenue for HCC management in the future.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03383458, NCT03867084)",,,L2026541229,10.3390/cancers15215118

Only one third of patients achieve an objective response with ICI-based therapies due to primary resistance or acquired resistance. The liver tumor microenvironment is naturally immunosuppressive, and specific mutations in cell signaling pathways allow the tumor to evade the immune response. Next, gene sequencing of the tumor tissue or circulating tumor DNA may delineate resistance mechanisms to ICI-based therapy and provide a rationale for novel combination therapies.

The present study aims to evaluate the feasibility of TARE in combination with Atezo/Bev for the treatment of intermediate and advanced staged HCC. Methods: A retrospective review at a single institution was performed between May 2021 and December 2022. Patients who received TARE using yttrium-90 (Y90) with concomitant or sequential Atezo/Bev systemic treatment were included. The following outcomes were retrieved: overall survival (OS), radiologic tumor response, progression-free survival, technical adverse events related to TARE, and toxicity based on the National Cancer Institute–Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Results: Ten consecutive patients with intermediate (n ​= ​4) and advanced stage HCC (n ​= ​6) were treated with TARE and sequential/concomitant Atezo/Bev. Tumor control was achieved in all TARE-treated target lesions (100%). Overall disease progression occurred in 4 patients with PFS of 78.8% and 66.7% at 6- and 12- months, respectively. Two patients died at follow-up, with 6-month and 12-month OS rates of 90.0% and 77.1%, respectively. Three (75%) patients with intermediate stage disease were downstaged into Milan criteria. One patient developed grade 3 transaminitis and hypoglobulinemia, while Atezo/Bev was switched to Lenvatinib in another patient due to immunotherapy related myositis. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the initial safety and feasibility of combined TARE with Atezo/Bev for intermediate/advanced stage HCC. Further prospective studies with larger sample sizes are warranted.",,,,L2027356746,10.1016/j.jimed.2023.09.002

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2023","2023","18","11","S211",,"1 Nov 2023","Introduction: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are electric fields that disrupt cellular processes critical for cancer cell viability and tumor progression, ultimately leading to cell death. TTFields therapy is approved in several territories for treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) and unresectable pleural mesothelioma. The efficacy of TTFields therapy concomitant with standard of care was recently demonstrated in metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and a phase 3 study in ovarian cancer is nearing completion. TTFields therapy extends life, however in most cases there will eventually be disease progression. The current study aimed to identify mechanisms leading cancer cells to experience reduced sensitivity to TTFields over time, to develop strategies to maintain responsiveness. Methods: Cells from different cancer types - H1299 NSCLC cells, A2780 ovarian cancer cells, and U-87 MG GBM cells - were treated with TTFields (at frequencies of 200, 150, and 200 kHz, respectively) for 3 days, followed by analysis of changes in signaling pathways by Luminex multiplex assay and Western blot. Tumor sections from mice bearing LL/2 lung or MOSE-L ovarian tumors and from rats bearing N1S1 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors, treated with TTFields or sham, were examined by immunohistochemistry. Survival assays were performed on cells treated with TTFields for 6 days with concomitant relevant inhibitors during the first 3 days of treatment. Efficacy for 10 days of concomitant treatment with TTFields and a potential inhibitor was tested in an orthotopic ovarian cancer mouse model, and tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence imaging. Results: Cells exposed to TTFields for 3 days demonstrated upregulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Significantly increased phosphorylation of AKT and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) were evident as early as 2 hour following treatment initiation, an effect completely abrogated using FAK or ROCK inhibition. Increased AKT phosphorylation was also seen in tumor sections from animals treated with TTFields across the various indications. Concomitant treatment with the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib sensitized the cells to TTFields and enhanced treatment efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is involved in reduced sensitivity of cancer cells to TTFields treatment, and PI3K inhibition may allow sensitization to TTFields.

"Evolving landscape of systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma","Kelley R.K.","Annals of Oncology (2023) 34 Supplement 3 (S1377). Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2023","2023","34",,"S1377",,"1 Nov 2023","This session will present an overview of the rapidly expanding landscape of systemic therapy options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In 2007, sorafenib was established as the first systemic therapy with a meaningful survival benefit in advanced HCC, with median overall survival of 10.7 months for sorafenib compared to 7.9 months for placebo. For the next ten years, sorafenib remained the only systemic therapy with survival benefit in HCC. Starting in 2017, multiple new agents and combinations have demonstrated efficacy in advanced HCC, including multikinase inhibitors with varying target profiles and higher anti-angiogenic potency, as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors alone and in combination. In 2023, there are now six agents or combination regimens which have shown survival improvement or noninferiority versus sorafenib in the first-line setting in global randomized studies, including lenvatinib, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, durvalumab plus single-dose tremelimumab, camrelizumab plus rivoceranib, and both durvalumab and tislelizumab. After progression on first-line sorafenib, the multikinase inhibitors, regorafenib and cabozantinib, and the anti-VEGFR2 mAb, ramucirumab, have improved survival versus placebo. Beyond anti-angiogenic therapies, the immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, also demonstrated survival improvement in a study of Asian patients with advanced HCC after progression on sorafenib. With the advances in therapeutic regimens along with refinements in clinical trial design and supportive care, the median overall survival on first-line therapy has improved substantially, now exceeding 19 months in contemporary trials. Progress in the advanced stages of disease has prompted a new generation of clinical trials in earlier stages of HCC. In this session, the mechanisms of action of individual agents and combinations will be reviewed, along with key details of study populations and trial designs and a selection of new studies on horizon.",,,,L2028450249,10.1016/j.annonc.2023.09.100

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2023","2023","34",,"S1553","S1554","1 Nov 2023","Background: The combination of atezolizumab (Atezo) and bevacizumab (Bev) is recommended as a first-line treatment for unresectable HCC (uHCC) in the Japanese guidelines for liver cancer treatment, as well as in the guidelines of the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Group and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, based on the results of the IMbrave150 trial. In the subgroup analysis of the IMbrave150 trial, patients with stable disease (SD), accounting for approximately 40% of the total population, had statistically significantly shorter overall survival (OS) compared to patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (SD: median 17.1 months, CR+PR: median not reached, P<0.0001). Prolonging the prognosis of the SD group is one of the unmet medical needs for uHCC. On the other hand, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) could achieve a high local effect and control intrahepatic lesions. In addition, TACE has been reported to activate anti-tumor immunity and therefore, might synergistically enhance the efficacy of Atezo plus Bev. Trial design: This is a multicenter, phase III study of patients with uHCC who have BCLC-B stage (including a single tumor with a diameter ≥5 cm) or BCLC-C stage (excluding Vp3 or 4) and Child-Pugh A liver function. Cohorts will be divided based on imaging evaluation at 12 weeks after Atezo plus Bev treatment. Patients with SD (RECIST ver.1.1) will be randomized (randomized cohort) to receive Atezo plus Bev with or without TACE (1:1 allocation) to investigate its contribution to extending OS (primary endpoint). In addition, patients with CR or PR based on imaging evaluation at 12 weeks after Atezo plus Bev treatment (ABC-conversion cohort) will be prospectively followed to evaluate the conversion rate (primary endpoint) and the prognosis of patients who receive conversion therapy.

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2023","2023","34",,"S1531","S1532","1 Nov 2023","Background: Atezo + Bev has been approved as first-line treatment in pts with uHCC based on a global phase 3 study (IMbrave 150). However, real-world data is lacking worldwide. Thus, we conducted the ELIXIR study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Atezo + Bev prospectively in real-world Japanese pts. Here, we report the safety assessment and preliminary efficacy results in 493 pts out of 510 pts. Methods: In this prospective, multicenter, observational study, 510 systemic treatment-naïve pts with uHCC and Child-Pugh A received Atezo 1200 mg IV q3w + Bev 15 mg/kg IV q3w. The primary endpoint was adverse events of special interest (AESI). Efficacy outcomes were also assessed, including progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR). Results: A total of 510 pts were enrolled between Apr 2021 and Feb 2022. 493 pts were analyzed and the median follow-up time was 14.5 mo (95% CI, 13.8, 15.0). A total of 240 (48.7%) AESIs and 149 (30.2%) Grade ≥3 AESIs were observed (Table). Median PFS was 8.1 mo (95% CI, 7.4, 9.5) per RECIST 1.1 and 8.3 mo (95% CI, 7.5, 9.7) per modified RECIST (mRECIST). ORR was 28.6% (95% CI, 24.6, 32.8) per RECIST 1.1 and 36.5% (95% CI, 32.3, 40.9) per mRECIST. [Formula presented] Conclusions: In this analysis, as previously reported, additional safety signals were not observed in Japanese pts. The efficacy seen in ELIXIR was consistent with that of IMbrave150, and Atezo+Bev could be a standard first-line therapy for Japanese uHCC pts in the real world.

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2023","2023","34",,"S1530","S1531","1 Nov 2023","Background: In the primary analysis (data cut-off [DCO]: 27 August 2021) of the phase 3 HIMALAYA study (NCT03298451) in uHCC, STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab) significantly improved OS vs sorafenib; durvalumab was noninferior to sorafenib (Abou-Alfa et al. NEJM Evid 2022). Here, we report an updated 4-year OS analysis of HIMALAYA. Methods: Participants with uHCC and no previous systemic treatment were randomised to STRIDE (tremelimumab 300 mg for one dose plus durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks [Q4W]), durvalumab (1500 mg Q4W) or sorafenib (400 mg twice daily). DCO was 23 January 2023 (STRIDE OS data maturity, 78%). OS and serious treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were assessed. In addition, baseline demographics and disease characteristics were assessed in long-term survivors (LTS; surviving ≥36 months beyond randomisation). Results: Follow-up duration was approximately 4 years across arms (Table). The OS HR vs sorafenib and estimated 36-month OS rate for STRIDE were consistent with the primary analysis. The 48-month OS rate remained higher for STRIDE (25.2%) vs sorafenib (15.1%). No new serious TRAEs occurred after the primary analysis for STRIDE. Durvalumab OS noninferiority to sorafenib and safety was consistent with the primary analysis. Baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, subsequent therapies and tremelimumab rechallenge for LTS in the STRIDE arm were generally consistent with the full analysis set, suggesting that LTS were not from any particular subgroup. Conclusions: These data reinforce the sustained, long-term OS benefit of STRIDE vs sorafenib in a diverse uHCC population, demonstrating unprecedented 3- and 4-year OS rates and longest follow-up to date in phase 3 uHCC studies. STRIDE maintained a tolerable safety profile, with no new serious safety events. This abstract was originally presented at the 2023 World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer.

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2023","2023","34",,"S1554",,"1 Nov 2023","Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer and is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage. In the phase 3 HIMALAYA study (NCT03298451) in unresectable HCC (uHCC), the STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab) regimen improved overall survival (OS) versus sorafenib, with a manageable safety profile. HIMALAYA enrolled participants with uHCC not eligible for embolisation with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B or C, Child-Pugh (CP) class A, WHO/ECOG PS of 0-1 and no main trunk portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Based on the positive results of HIMALAYA, the aim of SIERRA is to assess the safety and efficacy of STRIDE in a broader uHCC population, including inferior hepatic function, poorer performance status or more advanced disease. Trial design: SIERRA (NCT05883644) is a phase 3b, single-arm, multicentre study. This study will enroll approximately 140 adults with uHCC, BCLC stage B or C, and one of the following: CP class of B7 or B8 with WHO/ECOG PS of 0-1, without main trunk PVT; CP class A with WHO/ECOG PS of 2, without main trunk PVT; CP class A with WHO/ECOG PS of 0-1 with evidence of chronic main trunk PVT. Participants must not have received prior systemic therapy for HCC and must not be eligible for locoregional therapy. Key exclusion criteria include evidence of acute main trunk PVT. All participants will receive STRIDE: one single priming dose of 300 mg tremelimumab plus 1500 mg durvalumab at Day 1 (Week 0), followed by durvalumab 1500 mg monotherapy Q4W starting at Week 4 and continuing until clinical progression, confirmed radiological progression (RECIST 1.1), unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or any discontinuation criteria are met. The co-primary endpoints are the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 adverse events possibly related to study intervention within 6 months after initiation of STRIDE and investigator-assessed (RECIST 1.1) objective response rate. Secondary endpoints include OS, progression-free survival, duration of response and health-related quality of life.

However, there is no globally established subsequent treatment after failure on first-line Atezo-Bev. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of second-line regorafenib in uHCC pts who progressed on first-line Atezo-Bev. Methods: This is a phase II investigator-initiated trial involving 2 academic centers in Korea. Key eligibility criteria include confirmed diagnosis of HCC; prior treatment with Atezo-Bev at least ≥ 2 cycles; Child-Pugh A; ECOG performance status 0-1. Eligible patients received regorafenib 160 mg once daily 3 weeks on/1 week off until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) according to the RECIST v1.1, overall survival (OS) and treatment-related adverse event (TRAE). Results: Total 40 pts were recruited from Dec 2021 to May 2023. Pts characteristics were as follows: median age of 56 years (range, 36-81); hepatitis B (77.5%), hepatitis C (10.0%), non-viral (12.5%); BCLC C stage (97.5%); and AFP ≥ 400 ng/ml (40.0%). As of the date of data cut-off (15 Aug 2023), the median follow-up duration was 6.6 mo (95% CI, 5.0-8.2). The median PFS was 3.5 mo (95% CI, 3.0-4.0). ORR and DCR were 10.0% and 82.5%. The median OS was 9.7 mo (95% CI, 8.3-11.1) and 6-month OS rate was 55.0%. The median OS since the start of prior Atezo-Bev was 16.6 mo (95% CI, 11.9-21.3). When stratified according to the duration of prior Atezo-Bev (<4 cycles [n=10] vs. ≥4 cycles [n=30]), pts with ≥4 cycles of prior Atezo-Bev showed better median OS (not reached vs 3.6 mo; p=0.001) and ORR (13.3% vs 0%; p=0.009), while there was a trend for better median PFS (3.8 mo vs 2.5 mo; p=0.107). The most common grade 3-4 TRAEs were thrombocytopenia (5.0%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (2.5%), and fatigue (2.5%). Conclusions: Regorafenib was effective as second-line therapy in uHCC pts who progressed on first-line Atezo-Bev. Efficacy and safety outcomes from our study were consistent with those observed in the pivotal phase 3 RESORCE trial which required sorafenib-tolerated/progressed pts.

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2023","2023","18",,,,"1 Nov 2023","Icaritin is a prenylflavonoid derivative obtained from Epimedium genus that has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. It has been demonstrated to exert pleiotropic pharmacological and biological activities including anti-inflammation and tumor inhibition. Based on its therapeutic effects in cancer inhibition, Icaritin had entered clinical trials for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In phase III adaptive trial, randomized, double-blinded, multicenter study of Icaritin versus Huachansu was performed since September 2017, in which a composite biomarker score (CBS) consisting of AFP, TNF and IFNγ was used for patient stratification. In total, 543 participants were screened, and 283 patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the Icaritin and Huachansu treatment groups. The interim analysis of 71 CBS-positive patients demonstrated a median overall survival of 13.54 months (95% CI, 7.36-20.07, n=33) versus 6.87 months (95% CI, 4.93-11.43, n=38) Icaritin and Huachansu groups (HR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.82, p = 0.0092). Grade ≥reatment- related adverse events (TRAEs) including elevation in serum γ-glutamyltransferase (2.8%) were observed in 12.1% of Icaritintreated patients (n=141), and TRAEs including diarrhea (7.1%) were observed in 26.2% of Huachansu-treated patients (n=141). QOL were 7.3 months vs. 2.7 months observed in patients with Icaritin and control treatments. We previously reported that Icaritin inhibited IL-6 signaling pathway. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms of tumor inhibition, multiple approaches had been applied in more studies. We obtained evidence that Icaritin directly interacts with MyD88 and IKK proteins, indicating Icaritin interferes with both MyD88 pathway and NF-κB pathway. Since MyD88 and NF-κB are both involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, we examined Icarritin's impact on tumor immune environment. We proposed that immune modulation mechanisms underlie Icaritin's tumor inhibition effect..",,,,L643026046,10.1186/s13020-023-00828-3

IMbrave050 is evaluating adjuvant atezolizumab+bevacizumab for delaying or preventing recurrence in patients with high-risk HCC. Methods: IMbrave050 (NCT04102098) enrolled patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence after resection or ablation. Patients were randomized to Arm A (atezolizumab+bevacizumab) or Arm B (active surveillance). Stratification factors included geographic region, high-risk features, curative procedure, and optional adjuvant TACE. Arm A received atezolizumab 1200mg + bevacizumab 15mg/kg IV q3w for 1 year or 17 cycles. Arm B underwent active surveillance for 1 year and could crossover to atezolizumab+bevacizumab after recurrence confirmation. The primary endpoint was independent review facility (IRF)-assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS). Results: Baseline demographics were balanced between arms (ITT population: n=668). At interim analysis (median follow-up: 17.4 mo; cut-off date: Oct 21, 2022), the primary endpoint was met with an IRF-RFS HR of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.56, 0.93; p = 0.0120). Atezolizumab+ bevacizumab safety was consistent with the well-established safety profile of each therapeutic agent and with the underlying disease. Conclusion: Atezolizumab+bevacizumab is the first adjuvant regimen to demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in RFS vs active surveillance in patients at high risk of disease recurrence after resection or ablation. The benefit:risk profile of atezolizumab+bevacizumab favors the use of this regimen as adjuvant therapy with potential to set a new standard of care in adjuvant HCC.",,,,L643051054,10.1097/XCS.0000000000000865

Methods We conducted a single-center, retrospective study of HCC patients who received either ATE/BEV (n=79) or LENV (n = 49), between February 2019 and December 2022 from CHA Bundang Medical Center. We analyzed progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in relation to the baseline patient characteristics. Results Median age was 62 years, with male predominance (87.4%). Mean OS time was significantly longer in ATE/BEV group (23.6 vs 21.7months; p<0.001). Median OS time in LENV group was 16 months (95% CI, 7.5-24.4), and ATE/BEV group have not yet reached the median OS. Patients with Child-Pugh A had better OS than those with Child-Pugh B (32.6 vs 17.2months, p<0.001). Also, patients with ALBI grade I had better OS than those with ALBI grade 2/3 (32.0 vs 25.2, p=0.11). Meanwhile, lower baseline AFP or PIVKAII were associated with longer OS. In multivariate analysis by Cox hazards model, treatment regimen was the only independent prognostic factor associated with OS. Also, the patients with viral hepatitis did not show better outcome when compared with those without viral hepatitis in both groups. Lastly, the proportion of the patients with worsening liver function, whose ALBI or MELD scores increased 3 months after treatment, was not different in both groups.

"Assessing surrogacy using restricted mean survival time ratio for overall survival in liver cancer: a narrative review","Leung T.H., Ho J.C., Wang X., Pang H.","Chinese Clinical Oncology (2023) 12:5 Article Number: 53. Date of Publication: 31 Oct 2023","2023","12","5",,,"31 Oct 2023","Background and Objective: The application of immunotherapy in cancers, including liver cancer, has been increasing. However, non-proportional hazard (NPH) is often observed in cancer immunotherapy trials. In presence of violation of proportional hazard (PH) assumption, restricted mean survival time (RMST) ratio was proposed as an alternative to hazard ratio (HR) for evaluating the treatment effects of such trials. To shorten the total study duration, an intermediate endpoint with shorter follow-up such as progression-free survival (PFS) is used as the primary endpoint. Our aim is to evaluate the applicability of RMST ratio in addition to the HR in assessing the level of PFS serving as a surrogacy of overall survival (OS). Methods: Phase II or phase III hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) immunotherapy studies that were published between January 2013 and August 2022 were identified via the search in PubMed. Weighted least-square regression (WLSR) was applied to analyze the trial level data with the sample size of study being set as the weight. The evaluation was conducted twice with RMST ratio and HR being applied in respective evaluation to examine the level of PFS as a surrogacy for OS. Key Content and Findings: Based on the results of eight included trials, the R-square values of WLSR with either HR or RMST ratio being applied were 0.31 and 0.16 separately, indicating a moderate and low correlation between PFS and OS respectively. Conclusions: In this study, our results demonstrated the potential of RMST ratio in addition to HR for evaluating the level of surrogacy in immunotherapy trials. Furthermore, including more large scale and homogeneous studies into the research may help better understand the level of surrogacy in liver cancer.",,,37817506,L2028411251,10.21037/cco-23-48

This exploratory analysis examined the prognostic impact of a baseline albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score. Methods: Patients with treatment-naïve unresectable HCC, ≥1 measurable untreated lesion, and Child-Pugh class A liver function were randomized 2:1 to receive atezolizumab 1,200 mg + bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks or sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed in the intention-To-Treat population by ALBI/modified (m)ALBI grade. Time to deterioration (TTD; defined as time to 0.5-point increase from the baseline ALBI score over 2 visits or death) of liver function and safety were investigated. Results: Of 501 enrolled patients, 336 were randomized to receive atezolizumab + bevacizumab (ALBI grade [G] 1: n = 191; G2: n = 144 [mALBI G2a: n = 72, G2b: n = 72]; missing ALBI grade: n = 1) and 165 to sorafenib (ALBI G1: n = 87; G2: n = 78 [mALBI G2a: n = 37; G2b: n = 41]). Median follow-up was 15.6 months. OS and PFS improved with atezolizumab + bevacizumab versus sorafenib in patients with ALBI G1 (OS HR: 0.50 [95% CI: 0.35, 0.72]; PFS HR: 0.61 [95% CI: 0.45, 0.82]). In patients with ALBI G2 or mALBI G2a or G2b, PFS was numerically longer with atezolizumab + bevacizumab versus sorafenib, but no OS benefit was seen. Median TTD in the intention-To-Treat population was 10.2 months (95% CI: 8.0, 11.0) with atezolizumab + bevacizumab versus 8.6 months (95% CI: 6.2, 11.8) with sorafenib (HR: 0.82 [95% CI: 0.65, 1.03]). Safety profiles of atezolizumab and bevacizumab were consistent with previous analyses, regardless of ALBI grade. Conclusion: ALBI grade appeared to be prognostic for outcomes with both atezolizumab + bevacizumab and sorafenib treatment in patients with HCC. Atezolizumab + bevacizumab preserved liver function for a numerically longer duration than sorafenib.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03434379)",,,L2028038885,10.1159/000529996

Combination therapy involving ICI has superseded sorafenib as the first-line treatment option for advanced HCC due to their superior response rates and survival benefits based on recently published phase III trials. However, the role of first-line lenvatinib remains uncertain as no prospective trials have compared its efficacy with ICI in advanced HCC. Several retrospective studies have shown that first-line lenvatinib may not be inferior to ICI combination. Indeed, a growing body of evidence suggests that ICI treatment is associated with inferior treatment outcome in non-viral HCC patients, questioning the supremacy of ICI treatment in all patients and rendering first-line lenvatinib as a potential preferred treatment option. Furthermore, in high-burden intermediate-stage HCC, accumulating evidence supports first-line lenvatinib, or in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), as a preferred treatment option over TACE alone. In this Review, we describe the latest evidence surrounding the evolving role of first-line lenvatinib in HCC.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2023","2023","29","4","945","957","1 Oct 2023","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly lethal cancer with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) has emerged as a promising treatment modality for HCC due to its unique physical and biological properties. CIRT uses carbon ions to target and destroy cancer cells with a high precision and efficacy. The Bragg Peak phenomenon allows precise dose delivery to the tumor while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. In addition, the high relative biological effectiveness of carbon ions can be shown against radioresistant and hypoxic tumor areas. CIRT also offers a shorter treatment schedule than conventional radiotherapy, which increases patient convenience and compliance. The clinical outcomes of CIRT for HCC have shown excellent local control rates with minimal side effects. Considering its physical and biological properties, CIRT may be a viable option for complex clinical scenarios such as patients with poor liver function, large tumors, re-irradiation cases, and tumors close to critical organs. Further research and larger studies are needed to establish definitive indications for CIRT and to compare its efficacy with that of other treatment modalities. Nevertheless, CIRT offers a potential breakthrough in HCC management, providing hope for improved therapeutic outcomes and reduced treatment-related toxicities.

Since its discovery, tremendous efforts have been directed toward understanding the intricate pathogenic mechanisms, discovering the complex viral replication process, the essential replicative intermediates, and cell division-mediated viral spread, which enables virion viability. The consideration of the interaction between HBV and HDV is crucial in the process of developing novel pharmaceuticals. Until just recently, interferon-based therapy was the only treatment available worldwide. This review aims to present the recent advancements in understanding the life cycle of HDV, which have consequently facilitated the development of innovative drug classes.

Due to the increase in life expectancy and the epidemiological growth of specific risk factors, such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), the incidence of HCC is growing globally, and mortality rates are still high. Moreover, patients frequently present at an intermediate or advanced tumor stage, when curative treatments, such as surgical resection, liver transplantation or ablation are no longer applicable. In these cases, trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE), trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE), and systemic therapy are the only suitable options to achieve disease control. The multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib has been the only systemic treatment available for unresectable advanced HCC for almost a decade, but in the last couple of years new therapeutic options have emerged. Recent advances in understanding the interactions between the tumor and its microenvironment, especially cancer immune escape, led to the advent of immunotherapy. Currently, first-line systemic treatment for HCC is represented by the combination of the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) Atezolizumab plus Bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody, but many other ICIs have been investigated, such as Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, Durvalumab and Ipilimumab. However, the problem of second- and third-line therapies, and the correct sequence of treatments remains open and is not addressed in most studies. This explains the urge to find new systemic treatments that can improve the survival and quality of life in patients that can go beyond the first line of treatment. The aim of this paper is to offer a complete overview of the most recent innovations in systemic treatments for unresectable locally advanced and metastatic HCC, including emerging therapies, with a particular focus on treatment sequences. Moreover, we will provide an outlook on possible future approaches to patients who progress beyond first-line therapies.",,,37887533,L2026316933,10.3390/curroncol30100633

We aimed to explore how tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) affect HCC risk in patients with CHB. Methods: The REACH-B, aMAP, and mPAGE-B models were utilized to assess HCC risk in patients with CHB from two global randomized-controlled trials evaluating the impact of TAF vs. TDF treatment. Standard incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated using data from the REACH-B model as a ratio of observed HCC cases in the TAF- or TDF-treated patients vs. predicted HCC cases for untreated historical controls. Proportions of treated patients shifting aMAP and mPAGE-B risk categories between baseline and Week 240 were calculated. Results: Of the 1,632 patients (TAF, n = 1,093; TDF, n = 539) followed for up to 300 weeks, 22 HCC cases developed. Those receiving TAF had an SIR that was lower compared to the SIR of individuals receiving TDF: 0.32 (p <0.001) vs. 0.56 (p = 0.06). In the general study population, individuals without cirrhosis at baseline had an SIR that was lower compared to the SIR of individuals with cirrhosis at baseline: 0.37 (p <0.001) vs. 0.58 (p = 0.15). Of the patients at low risk of HCC at baseline, the majority (97%) remained low risk by mPAGE-B and aMAP scoring at Week 240. Among those at medium or high risk at baseline, substantial portions shifted to a lower risk category by Week 240 (mPAGE-B: 22% and 42%; aMAP: 39% and 63%, respectively). Conclusions: This evaluation provides evidence that treatment with TAF or TDF can reduce HCC risk in patients with CHB, particularly in patients without cirrhosis. Impact and implications: Despite the substantial impact of HCC on long-term outcomes of patients with CHB, the differential risk of HCC development among those receiving treatment with TAF vs. TDF has not been well elucidated. Using three validated risk prediction models, we found that TAF is at least as effective as TDF in reducing HCC risk in patients with CHB. While TDF is well-studied in the context of HCC risk reduction, our novel findings underscore the effectiveness of TAF as a treatment option for patients with CHB.

Median overall survival (OS) in the overall cohort was 13.2 months. Pts with PLT are typically excluded from phase 3 clinical trials in HCC, including RESORCE. Here, we present the final analysis of pts with PLT in REFINE. Methods: REFINE is an international, prospective, multicenter study that enrolled pts with uHCC for whom the decision to treat with REG was made by their physician before enrollment, according to the local health authority approved label. The primary aim was safety, including incidence of TEAEs (MedDRA v25) and dose modifications due to TEAEs. Secondary endpoints included OS and duration of treatment (DoT). Results: Of the 1005 evaluable pts, 25 (2%) had PLT (median age, 60 [range 40–69] years; 60% Asian, 96% male). Most pts had ALBI grade 1 (60%), Child-Pugh A status (64%), ECOG performance status 0–1 (80%), and received prior sorafenib (92%); while none received prior immunotherapy. Furthermore, the most common HCC etiology was hepatitis B (68% vs 37% in pts with no PLT). Transarterial chemoembolization was the most common additional prior non-systemic treatment in the PLT subgroup (56%). Median DoT was numerically longer in the PLT vs non-PLT subgroup (5.5 [range 0.6–16.8] vs 3.7 [range <0.1–38.9] months). The most common TEAEs in the PLT subgroup were hand–foot skin reaction (52%), diarrhea (32%), and fatigue (24%). There were no grade 5 drug-related TEAEs in the PLT subgroup. Drug-related TEAEs leading to dose modification or permanent discontinuation were comparable in the PLT and non-PLT subgroups (44% vs 37% and 12% vs 16%, respectively). Median OS from start of REG treatment was similar in the PLT (15.8 months; 95% CI 10.1, 25.4) and non-PLT (12.8 months; 95% CI 11.4, 14.6) subgroups, and with the overall cohort. Conclusions: Final data from the REFINE study confirm the safety and effectiveness of REG in pts with uHCC and PLT, consistent with findings from the overall cohort.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2023","2023","34",,"S950","S951","1 Oct 2023","Background: Quality of life (QoL) is an increasingly important endpoint in oncology clinical trials. In the non-inferiority (NI) setting, the experimental treatment should confirm to be preferable, and patient-reported outcomes should have a relevant role. Aim of this study was to assess the inclusion of QoL among endpoints in phase III NI trials, the presence of QoL results in the publications and the impact of QoL results on the interpretation of the study. Methods: We performed a PubMed search for phase III NI trials published between 2012 and 2021, testing systemic treatments in adult patients with solid tumours. Trials were divided according to 4 NI strategies: (1) different treatments; (2) different route of administration of the same drug; (3) shorter duration of treatment; (4) omission of one or more drugs. Trials were analysed according to three endpoints: (1) proportion of publications including QoL among endpoints; (2) proportion of publications reporting QoL results; (3) proportion of publications with demonstration of NI, in which QoL results actually favour the experimental treatment. Results: 106 publications were eligible. In 47 studies (44.3%), QoL was not included among endpoints, and QoL results were not available in 66 (62.3%) primary publications. Out of 74 trials with demonstration of NI, QoL was not assessed in 36 (48.64%) and QoL results were not available in 43 primary publications (58.1%); QoL results actually favoured the experimental treatment in 19 trials (25.7%). Considering only the subgroup of 73 trials testing the NI of different treatments, 30 (41.1%) did not include QoL and QoL results were not available in 42 (57.5%) publications; within this subgroup, focusing on 55 trials with demonstration of NI, 25 (45.5%) did not include QoL; QoL results were not available in 29 (52.7%) primary publications; QoL results actually favoured the experimental treatment in 15 trials (27.3%). Conclusions: Quality of life is not assessed and/or reported in many non-inferiority trials testing cancer treatments. Among trials formally demonstrating the non-inferiority, only a minority can claim quality of life results actually favouring the experimental treatment.

Results: Of 393 pts in LASER301, 45 (23%) receiving laz and 41 (21%) receiving gef had measurable and/or non-measurable baseline (BL) CNS mets. BL characteristics were balanced between groups, with most pts having 1–3 CNS lesions (laz: 91%, gef: 83%). Median BL target lesion size was 20.0 mm (laz) and 16.0 mm (gef). Median iPFS in the laz group was 28.2 mo (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.8, 28.2) vs 8.4 mo (6.7, not reached [NR]) in the gef group (hazard ratio: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.89; P=0.02). iORR was higher for the laz (n=17, 94%) vs gef (n=11, 73%) group. At data cutoff, median iDoR in the laz group was NR (8.3, NR) vs 6.3 mo (2.8, NR) in the gef group. The median best change from BL in CNS target lesion size was -57% and -47% for laz (n=17) and gef (n=14), respectively. No new safety signals were identified from LASER301. Conclusions: In pts with BL CNS mets, laz significantly improved iPFS vs gef with more durable responses. Laz has the potential to improve CNS outcomes in NSCLC.

We compared the efficacy and safety of TACE with idarubicin versus epirubicin in HCC patients. Methods: This is a non inferiority randomized controlled trial registered in clinicaltrials.gov with NCT05053386. 186 patients was needed according to calculation. Patients with liver-confined HCC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score 0-1, Child-Pugh class A/B, and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage A-C were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive TACE with 10mg idarubicin (experimental group) or 50mg epirubicin (control group). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints were disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety. Results: 110 patients were recruited from October 2021 to April 2023 at 14 centers in China and randomly assigned to undergo TACE with idarubicin (n=55) or epirubicin (n=55). The median age was 63 years (range 35, 79), most were male (83.6%), ECOG score 0 (85.5%), Child-Pugh A (90.9%), hepatitis B (81.8%), there were no significant differences between groups in baseline characteristics (p>0.05). The experimental group has a good tumor response, as shown by higher ORR ( 66.0% vs 59.5%, p=0.530) and DCR (89.4% vs 81.0%, p=0.262) versus control group. The median PFS and median OS were not observed yet. No significant differences were found between groups in postembolization syndrome and liver toxicity (p>0.05). The incidence of thrombocytopenia was higher in control group than in experimental group (9.8% vs 25.0%, p=0.046). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events mainly included increased ALT/AST (ALT, 14.8% vs 22.2%, p=0.350; AST, 23.0% vs 19.4%, p=0.686). Conclusions: Our interim results suggest that idarubicin could be a safe and effective treatment option for lipiodol TACE of HCC. This trial will progress as planned.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2023","2023","34",,"S896","S897","1 Oct 2023","Background: The phase III NAPOLI 3 trial (NCT04083235) included 770 patients with mPDAC who were randomized (1:1) to receive liposomal irinotecan + 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin + oxaliplatin (NALIRIFOX) or nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine (Gem+NabP) in 28-day cycles. As previously reported, at a median follow-up of 16.1 months, NALIRIFOX demonstrated statistically significant improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival versus Gem+NabP. Here, we report EORTC QLQ-C30 results from NAPOLI 3. Methods: The EORTC QLQ-C30 was completed at baseline, day 1 of each 28-day cycle and at the end of treatment. A mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) model was used to describe the global health status (GHS) evolution over time between treatment arms. Time until definitive deterioration (TUDD) was defined as the time between randomization and first occurrence of a decrease ≥ 10 points in QLQ-C30 score without further improvement of ≥ 10 points or further data due to discontinuation. Results: Mean GHS scores at baseline were similar between treatment arms (NALIRIFOX 62.1; Gem+NabP 61.2); from week 16, there was a trend towards improvement in GHS scores in the NALIRIFOX arm relative to the Gem+NabP arm. The median TUDD of GHS was 15.7 months with NALIRIFOX and 12.2 months with Gem+NabP (stratified Cox hazard ratio 0.74 [95% confidence interval: 0.53–1.04]; nominal p = 0.08). At 6 months, 26.4% and 31.7% of patients NALIRIFOX and Gem+NabP arms, respectively, experienced definitive deterioration in GHS. The TUDD of physical, role and emotional functioning, pain, dyspnea and constipation were longer, with nominal p ≤ 0.05, in patients who received NALIRIFOX versus Gem+NabP. Conclusions: NALIRIFOX was associated with a trend towards improvement in GHS scores and longer TUDD in several EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales compared with Gem+NabP. However, these results should be interpreted with caution owing to the number of missing assessments. Clinical trial identification: NCT04083235.

"Assessing the Safety Profile of AMT-060 and Etranacogene Dezaparvovec Gene Therapies Across Clinical Trials in People with Severe/Moderately Severe Hemophilia B","Miesbach W., Recht M., Key N., Guillen-Gonzalez R., Sivamurthy K., Monahan P., Pipe S.","Research and Practice in Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023) 7 Supplement 2 Article Number: 100456. Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2023","2023","7",,,,"1 Oct 2023","Background: AMT-060 and etranacogene dezaparvovec are adeno-associated virus vector-based gene therapies. AMT-060 encodes wild-type factor IX (FIX); etranacogene dezaparvovec encodes the highly active FIX-Padua variant. Etranacogene dezaparvovec is the first gene therapy to obtain FDA approval for hemophilia B. Aims: Report safety across AMT-060 and etranacogene dezaparvovec trials. Methods: Three ongoing trials in hemophilia B have data over 5 (Phase 1/2 AMT-060; N = 10; NCT02396342), 3 (Phase 2b etranacogene dezaparvovec; N = 3; NCT03489291), and 2 years (Phase 3 HOPE-B etranacogene dezaparvovec; N = 54; NCT03569891). Investigator-reported adverse events (AEs) of alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations were defined per protocol as ≥2-fold baseline and/or >laboratory upper limit of normal (Phase 3; Phase 2b) or >1.5–2-fold baseline (Phase 1/2). Results: Across studies, all participants experienced ≥1 AE; most mild (Table), with no FIX inhibitor development or T-cell responses. In HOPE-B, 38 participants (70.4%) experienced 93 treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) and no treatment-related serious AEs (SAEs); a SAE of hepatocellular carcinoma was assessed as unrelated to treatment. There was one death, also assessed as unrelated to treatment. Eleven participants (20.4%) had ALT elevations; nine (16.7%) received corticosteroids (mean: 79.8 days; standard deviation: 26.6; range: 51–130), FIX activity was maintained. Seven participants experienced infusion-related reactions; three required temporary dose interruptions, four received supportive care (including antihistamines, corticosteroids, narcotics, epinephrine) and one discontinued treatment after partial dosing (∼10%). In Phase 2b, there were two TRAEs in one participant (headache; elevated C-reactive protein), that resolved without intervention, and one SAE unrelated to treatment (worsening of pre-existing avascular necrosis). Two participants experienced transaminase elevations that resolved without steroids and no impact on FIX activity. In Phase 1/2, seven participants experienced 15 TRAEs; five experienced six SAEs (three treatment related). Three participants received corticosteroids for ALT elevations. Conclusion(s): Across AMT-060 and etranacogene dezaparvovec studies, favorable safety profiles are observed. Most AEs were mild with few treatment-related SAEs.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2023","2023","21",,"s565","s566","1 Oct 2023","Background. The Phase 3 HOPE-B trial (NCT03569891) assesses etranacogene dezaparvovec, an investigational gene therapy for hemophilia B (HB) comprising an adeno-associated virus 5 (AAV5) vector and codonoptimised factor IX (FIX) Padua R338L transgene under the control of a liver-specific promoter. Methods. Adult male patients (n=54) with severe or moderately severe HB (FIX ≤2%), with (n=33) or without (n=21) pre-existing AAV5 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), were treated in the Phase 3 pivotal HOPE-B trial with single dose 2x10(13)gc/kg etranacogene dezaparvovec following a ≥6-month lead-in period of FIX prophylaxis. Annualized bleeding rate (ABR), uncontaminated endogenous FIX activity (one-stage assay), and FIX use were assessed, and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Results. Fifty-two (96%) patients discontinued and remained free of continuous FIX prophylaxis up to month 24, including 20 with baseline AAV5 NAb titres ≤1:678. One patient with the highest AAV5 NAb titre (1:3212) and one who received partial dose (∼10%) did not express FIX nor discontinue FIX prophylaxis. Median (IQR; range) endogenous FIX activity was sustained at 33.9% (25.9-45.5; 4.7-99.2) at Month 24 post-treatment (n=50); with 98% of patients expressing endogenous FIX activity being within mild or normal range. FIX activity levels were sustained irrespective of AAV5 NAb status (median [IQR; range] NAb+ ≤1:678: 33.5% [25.6-36.7; 9.1-88.3] and NAb-: 35.4% [26.1-47.4; 4.7-99.2]). Compared to lead-in (mean ABR 4.18), mean ABR for all bleeds during Months 7-24 post-treatment was significantly reduced by 64% (n=54; mean ABR 1.51; p=0.0002). Mean annualized FIX consumption per patient (n=54) decreased by 97% from lead-in to Months 7-24 (257,339 vs 8,946 IU/year; p<0.0001). Over 24 months post-dose, 38/54 (70%) patients had 93 treatment-related AEs of which none were serious. A previously reported serious AE of hepatocellular carcinoma was determined by independent molecular analysis to be unrelated to treatment. Nine (16.7%) patients received oral steroids during a median (range) of 74 days (51-130) for treatment-related ALT elevation (all resolved, and pre-steroid FIX levels were maintained). Conclusions. Single dose etranacogene dezaparvovec resulted in stable FIX expression in patients with AAV5 NAbs undetected or ≤1:678 titre with 94.4% of patients in the mild or normal FIX range at month 24; reduction in ABR remained durable and superior to FIX prophylaxis.",,,,L642906504,10.2450/BloodTransfus.2023.Suppl4

Atezolizumab (atezo) with bevacizumab (bev) is the standard of care for unresectable HCC based on statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and objective response rate versus sorafenib (IMbrave150 study). IMbrave050 was designed to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant atezo + bev to delay or prevent recurrence in patients (pts) with high-risk HCC. Methods: IMbrave050 (NCT04102098) enrolled pts with HCC at high risk of recurrence following resection or ablation (based on tumor burden (tumor size and number), vascular invasion, and tumor differentiation). Pts were randomized to Arm A (atezo 1200 mg + bev 15 mg/kg IV q3w for one year or 17 cycles) or Arm B (active surveillance for one year, eligible to crossover to Arm A following independent review facility (IRF) confirmation of recurrence). Stratification factors included geographic region and a composite factor encompassing the number of high-risk features, curative procedure, and use of optional adjuvant TACE (allowed for one cycle following resection). Primary endpoint was IRF-assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS). Secondary efficacy endpoints included OS, investigator-assessed RFS, RFS and OS according to PD-L1 status, and time to extrahepatic spread and/or macrovascular invasion. Results: The ITT population included 334 pts in both Arm A and B with well-balanced baseline demographics. At interim analysis (median follow-up: 17.36 mo, cuto ff date: Oct 21, 2022), primary endpoint was met with IRF-RFS HR of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.56, 0.93; p=0.0120) and results were generally consistent across clinical subgroups. Investigator-RFS was consistent [HR 0.70 (95% CI, 0.54, 0.91)]. The safety of atezo + bev was generally manageable and consistent with the well-established safety profile of each therapeutic agent and with the underlying disease. Conclusions: Atezo + bev is the first adjuvant regimen to demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in RFS vs active surveillance in pts at high risk of disease recurrence following resection or ablation. The benefit:risk profile of atezo + bev favors the use of this regimen as an adjuvant therapy and has potential to set a new standard of care in adjuvant HCC.

Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, were generally lower for STRIDE and D, than for S (Abou-Alfa GK et al. J Clin Oncol 2022;40[suppl 4]. Abs 379). To further assess the safety of STRIDE and D, we analysed the AE profiles incl. time to onset (TTO) and time to resolution (TTR; if available) for TRAEs and immune-mediated (im)AEs, and TRAEs leading to discontinuation. Methods: Safety was assessed in patients (pts) who received at least 1 dose of STRIDE (N=388), D (N=388) or S (N=374). Treatment causality was assessed by the investigator. TTO and TTR wereanalysed descriptively. Results: Duration of exposure to D was 327.2 and 312.7 total treatment years for STRIDE and D, respectively. Duration of exposure to S was 234.9 total treatment years. The median (interquartile range) number of treatment cycles of D was 6.0 (2.0-16.0) for STRIDE and 5.0 (3.0-14.5) for D. TRAEs occurred in 294 (75.8%) pts on STRIDE, 202 (52.1%) pts on D and 317 (84.8%) pts on S. TRAEs that occurred in ≥10% of pts in the STRIDE or D therapy arms were rash, pruritis, diarrhea and hypothyroidism. TRAEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 32 (8.2%) pts on STRIDE, 16 (4.1%) pts on D and 41 (11.0%) pts on S and included pneumonitis, colitis, diarrhea, hepatitis, immune-mediated hepatitis, rash, ALT and AST increase. TRAEs leading to death occurred in 9 (2.3%) pts on STRIDE, 0 pts on D and 3 (0.8%) pts on S. imAEs of any grade requiring high-dose steroids occurred in 78 (20.1%) pts on STRIDE, 37 (9.5%) pts on D and 7 (1.9%) pts on S. imAEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 22 (5.7%) pts on STRIDE, 10 (2.6%) pts on D and 6 (1.6%) pts on S. imAEs of any grade that occurred in ≥5% of pts in any treatment arm were hepatic events, diarrhea/colitis and hypothyroid events. Conclusion AE profiles of STRIDE and D in HIMALAYA were consistent with known safety profiles. Both STRIDE and D were tolerable, with manageable AEs per treatment guidelines and overall low rates of discontinuation due to TRAEs. mTTO of common AEs was generally <90 days with STRIDE and D. Safety data from HIMALAYA support STRIDE and D as new treatment options for pts with uHCC. Originally presented at the ILCA Annual Conference 2022.",,,,L642906980,10.1159/000533576

However, realworld data regarding the response to this regimen are lacking in high-risk patients with advanced HCC. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, 215 patients with advanced HCC who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment at four different tertiary hospitals were examined. High-risk patients had grade Vp4 portal vein thrombus, bile duct invasion, or more than 50% liver infiltration. Results: Among the 215 patients, 98 (45.6%) were in the high-risk population, 186 (86.5%) had Child- Pugh class A, 29 (13.5%) had Child-Pugh class B, and 128 (59.5%) had previously received neoadjuvant or concomitant radiation treatment. Analysis of the total population indicated that the median PFS was 8.00 months (95% CI, 6.82-9.18) and median OS was 11.25 months (95% CI, 9.50-13.10). In the high-risk population, the median progression free survival (PFS) was 6.50 months (95% CI, 3.93-9.08), and the median overall survival (OS) was 10 months (95% CI, 8.19-11.82). In the high-risk population, multivariate analysis indicated that receipt of neoadjuvant or concomitant radiation therapy was associated with better PFS and OS; median OS; 12.00 months (9.33- 14.67) vs. 5.75 (3.24-8.26) and median PFS; 9.25 months (7.66-10.84) vs. 3.25 (2.27-4.23) in radiation and without radiation therapy, respectively. Ninety-two patients (42.8%) experienced adverse events of any grade; the most common adverse event was proteinuria (14.8%).

The favorable antiviral effect of BSV may lower the risk of HCC in patients with CHB. Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of information concerning the impact of BSV treatment on the occurrence of HCC. We aimed to assess the incidence of HCC under BSV therapy using clinical trial and realworld BSV data and to compare it with that observed during entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) therapy. Methods: We combined the phase 3 clinical trial data of BSV which was conducted for 8 years and retrospective data which was collected in the realworld. The retrospective cohort consisted of patients who initiated ETV, TDF, or BSV as a first treatment between 2007 and 2022 at five tertiary hospitals. Incidences of HCC under these antiviral therapies were compared. To further validate, we conducted propensity score matching with an optimal variable ratio of 1:2 or 1:1 for the ETV or TDF treatment groups, respectively. This approach allowed us to create matched cohorts and enabled a more meaningful comparison of HCC incidences between the groups. We performed the log-rank test to evaluate any significant differences. Results: A total of 385, 1139, and 688 patients were treated with BSV, ETV, and TDF, respectively. The incidence of HCC was significantly lower in the BSV group compared with ETV or TDF groups (BSV vs ETV, P=0.007; BSV vs. TDF, P=0.015). After propensity score matching, we observed that the incidence rate of HCC remained significantly lower in the BSV group in comparison to the ETV group (P =0.016). However, there was no significant difference in HCC incidence rates between the BSV and TDF groups (P=0.253). Further analysis using multivariable analysis within this matched cohort indicated that BSV significantly reduced the risk of developing HCC when compared to ETV. Conclusion: BSV therapy may improve prognosis of patients with CHB by decreasing the incidence of HCC.",,,,L643193955,10.1097/HEP.0000000000000580

We investigated potential differences in efficacy and safety of immunotherapy between female versus male HCC patients. Methods: A restricted maximum likelihood random effects meta-analysis of five phase III trials that evaluated immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in advanced HCC and reported overall survival (OS) hazard ratios according to sex was performed to evaluate sex-related differences in OS. In a real-world cohort of 840 HCC patients from 22 centres included between 2018 and 2023, we directly compared the efficacy and safety of A+B between females and males. Best radiological response was reported according to RECISTv1.1. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were calculated for OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and time to progression (TTP). Results: In the meta-analysis, immunotherapy was associated with a significant OS benefit only in male (pooled HR: 0.79 [95%CI: 0.73- 0.86]) but not in female HCC patients (pooled HR: 0.85 [95%CI: 0.70-1.03], Figure). Among 840 patients, 677 patients (81%) were male (mean age 66 ± 11 y), and 163 patients (19%) were female (mean age 67 ± 12 y). Prevalence of cirrhosis, liver function and tumour stages were comparable between the two sexes. Grade ≥3 AEs occurred in 15% of female and 12% of male patients (p = 0.312). Type and severity of AEs were similar between the two groups. OS (median OS, 15.9 mo, 95%CI: 14.0-17.8 vs. 15.0 mo, 95%CI: 11.8- 18.2; p =0.409), PFS (median PFS, 6.6 mo, 95%CI: 5.7-7.5 vs. 7.3 mo, 95%CI: 4.8-9.9), and TTP (median TTP, 7.1 mo, 95%CI: 6.3-7.9 vs. 7.3 mo, 95%CI: 4.3- 10.4) were comparable between male and female patients upon uni- and multivariable analyses (adjusted hazard ratio for OS, PFS, and TTP: 0.79 [95%CI: 0.59- 1.04], 1.02 [95%CI: 0.80-1.30], 0.90 [95%CI: 0.68- 1.18]). Objective response rate (24% vs. 22%) and disease control rate (59% vs. 59%) were also similar between males and females.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in patients with unresectable HCC who progressed during sorafenib treatment in a real-life cohort. Methods: In this retrospective, observational, multicenter study, adult Child-Pugh A/7B patients with HCC who tolerated sorafenib therapy but progressed were started on nivolumab (n = 38). A similar number of consecutive, unselected patients who were maintained on sorafenib therapy, regardless of tumoral response or progression, were used as historical controls (n =42). Patients were assessed in terms of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, macrovascular invasion, and extrahepatic disease to best supportive care plus oral sorafenib or intravenous nivolumab as second-line therapy. The primary endpoint was overall survival (defined as time from starting sorafenib in either group, up to death due to any cause) and analyzed by intention-to-treat. Results: The mean age of the overall cohort was 72.4 ± 10.1 years, of whom 87.5% were males, and 58.8% had underlying viral etiology. Patients in the two cohorts were similar except that those who received nivolumab as 2nd line therapy compared to sorafenib alone had more comorbidities (70.0 vs 15.4%), more ECOG-2 status (21.4 vs 15.8%), and extravascular invasion (54.4 vs 21.8 %) (P< 0.05 for all). More patients in the nivolumab arm were Child-Pugh B (35.7 vs 21.1%), although this did not reach statistical significance (P =0.15). Median survival was significantly higher in patients who received nivolumab compared to sorafenib alone (22.0 vs 11.0 mo, P =0.014, Figure 1). Median survival after starting nivolumab as 2nd line therapy was 9.2 months, and time-to-tumor progression was 4.92 (IQR 3.2 - 6.3) months. Conclusion: Nivolumab is an effective second- line treatment option in unresectable HCC patients who progress on sorafenib, with significantly improved overall survival.

However, the long-term survival and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with decompensated cirrhosis following DAA treatment is unclear. Methods: This study included 99 of the 102 patients who participated in the Japanese phase 3 trial on the effect of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) with or without ribavirin (RBV) treatment in HCV patients with decompensated cirrhosis and who agreed to a long-term follow-up study. In the trial, patients started SOF/VEL with or without RBV treatment for 12 weeks between January 2017 and August 2017 at 33 Japanese hospitals. Decompensated cirrhosis was defined as Child-Pugh class B (CPB) or CP-C at screening. We collected laboratory and clinical data at baseline, end of the treatment (EOT), 12 weeks after the EOT, 24 weeks after the EOT, 1 year after the EOT and every 1 year thereafter. Incidence rates of and baseline factors associated with overall survival and HCC development after DAA treatment were examined by Cox proportional hazard analysis. Results: The median age was 67 years, 40% of the patients were male, and seven patients had a history of HCC. The proportions of patients with CP-A, CP-B and CP-C at baseline were 12%, 77%, and 10%, respectively. The median observation period of this study was 58.7 months from the start of DAA. The percentage of patients with CP-A after starting DAA treatment was 22.2% (20/90) at the EOT, 43% (33/77) at 1 year after the EOT, 48% (36/75) at 3 years after the EOT, and 54% (27/50) at 5years after the EOT. Nineteen patients died, and the 3-year and 5-year overall survival rates were 92.4% and 76.6%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, higher γ-glutamyl transpeptidase levels (hazard ratio (HR): 1.020, p = 0.009), higher total bilirubin levels (HR: 1.941, p < 0.001), and lower albumin levels (HR: 0.164, p =0.010) were significant baseline factors for overall survival after DAA treatment. For HCC development, 34 patients experienced HCC occurrence, and three patients experienced HCC recurrence. Cumulative HCC occurrence and HCC recurrence rates at 3 years were 28.4% and 57.1%, respectively. On univariate analysis, the presence of a history of HCC (HR: 2.898, p = 0.050) and lower albumin levels (HR: 0.363, p =0.025) were significant baseline factors for HCC development after DAA treatment. Conclusion: In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, improvement in liver function is maintained over the long term after DAA treatment, and long-term survival is favorable.

TAF, a novel prodrug of tenofovir, is a first-line recommended treatment for CHB and has shown efficacy comparable to TDF with higher rates of ALT normalization and no resistance. In an integrated analysis of 2 global Phase 3 studies, we evaluated HCC incidence and risk at 8 years (Week 384) in CHB patients treated solely with TAF and those treated initially with TDF and then switched to TAF for up to 6 years (y). Methods: In 2 similarly designed studies, HBeAg-positive (n = 859) and -negative (n =439) CHB patients with HBV DNA ≥ 20,000 IU/mL and ALT >60 U/L (males) or > 38 U/L (females) were randomized (2:1) to TAF 25 mg or TDF 300 mg given once daily in a double-blind (DB) phase for up to 3 y, followed by openlabel (OL) TAF through Y8. HCC was assessed by local standards of care and by hepatic ultrasonography introduced after Week 96 and performed at 6-month intervals. Three validated models (REACH-B, aMAP, and mPAGE-B) were utilized to assess HCC risk by initial treatment assignment and collectively. Using the REACH-B model, standard incidence ratios (SIRs) for HCC (observed vs model-predicted HCC rates) were calculated; for aMAP and mPAGE-B, shifts in baseline risk for HCC were determined at Week 384. Results: Through Y8, HCC was diagnosed in 21/1298 patients (1.6%; TAF 1.4% [12/866]; TDF→TAF 2.1% [9/432]; p =0.33 by logrank test)-11 in DB/10 in OL phase. Eight of 21 HCC cases were in cirrhotic patients. Median (Q1, Q3) time to HCC onset was 729 (388, 1373) days (TAF 1291 [397, 1629], TDF→TAF 460 [180, 729] days). Advanced age, male gender, and cirrhosis (defined as FibroTest ≥0.75) were more common in HCC vs non-HCC patients (p < 0.05). Proportionately more HCC patients were HBV genotype C (76% vs 47%) and had BL HBV DNA between 6 to ≤ 8 log10 IU/mL (57% vs 38%).

Of patients predicted to be low risk for HCC at BL, nearly all remained low risk at Y8 by aMAP (98%) and mPAGE-B (97%), and substantial proportions estimated to be medium or high risk at BL shifted to a lower risk at Y8 (aMAP: 45% and 72%; mPAGE-B: 27% and 51%, respectively).

Therefore, a clinical study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of the anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab plus the VEGFR2-targeted TKI rivoceranib (also known as apatinib) versus sorafenib as first-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: This randomised, open-label, international phase 3 trial (CARES-310) was done at 95 study sites across 13 countries and regions worldwide. Patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma who had not previously received any systemic treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either camrelizumab 200 mg intravenously every 2 weeks plus rivoceranib 250 mg orally once daily or sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily. Randomisation was done via a centralised interactive response system. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival, as assessed by the blinded independent review committee per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1, and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drugs. We report the findings from the prespecified primary analysis for progression-free survival and interim analysis for overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03764293). Findings: Between June 28, 2019, and March 24, 2021, 543 patients were randomly assigned to the camrelizumab–rivoceranib (n=272) or sorafenib (n=271) group. At the primary analysis for progression-free survival (May 10, 2021), median follow-up was 7·8 months (IQR 4·1–10·6). Median progression-free survival was significantly improved with camrelizumab–rivoceranib versus sorafenib (5·6 months [95% CI 5·5–6·3] vs 3·7 months [2·8–3·7]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·52 [95% CI 0·41–0·65]; one-sided p<0·0001). At the interim analysis for overall survival (Feb 8, 2022), median follow-up was 14·5 months (IQR 9·1–18·7). Median overall survival was significantly extended with camrelizumab–rivoceranib versus sorafenib (22·1 months [95% CI 19·1–27·2] vs 15·2 months [13·0–18·5]; HR 0·62 [95% CI 0·49–0·80]; one-sided p<0·0001). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were hypertension (102 [38%] of 272 patients in the camrelizumab–rivoceranib group vs 40 [15%] of 269 patients in the sorafenib group), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (33 [12%] vs 41 [15%]), increased aspartate aminotransferase (45 [17%] vs 14 [5%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (35 [13%] vs eight [3%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 66 (24%) patients in the camrelizumab–rivoceranib group and 16 (6%) in the sorafenib group. Treatment-related death occurred in two patients: one patient in the camrelizumab–rivoceranib group (ie, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome) and one patient in the sorafenib group (ie, respiratory failure and circulatory collapse). Interpretation: Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival compared with sorafenib for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, presenting as a new and effective first-line treatment option for this population.

We hypothesized subsequent treatment with sorafenib could demonstrate superior efficacy. Methods: This random phase III open-label study evaluated the sequential treatment with pexa-vec followed by sorafenib compared to sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC and no prior systemic treatment. The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS). Key secondary endpoints included time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival, overall response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR). Safety was assessed in all patients who received ≥1 dose of study treatment. Results: The study was conducted at 142 sites in 16 countries. From December 30, 2015, to the interim analysis on August 2, 2019, 459 patients were randomly assigned (pexa-vec plus sorafenib: 234, sorafenib: 225). At the interim analysis, the median OS was 12.7 months (95% CI: 9.89, 14.95) in the pexa-vec plus sorafenib arm and 14.0 months (95% CI: 11.01, 18.00) in the sorafenib arm. This led to the early termination of the study. The median TTP was 2.0 months (95% CI: 1.77, 2.96) and 4.2 months (95% CI: 2.92, 4.63); ORR was 19.2% (45 patients) and 20.9% (47 patients); and DCR was 50.0% (117 patients) and 57.3% (129 patients) in the pexa-vec plus sorafenib and sorafenib arms, respectively. Serious adverse events were reported in 117 (53.7%) patients in the pexa-vec plus sorafenib and 77 (35.5%) patients in the sorafenib arm. Liver failure was the most frequently reported in both groups. Conclusion: Sequential pexa-vec plus sorafenib treatment did not demonstrate increased clinical benefit in advanced HCC and fared worse compared to sorafenib alone. The advent of the added value of checkpoint inhibitors should direct any further development of oncolytic virus therapy strategies.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02562755)",,,L2028795774,10.1159/000533650

Design A three-state partitioned survival model using clinical survival data from a phase III LAUNCH trial, a 5-year time horizon for costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was constructed to analyse the cost-effectiveness of LEN-TACE. Clinical inputs were extracted from the LAUNCH trial, with outcomes extrapolated using standard and flexible parametric survival models. Costs and utilities derived from published literature were discounted at an annual rate of 5%. Sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model. Setting The Chinese healthcare system perspective. Participants A hypothetical Chinese cohort of patients with advanced HCC. Interventions TACE plus LEN versus LEN. Primary outcome measure Costs, QALYs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results Base-case analysis revealed that LEN-TACE would be cost-effective in China at the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $37 663 per QALYs, with improved effectiveness of 0.382 QALYs and additional cost of $12 151 (ICER: $31 808 per QALY). The probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that LEN-TACE had a 93.5% probability of cost-effectiveness at WTP threshold of three times gross domestic product per capital ($37 663). One-way deterministic sensitivity analysis indicated that the duration of LEN treatment in both two arms, utility of progression-free survival and the cost of TACE had a greater impact on the stability of ICER values. Scenario analyses results were in line with base-case analysis. Conclusions LEN-TACE might be a cost-effective strategy compared with LEN for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced HCC in China.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03905967)",,37751954,L2027746155,10.1136/bmjopen-2023-074245

Date of Publication: 20 Sep 2023","2023","24","5",,,"20 Sep 2023","Omics data from clinical samples are the predominant source of target discovery and drug development. Typically, hundreds or thousands of differentially expressed genes or proteins can be identified from omics data. This scale of possibilities is overwhelming for target discovery and validation using biochemical or cellular experiments. Most of these proteins and genes have no corresponding drugs or even active compounds. Moreover, a proportion of them may have been previously reported as being relevant to the disease of interest. To facilitate translational drug discovery from omics data, we have developed a new classification tool named Omics and Text driven Translational Medicine (OTTM). This tool can markedly narrow the range of proteins or genes that merit further validation via drug availability assessment and literature mining. For the 4489 candidate proteins identified in our previous proteomics study, OTTM recommended 40 FDA-approved or clinical trial drugs. Of these, 15 are available commercially and were tested on hepatocellular carcinoma Hep-G2 cells. Two drugs-tafenoquine succinate (an FDA-approved antimalarial drug targeting CYC1) and branaplam (a Phase 3 clinical drug targeting SMN1 for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy)-showed potent inhibitory activity against Hep-G2 cell viability, suggesting that CYC1 and SMN1 may be potential therapeutic target proteins for hepatocellular carcinoma. In summary, OTTM is an efficient classification tool that can accelerate the discovery of effective drugs and targets using thousands of candidate proteins identified from omics data.

Methods: This was a PRISMA-standard review and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021244588). MEDLINE and Embase were systematically searched (March 24, 2021) to identify publications reporting the efficacy and/or safety of systemic anticancer therapy (vs. any/no comparator) in liver-function-defined subgroups in phase 2 or 3 aHCC trials. Screening was completed by a single reviewer, with uncertainties resolved by a second reviewer and/or the authors. English-language full-text articles and congress abstracts were eligible for inclusion. Included publications were described and assessed for risk of bias using the GRADE methodology. Results: Twenty (of 2,579) screened publications were eligible; seven categorized liver function using the albumin-bilirubin system, nine using the Child-Pugh system, four using both. GRADE assessment classified ten, nine, and one publication(s) as reporting moderate-quality, low-quality, and very-low-quality evidence, respectively. Analyses of cross-trial trends of within-exposure arm analyses (active and control) reported a positive relationship between baseline liver function and overall survival and progression-free survival, supporting liver function as a prognostic marker in aHCC. There were also signals for a modest relationship between more preserved baseline liver function and extent of systemic treatment benefit, and with more preserved liver function and lower incidence of safety events. Conclusion: This review supports liver function as a prognostic variable in aHCC and highlights the value of a priori stratification of patients by baseline liver function in aHCC trials. The predictive value of liver function warrants further study.

Outcomes based on an additional 18 months of follow-up are reported. Methods: Adults with sorafenib-treated advanced HCC were randomized 2:1 to pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks or placebo. Dual primary endpoints were OS and PFS assessed per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), assessed per RECIST v1.1 by BICR, and safety. Results: 413 patients were randomized (pembrolizumab, n = 278; placebo, n = 135).

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2023","2023","6","S1",,,"1 Sep 2023","Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The incidence of HCC is affected by genetic and non-genetic factors. Genetically, mutations in the genes, tumor protein P53 (TP53), catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1), AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARIC1A), cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), mannose 6-phosphate (M6P), smooth muscle action against decapentaplegic (SMAD2), retinoblastoma gene (RB1), cyclin D, antigen presenting cells (APC), AXIN1, and E-cadherin, have been shown to contribute to the occurrence of HCC. Non-genetic factors, including alcohol consumption, exposure to aflatoxin, age, gender, presence of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), increase the risk of HCC. Recent Findings: The severity of the disease and its occurrence vary based on geographical location. Furthermore, men and minorities have been shown to be disproportionately affected by HCC, compared with women and non-minorities. Ethnicity has been reported to significantly affect tumorigenesis and clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with HCC. Generally, differences in gene expression and/or the presence of comorbid medical diseases affect or influence the progression of HCC. Non-Caucasian HCC patients are significantly more likely to have poorer survival outcomes, compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Finally, there are a number of factors that contribute to the success rate of treatments for HCC. Conclusion: Assessment and treatment of HCC must be consistent using evidence-based guidelines and standardized outcomes, as well as international clinical practice guidelines for global consensus. Standardizing the assessment approach and method will enable comparison and improvement of liver cancer research through collaboration between researchers, healthcare providers, and advocacy groups. In this review, we will focus on discussing epidemiological factors that result in deviations and changes in treatment approaches for HCC.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03434379)",,37344125,L2025493069,10.1002/cnr2.1821

Infecting the tumor cells by these viruses can lead to direct lysis or induction of immune responses. However, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is considered a significant challenge for oncolytic virotherapy in treating cancer. Based on OV type, hypoxic conditions in the TME can accelerate or repress virus replication. Therefore, genetic manipulation of OVs or other molecular modifications to reduce hypoxia can induce antitumor responses. Moreover, using OVs with tumor lysis capability in the hypoxic TME may be an attractive strategy to overcome the limitations of the therapy.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2023","2023","107","9","275","276","1 Sep 2023","Background: Tumoral macrovascular invasion (MVI) of hepatic and/ or portal vein branches is a common phenomenon in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is associated with poorer prognosis when compared to HCC without MVI. Systemic therapy remains to be the recommended first-line treatment. Trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE) along with Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) are promising alternative treatments as shown in this case. Methods: A retrospective case note study and evaluation with interpretation of results using PET CT follow up. Results: In the current international guidelines for the management of HCC, Systemic chemotherapy/ Immunotherapy is recommended as the only treatment option in case of MVI. Despite the recommendations, several alternative treatment options have been tested, which include trans-arterial chemoembolization, external or internal radiation, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, percutaneous ablation, or the combination of two or more of these strategies, with or without systemic treatment. In this case report, we present a 67 year old male, diagnosed with Hepatitis B virus related cirrhosis with right lobe HCC and right portal vein invasion (extending to left portal vein), treated with TARE for the parenchymal tumour followed by SBRT for the portal vein tumour thrombus. Complete resolution of the tumour and the portal vein tumour thrombus was noted with biochemical remission for 8 months following the treatment and remains free from tumour progression. He is currently on the wait list for Liver transplantation. Conclusions: There is growing evidence which suggest that alternative strategies to the standard-of-care systemic therapies improve overall survival in patients with advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma with Macrovascular Invasion, however the level of evidence remains weak.

This exploratory analysis reports efficacy and safety results in patients with baseline Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B disease. Methods: Patients with systemic treatment-naive unresectable HCC and Child-Pugh class A liver function were randomized 2:1 to receive 1,200 mg of atezolizumab plus 15 mg/kg of bevacizumab or 400 mg of sorafenib. Co-primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) per independent review facility (IRF)-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 in the BCLC stage B subgroup. Patients in this analysis had BCLC stage B disease at baseline per electronic case report form. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the objective response rate (ORR) and change in the sum of longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions from baseline per IRF RECIST 1.1 and modified RECIST (mRECIST) for HCC. Results: Of 501 enrolled patients, 74 (15%) had BCLC stage B disease at baseline (atezolizumab + bevacizumab, n = 49; sorafenib, n = 24). For this group, median follow-up was 19.7 months. A trend toward improved OS and PFS per IRF RECIST 1.1 was observed with atezolizumab + bevacizumab versus sorafenib (OS: hazard ratio [HR]: 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29, 1.34; PFS: HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.36, 1.12). ORRs per IRF RECIST 1.1 and HCC mRECIST were 43% and 50% with atezolizumab + bevacizumab and 26% and 30% with sorafenib, respectively. Percentage change in SLD of target lesions from baseline per IRF RECIST 1.1 and HCC mRECIST showed durable responses with atezolizumab + bevacizumab treatment. Safety data were consistent with known profiles of atezolizumab and bevacizumab, as seen in the overall study population.

Recently, Bulevirtide (BLV), a first-in-class HBV-HDV entry inhibitor blocking Na(+)-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP), has provided very promising efficacy data in Phase II and Phase III (interim analysis) trials as well as in preliminary real-life reports. In July 2020, BLV has granted conditional approval by EMA for treatment of compensated CHD, at the dose of 2 mg/day by self-administered subcutaneous injections. In Phase II and Phase III trials, BLV was evaluated at different doses (2 vs. 10 mg/day) for 24 or 48 weeks, either in monotherapy or in combination with PegIFN. Administration of BLV monotherapy for 24 or 48 weeks resulted in 50%–83% virological response (HDV RNA ≥ 2 Log decline) rates and 45%–78% ALT normalization. Combination therapy with PegIFN provided synergistic effects.

Surgical ablation, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and, most recently, immunotherapy have all been investigated for HCC, but none have yielded the desired outcomes. Several unique nanocarrier drug delivery techniques have been studied for their potential therapeutic implications in the treatment of HCC. Nanoparticle-based imaging could be effective for more accurate HCC diagnosis. Since its inception, nanomedicine has significantly transformed the approach to both the treatment and diagnostics of liver cancer. Nanoparticles (NPs) are being studied as a potential treatment for liver cancer because of their ability to carry small substances, such as treatment with chemotherapy, microRNA, and therapeutic genes. The primary focus of this study is on the most current discoveries and practical uses of nanomedicine-based diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for liver cancer. In this section, we had gone over what we know about metabolic dysfunction in HCC and the treatment options that attempt to fix it by targeting metabolic pathways. Furthermore, we propose a multi-target metabolic strategy as a viable HCC treatment option.

This analysis examined the HRQoL outcomes in pts in both arms. Methods: Systemic therapy-naïve adults with histologically confirmed uHCC were randomized 1:1 to receive TIS (200 mg IV Q3W, n=342) or SOR (400 mg PO BID, n=332). HRQoL was assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-HCC18 and EQ5D-5L. A mixed model for repeated measures using key pre-specified PRO endpoints of global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL), physical functioning and fatigue scales of the QLQ-C30, and HCC18 index score, fatigue and pain scores at the key pre-specified clinical cycles 4 and 6 were performed. Time to deterioration was examined with the Kaplan-Meier method using the PRO endpoints. Results: At both cycles, TIS had better HRQoL outcomes than SOR, as indicated by LS mean differences in GHS/QoL, physical functioning, fatigue and HCC symptom index, but not for pain. TIS had a lower risk for deterioration of QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68 [95% CI, 0.49-0.94]), physical functioning (0.53 [0.39-0.73]) and fatigue (0.48 [0.37, 0.63]) as well as for deterioration in the HCC18 index (0.53 [0.34-0.81]) and fatigue (0.60 [0.46-0.80]). Both arms had a similar risk for deterioration in pain (HR 0.78 [0.56-1.09]). TIS maintained while SOR declined EQ-5D-5L VAS (general health status) scores at cycle 4 (mean change from baseline =-0.4 [SD = 14.52] vs -4.3 [12.92]) and cycle 6 (-0.2 [17.03] vs -5.4 [13.09]). Conclusions: Pts with HCC treated with 1L TIS had better HRQoL outcomes compared with pts treated with SOR, particularly in terms of fatigue and physical functioning.

Analysis of the costs and causes of translational failure may help to reduce attrition and permit the more appropriate use of resources to reduce mortality from cancer. Objective: To analyze the causes of failure and expenses incurred in clinical trials of novel oncology drugs, with the example of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibitors, none of which was approved for use in oncology practice. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, inhibitors of the IGF-1R and their clinical trials for use in oncology practice between January 1, 2000, and July 31, 2021, were identified by searching PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov. A proprietary commercial database was interrogated to provide expenses incurred in these trials. If data were not available, estimates were made of expenses using mean values from the proprietary database. A search revealed studies of the effects of IGF-1R inhibitors in preclinical in vivo assays, permitting calculation of the percentage of tumor growth inhibition. Archival data on the clinical trials of IGF-1R inhibitors and proprietary estimates of their expenses were examined, together with an analysis of preclinical data on IGF-1R inhibitors obtained from the published literature. Main Outcomes and Measures: Expenses associated with research and development of IGF-1R inhibitors. Results: Sixteen inhibitors of IGF-1R studied in 183 clinical trials were found. None of the trials, in a wide range of tumor types, showed efficacy permitting drug approval. More than 12000 patients entered trials of IGF-1R inhibitors in oncology indications in 2003 to 2021. These trials incurred aggregate research and development expenses estimated at between $1.6 billion and $2.3 billion. Analysis of the results of preclinical in vivo assays of IGF-1R inhibitors that supported subsequent clinical investigations showed mixed activity and protocols that poorly reflected the treatment of advanced metastatic tumors in humans. Conclusions and Relevance: Failed drug development in oncology incurs substantial expense. At an industry level, an estimated $50 billion to $60 billion is spent annually on failed oncology trials. Improved target validation and more appropriate preclinical models are required to reduce attrition, with more attention to decision-making before launching clinical trials.

However, direct comparison with other combination treatments including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) + tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are lacking. Objectives: This network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to indirectly compare the efficacy and the safety of firstline systemic therapies for unresectable advanced HCC. Method: A literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, and SCOPUS databases was conducted up to October 31, 2022. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing TKIs, including sorafenib and lenvatinib, or ICIs reporting overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were included. Individual survival data were extracted from OS and PFS curves to calculate restricted mean survival time. A Bayesian NMA was performed to compare treatments in terms of efficacy (15- and 30-month OS, 6-month PFS) and safety, represented by grade .3 (severe) adverse events (SAEs). The incremental safety-effectiveness ratio as measure of net health benefit was calculated as the difference in SAE probability divided by survival difference between the 2 most effective treatments. Results: Nine RCTs enrolling 6,600 patients were included. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab showed the highest probability (88%) of achieving the 30-month OS landmark. Lenvatinib showed a probability of 86% of achieving best PFS outcomes. ICI monotherapies ranked as most tolerable. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab showed the best net health benefit for OS, compared to durvalumab plus tremelimumab. When evaluating the net health benefit for PFS, at a willingness-to-risk threshold of 10% of SAEs for life-month gained, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was favoured in 78% of cases, while at threshold of 30% of SAEs for life-month gained, lenvatinib was favoured in 76% of cases. Conclusions: Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is the best treatment in terms of net benefit and therefore it should be recommended as standard of care.

Various systemic chemotherapy drugs have been approved and are recommended by clinical guidelines worldwide. Although systemic treatments are effective and contribute to prolonged patient survival, their effects are unsatisfactory for some specific tumor conditions, such as macrovascular invasion. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is a traditional treatment for advanced HCC. As yet, there is no worldwide consensus recommending HAIC because no high-quality clinical trials have demonstrated its survival benefit. However, clinical evidence is gradually accumulating that shows its survival benefit, and it is recognized as an effective locoregional treatment for advanced HCC. Several HAIC regimens have been reported, including cisplatin monotherapy, cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (low-dose FP), lipiodol-suspended FP, and an oxaliplatin-based regimen. We have entered an era of chemo-diversity in the treatment of advanced HCC. This review aimed to clarify the relevance of HAIC in the era of chemo-diversity.

Recently, immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICIs) have been extensively tested in this setting. Multiple ICI combination regimens have recently received regulatory approval and new data continues to emerge. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the most up-to-date evidence on ICI combinations in advanced HCC. Methods: A search of published and presented literature was conducted to identify phase III trials of ICI combinations in advanced HCC patients. Supplemental bibliographic search of review articles and meta-analyses was also conducted. Efficacy and safety data was summarized in text, tables, and plots. Findings and discussion: The literature search identified a total of six phase III trials assessing ICI combinations in advanced HCC. Two trials compared ICI plus anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody combinations to sorafenib, three trials compared ICI plus tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) combinations to TKIs alone, and one trial compared a dual ICI regimen to sorafenib. Statistically significant survival benefits were seen with atezolizumab-bevacizumab and sintilimab-bevacizumab biosimilar as well as durvalumab-tremelimumab and camrelizumab-rivoceranib combinations. ICI combination regimens have also shown improvements in response rates and progression-free survival relative to the previous standard of care, sorafenib, and generally presented predictable and manageable safety profiles. Conclusion: ICI combinations represent the new standard of care for advanced HCC. Ongoing randomized trials and real-world evidence will further clarify the role of these combinations in this rapidly evolving field.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01730937, NCT03298451, NCT03434379, NCT03713593, NCT03755791, NCT03764293, NCT03778957, NCT03794440, NCT03847428, NCT04039607, NCT04102098, NCT04194775, NCT04246177, NCT04340193, NCT04344158, NCT04465734, NCT04523493, NCT04560894, NCT04639180, NCT04665609, NCT04682210, NCT04712643, NCT04720716, NCT04723004, NCT04770896, NCT04777851, NCT04803994, NCT04985136, NCT05056337, NCT05198609, NCT05250843, NCT05301842, NCT05313282, NCT05320692, NCT05564338)",,37336142,L2025180124,10.1016/j.ctrv.2023.102584

This disease disproportionately affects those in countries with low or medium Human Development Index scores in Eastern Asia, South-Eastern Asia, and Northern and Western Africa (2). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of primary liver cancer, often develops in the background of chronic liver disease, caused by hepatitis B or C virus, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or other diseases that cause cirrhosis. Prognosis can vary dramatically based on number, size, and location of tumors. Hepatic synthetic dysfunction and performance status (PS) also impact survival. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system best accounts for these variations, providing a reliable prognostic stratification. Therapeutic considerations of this complex disease necessitate a multidisciplinary approach and can range from curative-intent surgical resection, liver transplantation or image-guided ablation to more complex liver-directed therapies like transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and systemic therapy. Recent advances in the understanding of the tumor biology and microenvironment have brought new advances and approvals for systemic therapeutic agents, often utilizing immunotherapy or VEGF-targeted agents to modulate the immune response.

Date of Publication: 8 Jun 2023","2023","13","2","119","135","8 Jun 2023","Background: The incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCCA) is rising around the world. The disease is becoming a major global health issue. Conventionally, most patients with cholangiocarcinoma present with advanced disease and systemic therapy is the mainstay of treatment. This review discusses recent advances in systemic treatments for patients with IHCCA. Summary: The addition of durvalumab to a gemcitabine plus cisplatin regimen has significantly improved overall survival in the phase 3 TOPAZ- 1 trial and is currently recommended as a standard first-line treatment. The phase 3 ABC-06 and phase 2b NIFTY trials have shown the benefit of second-line fluoropyrimidine plus oxaliplatin, and fluoropyrimidine plus nanoliposomal irinotecan, respectively. They have provided a treatment option for patients without actionable alterations who progressed to first-line therapy. For patients with actionable genomic alterations, including FGFR2 rearrangement, IDH1 mutation, BRAF mutation, and ERBB2 amplification, targeted agents have shown encouraging efficacy in several phase 2-3 trials, and are recommended as subsequent treatments. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are being investigated for the treatment of previously treated patients, although only a small proportion of patients showed durable responses. Key Messages: Recent advances in systemic treatments have improved clinical outcomes in patients with advanced IHCCA. However, most patients eventually show resistance to the treatment, and tumor progression occurs within a year. Indeed, there should be further efforts to improve the outcomes of patients with advanced IHCCA.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03110484, NCT03260712, NCT03633773, NCT03639935, NCT03656536, NCT03768414, NCT03801083, NCT04003636, NCT04042831, NCT04059562, NCT04066491, NCT04111380, NCT04211168, NCT04298021, NCT04353375, NCT04466891, NCT04521686, NCT04526106, NCT04550624, NCT04677504, NCT04692051, NCT04727996, NCT04910386, NCT04941287, NCT05052099, NCT05170438, NCT05174650, NCT05190575, NCT05222971, NCT05342194, NCT05510427)",,,L2031750946,10.1159/000531458

The standard-of-care treatment for advanced biliary tract cancer is chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin. Because most biliary tract cancers have an immune-suppressed microenvironment, immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy is associated with a low objective response rate. We aimed to assess whether adding the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin would improve outcomes compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer. Methods: KEYNOTE-966 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 175 medical centres globally. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older; had previously untreated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer; had disease measurable per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1; and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo, both administered intravenously every 3 weeks (maximum 35 cycles), in combination with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks; no maximum duration) and cisplatin (25 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks; maximum 8 cycles). Randomisation was done using a central interactive voice-response system and stratified by geographical region, disease stage, and site of origin in block sizes of four. The primary endpoint of overall survival was evaluated in the intention-to-treat population. The secondary endpoint of safety was evaluated in the as-treated population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04003636. Findings: Between Oct 4, 2019, and June 8, 2021, 1564 patients were screened for eligibility, 1069 of whom were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin (pembrolizumab group; n=533) or placebo plus gemcitabine and cisplatin (placebo group; n=536). Median study follow-up at final analysis was 25·6 months (IQR 21·7–30·4). Median overall survival was 12·7 months (95% CI 11·5–13·6) in the pembrolizumab group versus 10·9 months (9·9–11·6) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·83 [95% CI 0·72–0·95]; one-sided p=0·0034 [significance threshold, p=0·0200]). In the as-treated population, the maximum adverse event grade was 3 to 4 in 420 (79%) of 529 participants in the pembrolizumab group and 400 (75%) of 534 in the placebo group; 369 (70%) participants in the pembrolizumab group and 367 (69%) in the placebo group had treatment-related adverse events with a maximum grade of 3 to 4. 31 (6%) participants in the pembrolizumab group and 49 (9%) in the placebo group died due to adverse events, including eight (2%) in the pembrolizumab group and three (1%) in the placebo group who died due to treatment-related adverse events. Interpretation: Based on a statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin without any new safety signals, pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin could be a new treatment option for patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable biliary tract cancer.

Patients with diverse clinical characteristics receive lenvatinib treatment in clinical practice. Thus, it is crucial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of lenvatinib in real-world clinical settings. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the real-world safety and effectiveness of lenvatinib for uHCC in clinical practice in Japan. Patients and Methods: Between July 2018 and January 2019, patients with uHCC who were administered lenvatinib for the first time were enrolled in this prospective, multicenter, observational post-marketing study (NCT03663114). Patients were orally administered lenvatinib and followed up for 12 months. For safety, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were evaluated. For effectiveness, the objective response rate (ORR) was calculated to evaluate tumor response. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Results: Data of 703 patients (median age, 73 years; 80.2% males) were analyzed. The median (range) treatment duration was 25.3 (0.3–68.9) weeks. The mean ± standard deviation initial dose was 7.37 ± 1.65 mg in patients with body weight < 60 kg and 10.43 ± 2.49 mg in those with body weight ≥ 60 kg. ADRs (any grade) were reported in 84.9% of the patients, with Grade ≥ 3 ADRs reported in 42.5% of the patients. The most common ADRs (> 10%) were decreased appetite, fatigue, hypertension, proteinuria, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, hypothyroidism, and diarrhea. The median OS of the 703 patients was 498.0 days. In 494 patients assessed using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), the ORR was 39.5% (95% confidence interval: 35.1–43.9%). Patients with better liver or renal function at baseline achieved significantly higher ORR than those with worse liver or renal function. Conclusions: In patients with uHCC in real-world clinical practice in Japan, treatment with lenvatinib was generally well tolerated, and no new safety concerns were identified. The ORR and median OS were similar to or better than the results of the Japanese subset of the global Phase III REFLECT trial. Our results demonstrated that clinically meaningful treatment responses were achieved with lenvatinib in real-world clinical practice.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03663114)",,,L2020952850,10.1007/s40801-022-00348-w

Methods: One hundred patients with unresectable HCC initiated therapy with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab at our centre between January 2020 and March 2022. The control cohort consisted of 80 patients with advanced HCC who received either sorafenib (n = 43) or lenvatinib (n = 37) as systemic treatment. Results: Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly longer within the atezolizumab/bevacizumab group and comparable to phase III data. The benefits in terms of increased objective response rate (ORR), OS and PFS were consistent across subgroups, including non-viral HCC (58%). The ROC-optimised neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) cut-off of 3.20 was the strongest independent predictor of ORR and PFS. In patients with advanced cirrhosis Child–Pugh B, liver function was significantly better preserved with immunotherapy. Patients with Child–Pugh B cirrhosis showed similar ORR but shorter OS and PFS compared to patients with preserved liver function.

Thermal ablation has the advantages of being equivalent to surgical resection, minimally invasive, low cost and significantly reducing hospital stay. Therefore, it is recommended as one of the first-line radical treatment for early HCC. However, with the deepening of research on early HCC, more and more studies have found that not all patients with early HCC can obtain similar efficacy after radical thermal ablation, which may be related to the heterogeneity of HCC. Previous studies have shown that inflammation and immunity play an extremely important role in the prognostic heterogeneity of patients with HCC. Therefore, the inflammatory response and immune status of patients may be closely related to the efficacy of early HCC after curative thermal ablation. This article elaborates the mechanism of high inflammatory response and poor immune status in the poor prognosis after radical thermal ablation of early HCC, and clarifies the population who may benefit from adjuvant therapy after radical thermal ablation in patients with early HCC, which provides a new idea for the precise adjuvant treatment after radical ablation of early HCC in the future.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03383458, NCT03867084)",,37121111,L2024154235,10.1016/j.intimp.2023.110228

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) provide insight into the patient's subjective experience with disease and treatment. This study evaluated the PROs among the advanced HCC patients treated with first-line systemic therapy. Methods: EMBASE® and MEDLINE® were searched for English language articles published from inception to December 2022 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating PROs in advanced HCC. The risk of bias assessment was performed using Cochrane’s RoB-2 tool. Results: Four phase III, open-label RCTs were included (IMbrave150, REFLECT, CheckMate 459, and HIMALAYA). The HCC patients were recruited globally across multiple centers in all RCTs. Three general (EORTC-QLQ C30, EQ-VAS, EQ-5D index) and two disease-specific (EORTC QLQ-HCC18, FACT-Hep) instruments were utilized to evaluate PROs among advanced HCC patients. The interventions assessed were atezolizumab + bevacizumab, tremelimumab + durvalumab (STRIDE regimen), lenvatinib, nivolumab, durvalumab and sorafenib. Compared to sorafenib, atezolizumab + bevacizumab, STRIDE regimen, and lenvatinib reduced the risk of deterioration on EORTC QLQ-C30 generic cancer symptom scales such as fatigue, pain, diarrhea, appetite loss, nausea, and vomiting. Atezolizumab + bevacizumab also reduced the risk of deterioration on symptom scales (dyspnoea and insomnia) and functioning (emotional, social, and cognitive). Further, atezolizumab + bevacizumab, and lenvatinib reduced the risk of deterioration on disease-symptom scales (body image and nutrition) compared to sorafenib. Atezolizumab + bevacizumab was associated with a reduced risk of deterioration on the HCC18 disease-specific symptom scale (fatigue, pain, abdominal swelling). Compared with sorafenib, nivolumab was associated with a reduced risk of deterioration on all disease-specific functioning and symptom scales of FACT-Hep (total, physical well-being, functional well-being, and hepatobiliary cancer). Conclusions: Treatment of advanced HCC requires consideration of HRQOL.

Results: In total, 1171 participants were randomised to STRIDE (n=393), durvalumab (n=389) or sorafenib (n=389); median (95% CI) duration of follow-up for the OS analysis in all participants was 49.12 (46.95–50.17), 48.46 (46.82–49.81) and 47.31 (45.08–49.15) months, respectively. The OS HR (95% CI) for STRIDE versus sorafenib was 0.78 (0.67–0.92) and consistent with the primary analysis. The OS rates at 36 months for STRIDE (30.7%) and sorafenib (19.8%) were consistent with the primary analysis. The 48-month OS rate remained higher for STRIDE (25.2%) than for sorafenib (15.1%). Serious TRAEs (including death) occurred in 17.5% of participants treated with STRIDE and 9.6% of participants treated with sorafenib, with no new events occurring after the primary analysis for STRIDE (17.5%). Durvalumab OS noninferiority to sorafenib and safety was consistent with the primary analysis. Baseline demographics, clinical characteristics and subsequent therapies, including percentage of participants rechallenged with tremelimumab, for LTS in the STRIDE arm were generally consistent with the full analysis set, suggesting that long-term survival benefit was not driven by any particular subgroup of participants. Conclusions: These data reinforce the sustained, long-term OS benefit of STRIDE versus sorafenib, demonstrating unprecedented 3- and 4-year OS rates and the longest follow-up to date in phase 3 studies in uHCC. The STRIDE regimen maintained a tolerable yet differentiated safety profile from other current uHCC therapies, with no new serious safety events. These results continue to support the benefits of STRIDE in a diverse population reflective of uHCC globally. Clinical trial identification: NCT03298451.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2023","2023","34",,"S167","S168","1 Jun 2023","Background: HCC is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers globally, with an increasing number of patients affected in the ≥65 years age group. In the phase 3, open-label RATIONALE-301 trial (NCT03412773), tislelizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, showed non-inferior overall survival (OS) vs sorafenib (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71, 1.02) and a favorable safety profile in first-line treatment of patients with unresectable HCC. Here, we present results from the subgroup of patients aged ≥65 years in RATIONALE-301. Methods: Systemic therapy-naïve adults with histologically confirmed HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] Stage C or Stage B that was not amenable to/progressed after loco-regional therapy, Child-Pugh A), with ≥1 measurable lesion (RECIST v1.1) and an ECOG PS ≤1 were randomized (1:1) to tislelizumab (200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) or sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal. The primary endpoint was OS; secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent review committee, and safety. Results: In total, 255 of the 674 randomized patients were in the ≥65 years subgroup (tislelizumab: n=134, sorafenib: n=121), with median (m) age of 71.0 years (range 65-86). At data cutoff (July 11, 2022), median survival follow-up was 38.9 months in the tislelizumab arm vs 39.9 months in the sorafenib arm. The majority of patients in the ≥65 years subgroup were enrolled in Europe/USA and Japan (66.3% vs 36.9%), had less advanced disease (BCLC Stage B: 33.3% vs 22.3%; Stage C: 66.7% vs 77.7%; extrahepatic spread: 51.4% vs 61.9%; distant metastases: 49.0% vs 58.5%), more satisfactory performance status (ECOG PS 0: 61.2% vs 54.0%), and fewer viral infections (uninfected: 41.6 % vs 24.0%) vs the overall population, respectively. Patients in the ≥65 years subgroup had a numerically longer mOS (18.2 months [95% CI: 11.6, 24.2] vs 14.2 months [95% CI: 10.5, 19.2]) in the tislelizumab vs sorafenib arm, respectively; mOS in the ≥65 years subgroup was longer than in the overall population (15.9 months [95% CI: 13.2, 19.7] vs 14.1 months [95% CI: 12.6, 17.4]) in the tislelizumab arm only. Patients in the ≥65 years subgroup had a higher confirmed ORR (18.7% vs 4.1%; odds ratio 5.4 [95% CI: 2.0, 14.7]) and shorter mPFS (3.1 months [95% CI: 2.1, 4.2] vs 3.9 months [95% CI: 2.3, 5.4]) in the tislelizumab vs sorafenib arm, respectively. Similar to the overall population, tislelizumab-treated patients in the ≥65 years subgroup experienced lower incidences of ≥grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (46.6% vs 62.5%) and ≥grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (20.3% vs 52.5%) vs sorafenib-treated patients. Conclusions: In the subgroup of patients aged ≥65 years in the RATIONALE-301 trial, tislelizumab demonstrated numerically longer mOS and a higher ORR vs sorafenib; the longer mOS observed with tislelizumab in this subgroup vs the overall population could be attributed to regional imbalances and more favorable baseline characteristics observed in the subgroup. Tislelizumab showed a favorable safety profile vs sorafenib in the ≥65 years subgroup, consistent with the overall population. Clinical trial identification: NCT03412773.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2023","2023","34",,"S34",,"1 Jun 2023","Background: AMETHISTA is a prospective, open-label, single-arm, phase IIIb trial ongoing at 21 Italian centres that evaluates the safety of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An interim analysis has been conducted approximately at one year from the end of enrolment. Methods: The trial included patients with histologically confirmed HCC not amenable to surgery and/or locoregional therapies, no previous systemic therapy for HCC, ECOG PS 0-1, Child Pugh class A. If present, varices were to be treated per local standard of care prior to enrolment. Atezolizumab 1200 mg/bevacizumab 15 mg/kg were given Q3W until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit. The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of grade (G) 3-5 (NCI CTCAE v.5) bleedings/haemorrhages, secondary endpoints were OS, PFS, ORR. Results: 152 patients were enrolled and 149 (118 males, median age 69 years) were treated. Most patients had ECOG PS 0 (84.6%), BCLC stage C (77.9%) and mALBI grade 1 (51.7%). Overall, 62 patients (41.6%) had extrahepatic spread, 29 (19.5%) had macrovascular invasion. 54 patients (36.2%) had received prior loco-regional therapy. Varices were present in 32 (21.5%) patients and were treated in 11 (7.4 %), with banding in 3 (2%), non-cardioselective beta-blockers in 7 (4.7%), not specified in 1 (0.7%). After a median follow-up of 13.4 months, 50 patients (32.9% of the enrolled) were still on treatment and 99 (65.1%) permanently discontinued treatment (due to progressive disease in 57, 37.5%). 63 patients (41.5%) discontinued the study (mainly due to death in 49 patients, and to consent withdrawal in 7) and 36 (23.7%) were in follow-up. The median exposure to atezolizumab and bevacizumab was 8.3 and 7.3 months (12.0 and 11.0 cycles), respectively. 44 patients (29.5%) permanently discontinued any treatment due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). A total of 21 G3-5 bleeding/haemorrhage events occurred in 17 patients (11.4%), mainly involving the gastrointestinal tract (8.7%). G5 bleedings/haemorrhages occurred in 3 patients (2.0%), related to bevacizumab in 2 and unrelated to any study drugs in 1. The mean (SD) time to onset and time to resolution of the first bleeding/haemorrhage event was 141.3 (111.97) days (median 100.0 days, range 5-442 days) and 20.4 (25.38) days (median 11.0 days, range 1-113 days), respectively. Fatal TEAEs occurred in 14 patients (9.4%), related to bevacizumab in 3 (2.0%). Serious TEAEs were reported in 53 patients (35.6%), related to any treatment component in 27 (18.1%). Treatment-related TEAEs (TRAEs) were reported in 106 patients (71.1%), related to atezolizumab in 86 (57.7%), to bevacizumab in 91 (61.1%) and to both in 51 (34.2%). The most common TREAEs were hypertension (39 patients, 26.2%), pruritus (17 patients, 11.4%) and asthenia (16 patients, 10.7%). Median OS was 18.23 months (95% CI, 15.38-NE), median PFS was 8.51 months (95% CI, 7.52-11.24), ORR was 26.9%. Conclusions: At a median follow up of 13.4 months, in a population of patients with unresectable HCC comparable to clinical practice, these interim analysis results were consistent with the known safety and efficacy profile of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.

"P-282 Atezolizumab and bevacizumab in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma – a single-center experience","Adžić G., Prejac J., Librenjak N., Kekez D., Goršić I., Pleština S.","Annals of Oncology (2023) 34 Supplement 1 (S115). Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2023","2023","34",,"S115",,"1 Jun 2023","Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the predominant subtype of primary liver cancer. It ranks third among the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality globally. For over a decade, sorafenib was the only available treatment in advanced HCC. The phase III clinical trial IMbrave 150 demonstrated that the use of atezolizumab with bevacizumab was superior to sorafenib in both progression-free (PFS) survival and overall survival (OS). We present real-world data from a single center in patients with advanced HCC treated with this combination. Methods: 32 patients who received atezolizumab and bevacizumab as first-line treatment for advanced HCC between July 2021 and March 2023 in our institution were retrospectively identified. Patient characteristics, tumor response rates, PFS, and OS were evaluated. OS was defined as the time from the start of treatment until death or the last follow-up visit, and PFS as the time from the start of treatment until failure of the first-line treatment. Survival (OS and PFS) was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Patients were censored with the last follow-up until March 1 st, 2023. Results: Out of 32 patients, 28 were male (84.5%). The median age at the start of treatment was 72 years and 20 patients had cirrhosis (62.5%). In 11 patients (34%) alcohol was identified as the main etiological factor, in 8 patients (25%) hepatitis virus infection, in 7 patients non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (21.9%) while the etiology was unknown in other patients. 8 patients (25%) were classified as BCLC B, while 24 patients (75%) were classified as BCLC C. Out of patients who were radiologically evaluated 9.5% had complete remission as the best response, 28.5% had partial remission, 23.8% had stable disease whereas 38.2% had disease progression which resulted in an objective response rate of 38% and a disease control rate of 61.8%. Median PFS was 10.6 months (95% confidence interval 1.2-20.1 months), while median OS was not reached, although a clear trend towards survival outcomes achieved in IMbrave 150 was evident. Conclusions: Although our institution's data is not yet mature enough, it demonstrates that the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab is effective as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced HCC in the real-world setting. Further research is warranted to identify tissue or blood-based biomarkers of response to atezolizumab and bevacizumab therapy. This would help select the population of patients with the most benefit from this drug combination. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors. Funding: Has not received any funding.

"P-120 Efficacy of systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma based on etiology: A systematic review and network meta-analysis","Wong C., Chan K., Chiang C.","Annals of Oncology (2023) 34 Supplement 1 (S57). Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2023","2023","34",,"S57",,"1 Jun 2023","Background: Emerging data suggested the efficacy of systemic therapy regimen of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is affected by disease etiology. However, robust head-to-head comparative data is lacking, and it is less likely to be examined in prospective manner in the future. Thus, a network meta-analysis is helpful to compare different agents based on etiology across the trials. We aim to evaluate the survival of advanced HCC patients treated with different systemic agents based on etiology. Methods: A total of five international databases were searched for phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We included RCTs published from January 2007 to November 2022 which evaluated HCC patients receiving different systemic treatments in the first-line or refractory setting with data available in either one of the three etiology groups: hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and non-viral etiology. We used random-effect pairwise meta-analysis with pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to quantify the effect of systemic treatments, and frequentist network meta-analysis (NMA) to evaluate comparative effectiveness among systemic treatments based on etiology. P-score was used to rank effectiveness of the treatments. Primary outcome was overall survival (OS), while secondary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Twenty-three RCTs (12 in the first-line setting and 11 in the refractory setting) were included. The 12 trials in the first-line setting encompassed a total of 7776 patients, the 11 trials included in the refractory setting encompassed a total of 4672 patients. For HBV subgroup in the first-line setting, pairwise meta-analysis showed that immunotherapy (pooled HR: 0.67, 95% CI, 0.59-0.76) was significantly more effective than targeted therapy (pooled HR: 0.93, 95% CI, 0.85-1.02) in improving OS (p < 0.0001). NMA indicated that Carbozantinib+atezolizumab (P-score: 90%), sintilimab+IBI305 (P-score: 89%), and atezolizumab+bevacizumab (P-score: 88%) yielded the best OS benefits. In the refractory setting, both immunotherapy (HR: 0.57, 95% CI, 0.35-0.93) and targeted therapy (pooled HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65-0.83) were effective in improving OS; regorafenib (P-score: 81%) and pembrolizumab (P-score: 79%) were the most effective regimen. For patients with HCV, pairwise meta-analysis showed that there was a trend of improved OS in immunotherapy (pooled HR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.55-1.16) than targeted therapy (pooled HR: 1.17, 95% CI, 0.92-1.48) (p=0.09) in first-line setting, while no significant difference was detected in refractory setting. Atezolizumab + bevacizumab (P-score: 99%) was the superior first-line regimen, while regorafenib (P-score: 71%) was the preferred second-line regimen. For patients with non-viral etiology, there is no significant OS difference between immunotherapy and targeted therapy in both first-line (p=1.00) and refractory patients (p=0.42). Similar trends were found in the analyses of PFS in patients with HBV or HCV infection. However, targeted therapy was significantly more effective than immunotherapy in the non-viral patients to improve PFS in both first-line (p=0.02) and refractory patients (p=0.03). Conclusions: The systematic review and NMA of 23 RCTs found that immunotherapies may be more effective in viral etiologies. However, the best regimen in non-viral etiology is less conclusive.

After completing DB treatment, all patients were eligible to receive open-label (OL) TAF through week 384 (year 8). Here we present the final safety results at year 8. Method: In a pooled analysis, treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), discontinuations, and laboratory abnormalities were assessed in patients who received OLTAF. Changes from baseline in estimated GFR (by Cockcroft-Gault; eGFR(CG)) and changes in hip and spine bone mineral density (BMD) by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were assessed. Results: Of 1298 randomized and treated patients, 1157 (89%; 775 TAF; 382 TDF) entered the OL phase. Overall, 974 (75%) participants completed OL study treatment. The overall incidence of patients experiencing AEswas similar among groups (Table). Rates of Grade 3/ 4 AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation (D/C) were lowand similar among groups. Few Grade 3/4 AEs or SAEs were related to the study drug. Overall, the most common Grade 3/4 lab abnormalities (>2%) were increased amylase (TAF 1.9%, TDF-TAF 2.7%), creatine kinase (TAF 1.4%, TDF-TAF 2.1%), fasting cholesterol (TAF 1.4%, TDF-TAF 2.9%), fasting LDL (TAF 5.9%, TDF-TAF 8.0%), and urine glucose (TAF 5.2%, TDF-TAF 2.7%). After experiencing declines in eGFR(CG)and hip/spine BMD with TDF treatment in the DB phase, renal and bone outcomes improved following the switch to OL TAF with minimal change through year 8.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2023","2023","78",,"S598","S599","1 Jun 2023","Background and aims: Cabozantinib (CAB) has been used as 2(nd) or later-line worldwide in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (u-HCC). In the phase III study of CAB (CELESTIAL study), the initial dose of CAB was 60 mg/day, while in the phase III study of the combination of atezolizumab plus CAB (COSMIC312 study), the initial dose of CAB was 40 mg/day. Recently the standard first-line therapy for u-HCC is atezolizumab plus bevacizumab or durvalumab plus tremelimumab. We investigated the clinical impact of relative dose intensity over the first four weeks (4W-RDI) in CAB therapy for u-HCC. Method: A total of 43 u-HCC patients who received CAB between Jan 2021 and Dec 2022 at our institution was included. Tumor assessments in accordance with RECIST ver1.1 were performed using dynamic CT or MRI within 4–8 weeks and every 8–10 weeks thereafter. The 4W-RDI was calculated as the cumulative dose in the initial 4 weeks divided by the standard dose (60 mg/day), and we evaluated its association with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: The median age was 74 (24–87) years, and 33 patients were male. Sixteen patients had HBV (n = 7) or HCV (n = 9) infection, and 30 patients were Child-Pugh A. BCLC stage A/B/C were 0/14/29 patients, and 38 patients (88%) were previously treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. CAB was administered as 2nd or 3rd-line in 25 and 4(th) or later-line in 18 patients. The median follow-up duration was 6.8 months, and the median duration of CAB was 2.7 months. The initial dose of CAB was 60 mg (n = 14), 40 mg (n = 13), and 20 mg/day or less (n = 16). The median PFS and OS were 4.1 and 16.2 months. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) was 12.1% and 84.8%. The median 4W-RDI was 33%, and there was no significant difference in PFS and OS between 4W-RDI<40% (n = 27) and ≥40% (n = 16) (3.1 vs. 4.4 months, p = 0.25 and 19.0 vs. 10.2 months, p = 0.78). Adverse events due to CAB were observed in all patients, requiring dose reduction in 35 patients (81%) and interruption of CAB in 32 patients (74%). The rate of molecular targeted therapies after CAB was 62.5%. In a multivariate analysis, the pretreatment ALBI score (HR 7.57, 95% CI 2.09–27.5, P = 0.002)was the only significant factor associated with OS. The 4W-RDI of CAB and treatment -line (CAB as 4–6 line) were not associated with OS. The median OS of the patients who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab before CAB was 19.1 months. Conclusion: Maintaining a high 4W-RDI of CAB was not associated with OS and PFS in real-world practice. Prior atezolizumab plus bevacizumab would contribute to prolonged survival in CAB therapy for u-HCC.",,,,L2025893018,10.1016/S0168-8278(23)01410-1

However, direct comparison with other combination treatments including immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) plus tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or anti-CTLA4 are lacking. The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) is to indirectly compare the efficacy and the safety of first-line systemic treatments. Method: Literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases was conducted up to October, 2022. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing TKIs, including Sorafenib and Lenvatinib, or ICIs reporting overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were included. Individual survival data were extracted from OS and PFS curves to calculate restricted mean survival time (RMST). A Bayesian NMA was performed to compare treatments in terms of efficacy (15- and 30-month OS, 6-month PFS) and safety, represented by grade ≥ 3 (severe) adverse events (SAEs). The incremental safety-effectiveness ratio (ISER) as measure of net health benefit was calculated as the difference in probability of SAEs divided by difference in survival between the 2 most effective treatments. Results: Nine RCTs enrolling 6600 patients were included. Atezolizumab+bevacizumab showed the highest probability (88%) of being the best in 30-month OS. Pembrolizumab+lenvatinib and Lenvatinib showed the highest probability (93% and 86%, respectively) of being the best in terms of PFS. ICI monotherapies were the most safe combination. At a willingness-to-risk threshold of 10% of SAEs for month-year gained, atezolizumab+bevacizumab was favored in 76% of cases, while at a threshold of 30% of SAEs for month-year gained, pembrolizumab+lenvatinib was favored in 72% of cases. Conclusion: Atezolizumab plus Bevacizumab is the preferred option in unfit patients with high tumor burden, while Lenvatinib with or without Pembrolizumab could be preferred for fit patients with less advanced vascular tumor spread [Figure presented]",,,,L2025893193,10.1016/S0168-8278(23)01400-9

As liver function is a known predictor of survival in pts with HCC, we evaluated baseline liver function and its impact on OS and safety in pts enrolled in RATIONALE-301. Method: Systemic therapy-naïve adults with histologically confirmed HCC were randomized (1:1) to receive TIS (200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) or SOR (400 mg orally twice daily) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal. The primary end point was OS. In this exploratory analysis, OS and safety were assessed by Child-Pugh score (CPS; 5 vs 6) and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade (1 vs 2).

However, evidence on efficacy and safety of the novel treatment standard in patients with prior exposure to systemic treatment is scarce. Up to now, global positive phase 3 clinical trials for second line treatments are limited to regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab following sorafenib treatment. The aim of this global, multi-center, observational study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of AB in patients after previous systemic therapy. Method: We screened our global, multi-center, prospectively maintained registry database for patients who received any systemic therapy before AB. Primary end point was OS, secondary end points were time-to-progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety (rate and severity of adverse events). Results: Among 493 patients who received AB for unresectable HCC, 61 patients received prior systemic therapy and were included in this analysis. Median age of the study population was 66 years, with 91.8% males. Predominant risk factors for HCC were viral hepatitis (59%) and alcohol (23%).

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2023","2023","78",,"S765","S766","1 Jun 2023","Background and aims: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents a major health burden worldwide. Upon injury, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) secreted by hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, and Kupffer cells trigger the recruitment of C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) expressing circulating monocytes that significantly contribute to the macrophage compartment of the liver and liver inflammation that further progresses to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. CCR2 antagonism by Cenicriviroc (CVC), a small molecule CCR2/CCR5 dual inhibitor, showed reduction in macrophage/monocyte recruitment in vitro and in vivo in acute and chronic mouse models. Despite promising results in the phase 2b (Centaur) trial, CVC failed in phase 3 (Aurora) trial due to the lack of efficacy possibly because of poor pharmacokinetic profile and lack of specificity. Using in silico modelling approach, we have designed an antagonizing peptide against CCR2 to inhibit monocyte recruitment and liver inflammation. Our previous data has shown that AP2 significantly attenuated CCL2-induced macrophage/monocyte infiltration in vitro and in vivo in an acute carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury mouse model. Here, in this study, we investigate the effects of AP2 in a chronic NASH mouse model. Method:We established a NASH mouse model by feeding mice with western diet (21.1% fat, 41% sucrose and 1.25% cholesterol) supplemented with high sugar solution (23.1 g/L d-fructose and 18.9 g/L dglucose), combined with low weekly doses of CCl4 for 12weeks. After 8 weeks, mice were treated intraperitoneally with 1 μmol/kg AP2 or CVC (2x per day) for 4 weeks. To assess intrahepatic monocyte infiltration in vivo, liver tissues were mechanically dissociated using Tissue Grinder, and cell population characterized by CD11b and F4/80 expression levels were analyzed using flow cytometry. Effects of AP2 and CVC on disease pathogenesis (steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis) were assessed using immunohistochemistry, RNA-sequencing, and plasma analysis. Results: Flow cytometric analysis revealed a decrease in intrahepatic monocytes-derived macrophages in AP2 and CVC treated mice. Immunohistochemical analysis evidenced decreased steatosis (oilred- O), inflammation (F4/80) and fibrosis (Collagen-I) in AP2 (and CVC) treated mice. AP2 and CVC treatment significantly inhibited the total plasma levels of AST, ALT, cholesterol and triglycerides. RNA sequencing analysis showed an improved NASH specific gene expression profiles in AP2 and CVC treated animals. CVC-treated mice showed reduced body weight on treatment and higher mortality compared with AP2. Conclusion: Our CCR2 antagonizing peptide successfully inhibited intrahepatic monocyte/macrophage infiltration and ameliorated liver disease progression in vivo, in a chronic NASH mouse model.

In pts randomized to SOR (n = 332), 74.7% and 25.3% had a CPS of 5 and 6, respectively, and 68.1% and 29.5% had an ALBI grade 1 and 2, respectively. At data cutoff (July 11, 2022; minimum study follow-up 33 mo), mOS was similar in pts treated with TIS and SOR, and numerically longer in pts with CPS 5 vs 6, and ALBI grade 1 vs 2, regardless of treatment arm (Table). Incidence of any grade and grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were lower in pts treated with TIS versus SOR across CPS and ALBI grades (Table). Conclusion: Survival was similar between arms, and TIS showed a favorable safety profile compared with SOR, regardless of CPS or ALBI grade, supporting the primary analysis. Pts with CPS 6 and ALBI grade 2 had poorer mOS than those with CPS 5 and ALBI grade 1, regardless of treatment arm, affirming that pts with better liver function have improved outcomes.

In RATIONALE-301 (NCT03412773) TIS was non-inferior to sorafenib (SOR) for overall survival (OS) as first-line treatment of patients (pts) with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); OS superiority vs SOR was not met. We evaluated the association of response with survival in pts from the RATIONALE-301 study. Method: In this phase 3, open-label study, systemic therapy-naïve adult pts with histologically confirmed Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage B/C HCC were randomized (1:1) to receive TIS (200 mg intravenous every 3 weeks) or SOR (400 mg orally twice daily) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal. The primary end point was OS; secondary efficacy end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and best overall response (BOR; per RECIST v1.1) by blinded independent reviewcommittee.We assessed OS and PFS according to BOR (complete response [CR] vs partial response [PR] vs stable disease [SD] vs progressive disease [PD]). Limitation of this analysis is related to its retrospective nature. Results: Overall, 674 pts were randomized (TIS: n = 342; SOR: n = 332).

However, evidence on efficacy and safety of the novel treatment standard in patients with prior exposure to systemic treatment is scarce. Up to now, global positive phase 3 clinical trials for second line treatments are limited to regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab following sorafenib treatment. The aim of this global, multi-center, observational study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of AB in patients after previous systemic therapy. Method: We screened our global, multi-center, prospectively maintained registry database for patients who received any systemic therapy before AB. Primary end point was OS, secondary end points were time-to-progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety (rate and severity of adverse events). Results: Among 493 patients who received AB for unresectable HCC, 61 patients received prior systemic therapy and were included in this analysis. Median age of the study population was 66 years, with 91.8% males. Predominant risk factors for HCC were viral hepatitis (59%) and alcohol (23%).

However, direct comparison with other combination treatments including immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) plus tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or anti-CTLA4 are lacking. The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) is to indirectly compare the efficacy and the safety of first-line systemic treatments. Method: Literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases was conducted up to October, 2022. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing TKIs, including Sorafenib and Lenvatinib, or ICIs reporting overall survival (OS) and progressionfree survival (PFS) were included. Individual survival data were extracted from OS and PFS curves to calculate restricted mean survival time (RMST). A Bayesian NMA was performed to compare treatments in terms of efficacy (15- and 30-month OS, 6-month PFS) and safety, represented by grade ≥ 3 (severe) adverse events (SAEs). The incremental safety-effectiveness ratio (ISER) as measure of net health benefit was calculated as the difference in probability of SAEs divided by difference in survival between the 2 most effective treatments. Results: Nine RCTs enrolling 6600 patients were included. Atezolizumab+bevacizumab showed the highest probability (88%) of being the best in 30-month OS. Pembrolizumab+lenvatinib and Lenvatinib showed the highest probability (93% and 86%, respectively) of being the best in terms of PFS. ICI monotherapies were the most safe combination.

In the phase III study of CAB (CELESTIAL study), the initial dose of CAB was 60 mg/day, while in the phase III study of the combination of atezolizumab plus CAB (COSMIC312 study), the initial dose of CAB was 40 mg/day. Recently the standard first-line therapy for u-HCC is atezolizumab plus bevacizumab or durvalumab plus tremelimumab. We investigated the clinical impact of relative dose intensity over the first four weeks (4W-RDI) in CAB therapy for u-HCC. Method: A total of 43 u-HCC patients who received CAB between Jan 2021 and Dec 2022 at our institution was included. Tumor assessments in accordance with RECIST ver1.1 were performed using dynamic CT or MRI within 4–8 weeks and every 8–10 weeks thereafter. The 4W-RDI was calculated as the cumulative dose in the initial 4 weeks divided by the standard dose (60 mg/day), andwe evaluated its association with overall survival (OS) and progressionfree survival (PFS). Results: The median age was 74 (24–87) years, and 33 patients were male. Sixteen patients had HBV (n = 7) or HCV (n = 9) infection, and 30 patients were Child-Pugh A. BCLC stage A/B/C were 0/14/29 patients, and 38 patients (88%) were previously treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. CAB was administered as 2nd or 3rd-line in 25 and 4(th) or later-line in 18 patients. The median follow-up duration was 6.8 months, and the median duration of CAB was 2.7 months. The initial dose of CAB was 60 mg (n = 14), 40 mg (n = 13), and 20 mg/day or less (n = 16). The median PFS and OS were 4.1 and 16.2 months. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) was 12.1% and 84.8%. The median 4W-RDI was 33%, and there was no significant difference in PFS and OS between 4W-RDI<40% (n = 27) and ≥40% (n = 16) (3.1 vs. 4.4 months, p = 0.25 and 19.0 vs. 10.2 months, p = 0.78). Adverse events due to CAB were observed in all patients, requiring dose reduction in 35 patients (81%) and interruption of CAB in 32 patients (74%). The rate of molecular targeted therapies after CAB was 62.5%. In a multivariate analysis, the pretreatment ALBI score (HR 7.57, 95% CI 2.09–27.5, P = 0.002)was the only significant factor associated with OS. The 4W-RDI of CAB and treatment -line (CAB as 4–6 line) were not associated with OS. The median OS of the patients who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab before CAB was 19.1 months. Conclusion: Maintaining a high 4W-RDI of CAB was not associated with OS and PFS in real-world practice.

"Antagonism of C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) using a novel in silico designed peptide attenuates macrophage infiltration and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in vivo","Geervliet E., Weiskirchen R., Bansal R.","Journal of Hepatology (2023) 78 Supplement 1 (764-765). Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2023","2023","78",,"764","765","1 Jun 2023","Background and aims: Non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents a major health burden worldwide. Upon injury, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) secreted by hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, and Kupffer cells trigger the recruitment of C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) expressing circulating monocytes that significantly contribute to the macrophage compartment of the liver and liver inflammation that further progresses to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. CCR2 antagonism by Cenicriviroc (CVC), a small molecule CCR2/CCR5 dual inhibitor, showed reduction in macrophage/monocyte recruitment in vitro and in vivo in acute and chronic mouse models. Despite promising results in the phase 2b (Centaur) trial, CVC failed in phase 3 (Aurora) trial due to the lack of efficacy possibly because of poor pharmacokinetic profile and lack of specificity. Using in silico modelling approach, we have designed an antagonizing peptide against CCR2 to inhibit monocyte recruitment and liver inflammation. Our previous data has shown that AP2 significantly attenuated CCL2-induced macrophage/monocyte infiltration in vitro and in vivo in an acute carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury mouse model. Here, in this study, we investigate the effects of AP2 in a chronic NASH mouse model. Method:We established a NASH mouse model by feeding mice with western diet (21.1% fat, 41% sucrose and 1.25% cholesterol) supplemented with high sugar solution (23.1 g/L d-fructose and 18.9 g/L dglucose), combined with lowweekly doses of CCl4 for 12weeks. After 8 weeks, mice were treated intraperitoneally with 1 μmol/kg AP2 or CVC (2x per day) for 4 weeks. To assess intrahepatic monocyte infiltration in vivo, liver tissues were mechanically dissociated using Tissue Grinder, and cell population characterized by CD11b and F4/80 expression levels were analyzed using flow cytometry. Effects of AP2 and CVC on disease pathogenesis (steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis) were assessed using immunohistochemistry, RNA-sequencing, and plasma analysis. Results: Flow cytometric analysis revealed a decrease in intrahepatic monocytes-derived macrophages in AP2 and CVC treated mice. Immunohistochemical analysis evidenced decreased steatosis (oilred-O), inflammation (F4/80) and fibrosis (Collagen-I) in AP2 (and CVC) treated mice. AP2 and CVC treatment significantly inhibited the total plasma levels of AST, ALT, cholesterol and triglycerides. RNA sequencing analysis showed an improved NASH specific gene expression profiles in AP2 and CVC treated animals. CVC-treated mice showed reduced body weight on treatment and higher mortality compared with AP2. Conclusion: Our CCR2 antagonizing peptide successfully inhibited intrahepatic monocyte/macrophage infiltration and ameliorated liver disease progression in vivo, in a chronic NASH mouse model.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2023","2023","46","6","S46",,"1 Jun 2023","Background: TACE is a widely used local therapy for patients with unresectable HCC. However, recurrence rates after initial TACE are high and residual disease is common. It is unknown if other local therapies, such as SBRT, would be preferable in treating residual or recurrent HCC after initial TACE. Objectives: We aimed to determine the freedom from local progression (FFLP) of TACE vs SABR in patients with persistent HCC after TACE. Methods: In this randomized, international phase III study, we randomly assigned patients (1:1) with residual or recurrent HCC on CT or MRI after initial TACE to receive either repeat TACE or SBRT. Randomization was done with a randomized block design software. The use of 4-dimensional CT was strongly recommended, but not required, and the dose of radiation therapy was 45 Gy in 3 fractions if normal tissue constraints could be met, or else 40-50 Gy in 5 fractions was allowed. The target accrual was 80 patients per arm for a total of 160 patients to provide at least 90% power in a two-sided log rank test of detecting a 30% difference in the primary outcome of FFLP at 12 months of the two groups with alpha level of 0.05, but the trial was closed prematurely due to slow accrual. Results: Between February 2016 and December 2019, a total number of 13 patients from 2 centers were registered with 7 patients randomized to receive SBRT and 6 patients randomized to repeat TACE. The median age was 66 years (range 54.7-78.0 y), and 4 patients were female (31%) and 9 were male (69%). Two patients in the SBRT arm did not undergo planned treatment due to multifocal disease seen on imaging, and three patients in the TACE arm did not undergo planned treatment due to concern of portal vein thrombosis, stenosis of the hepatic artery, or distant disease progression. Of the patients who were treated per protocol, one patient in the TACE arm and two patients in the SBRT arm had multifocal disease, and all patients had and ECOG score of 0-1. The median size of the treated tumor was 1.8 cm in the TACE arm and 2.8 cm in the SBRT arm. None of the patients who were treated per protocol experienced local progression, and the median follow-up time for patients who received SBRT and TACE was 20.8 months and 36.2 months, respectively. Two patients experienced grade 3 hematologic toxicities, one from each arm. One patient experienced grade 3 portal hypertension in the SBRT arm and another patient experienced grade 2 cholecystitis in the SBRT arm. Conclusions: Although randomized trials are needed to best evaluate the multitude of locoregional therapies available for HCC, there remains multiple barriers to patient accrual. Further efforts are needed towards increasing patient accessibility to and provider awareness of available trials, and gaining support of all treating physicians is critical for successive trials of locoregional therapies.",,,,L641866294,10.1097/COC.0000000000001009

Any grade imAEs, Grade 3 or 4 imAEs, and imAEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 139 (35.8%), 49 (12.6%), and 22 (5.7%) pts, respectively for STRIDE and 64 (16.5%), 25 (6.4%), and 10 (2.6%) pts, respectively for D. imAEs requiring high-dose steroids (≥40 mg prednisone or equivalent daily) occurred in 78 (20.1%) pts for STRIDE and 37 (9.5%) pts for D. An improvement in OS was seen with STRIDE in pts with imAEs vs pts without (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.95). OS rates at 6, 12, and 24 months (mo) were higher for STRIDE in pts with imAEs vs pts without. The association between imAEs and OS was less clear for D and may be limited by small pt number. In a landmark analysis of pts with vs without imAEs within 6 mo of STRIDE (n=307) or D (n=287), OS HRs (95% CIs) were 0.65 (0.47-0.90) and 1.39 (0.95-2.04), respectively. Conclusions: In HIMALAYA, imAEs with STRIDE or D were manageable and generally low grade. In this exploratory analysis, the occurrence of imAEs was associated with improved OS for STRIDE, generally consistent with findings for other ICIs.

The combination immunotherapy including dual immune checkpoint inhibitors or combined with anti-VEGF agents have become a trend, but not fully evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate and compare distinct combination immunotherapy on efficacy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane databases were systematically searched from inception to January 31, 2022. The primary endpoints were overall objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), six-month progression-free survival rate (PFSR6m) and one-year overall survival rate (OSR1y). Results: 11 studies with 16 independent cohorts and 3342 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with first-line sorafenib, combination immunotherapy resulted in a significant improvement in ORR (RR, 2.74; 95%CI, 1.55–4.85; p = 0.0006), PFS (HR, 0.57; 95%CI, 0.49–0.65; p<0.0001) and OS (HR, 0.65; 95%CI, 0.52–0.82; p = 0.0002). Based on RECIST 1.1, the pooled ORR, PFSR6m and OSR1y for combination immunotherapy were 24.6% (95%CI: 20.3%-29.6%), 42.0% (95%CI: 34.2%-50.3%) and 61.8% (95%CI: 57.7%-65.7%), respectively.

"Insights From Image Guided Radiation Therapy Credentialing for the NRG Oncology RTOG 1112 Liver Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Trial","Craig T., Xiao Y., McNulty S., Dawson L.A.","Practical Radiation Oncology (2023) 13:3 (239-245). Date of Publication: 1 May 2023","2023","13","3","239","245","1 May 2023","Purpose: NRG Oncology trial RTOG 1112 is a randomized phase 3 study of sorafenib with or without stereotactic body radiation therapy for locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) credentialing is essential for this study because of the high doses, respiratory motion, and variety of delivery technologies. This analysis presents the IGRT credentialing experience. Methods and Materials: Credentialing of volumetric IGRT requires submission of planning and localization images, planning structures, and resulting IGRT shifts for a patient treated according to the study requirements. A study reviewer uses these data to repeat the registrations and compare to the actual clinical registrations. Agreement within 5 mm was considered acceptable for credentialing. Results: Volumetric images of 130 fractions from 42 institutions between June 2013 and January 2018 were reviewed. The median agreement between clinical registrations and study reviewer was 3 mm, with 95% of all fractions within 5 mm. A subanalysis identified a statistically significant difference between the use of low-contrast soft tissue and high-contrast surrogates (eg, implanted fiducial markers, surgical clips, metallic stents) for registration. Soft tissue and high-contrast surrogate registrations both agreed within 3 mm in 50% of fractions. However, soft tissue registrations exceeded 10 mm in 3% of fractions, while no high-contrast surrogate registrations exceeded 5 mm. Conclusions: The RTOG 1112 credentialing experience suggests that most institutions perform liver IGRT with sufficient accuracy to deliver stereotactic body radiation therapy safely, as assessed by expert reviewers. Both soft tissue and high-contrast surrogates appear adequate for consistent registration in most instances; however, some disagreements were observed when using soft-tissue registration targets. The use of high-contrast surrogates appears to reduce the small risk of substantial geographic miss owing to mis-registration in liver IGRT.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01730937)",,36581199,L2022256704,10.1016/j.prro.2022.11.013

We then provide the authors’ current approach to therapy, i.e., “How We Treat HCC”. Promising future directions and important gaps in therapy that persist are finally reviewed. HCC is a highly prevalent cancer worldwide and the incidence is growing due not only to alcoholism, hepatitis B and C, but also to steatohepatitis. HCC, like renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, is a cancer largely resistant to chemotherapy but the advent of anti-angiogenic, targeted and immune therapies have improved survival for all of these cancers. We hope this review will heighten interest in the field of HCC therapies, provide a clear outline of the current data and strategy for treatment, and sensitize readers to new developments that are likely to emerge in the near future.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02715284, NCT03672305)",,,L2023180527,10.3390/cancers15092506

To address this gap, this review provides a detailed analysis of CXCL1’s role in gastrointestinal cancers, including head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)), cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma), and colorectal cancer (colon cancer and rectal cancer). This paper presents the impact of CXCL1 on various molecular cancer processes, such as cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, lymph node metastasis, angiogenesis, recruitment to the tumor microenvironment, and its effect on immune system cells, such as tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN), regulatory T (T(reg)) cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and macrophages. Furthermore, this review discusses the association of CXCL1 with clinical aspects of gastrointestinal cancers, including its correlation with tumor size, cancer grade, tumor–node–metastasis (TNM) stage, and patient prognosis.

The initial introduction of HBV immunoglobulins (HBIG), and then of nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs), considerably improved the survival of HBV/HDV patients post-transplantation, as they helped prevent re-infection of the graft and recurrence of liver disease. Combination therapy with HBIG and NUCs is the primary post-transplant prophylaxis strategy in patients transplanted for HBV- and HDV-related liver disease. However, monotherapy with high-barrier NUCs, such as entecavir and tenofovir, is safe and also effective in some individuals who are at low risk of HBV reactivation.

We performed a network metanalysis of phase III of trials to compare first-line systemic treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma in terms of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate, disease control rate, and incidence of adverse events (AEs). Methods: After performing a literature review from January 2008 to September 2022, we screened 6,329 studies and reviewed 3,009 studies, leading to identification of 15 phase III trials for analysis. We extracted odds ratios for objective response rate and disease control rate, relative risks for AEs, and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for OS and PFS, and used a frequentist network metanalysis, with fixed-effect multivariable meta-regression models to estimate the indirect pooled HRs, odds ratios, relative risks, and corresponding 95% CIs, considering sorafenib as reference. Results: Of 10,820 included patients, 10,444 received active treatment and 376 placebo. Sintilimab + IBI350, camrelizumab + rivoceranib, and atezolizumab + bevacizumab provided the greatest reduction in the risk of death compared with sorafenib, with HRs of 0.57 (95% CI 0.43–0.75), 0.62 (95% CI 0.49–0.79), and 0.66 (95% CI 0.52–0.84), respectively. Considering PFS, camrelizumab + rivoceranib and pembrolizumab + lenvatinib were associated with the greatest reduction in the risk of PFS events compared with sorafenib, with HRs of 0.52 (95% CI 0.41–0.65) and 0.52 (95% CI 0.35–0.77), respectively. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapies carried the lowest risk for all-grade and grade ≥3 AEs. Conclusions: The combinations of ICI + anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, and double ICIs lead to the greatest OS benefit compared with sorafenib, whereas ICI + kinase inhibitor regimens are associated with greater PFS benefit at the cost of higher toxicity rates. Impact and Implications: In the last few years, many different therapies have been studied for patients with primary liver cancer that cannot be treated with surgery. In these cases, anticancer drugs (alone or in combination) are given with the intent to keep the cancer at bay and, ultimately, to prolong survival. Among all the therapies that have been investigated, the combination of immunotherapy (drugs that boost the immune system against the cancer) and anti-angiogenic agents (drugs that act on tumoural vessels) has appeared the best to improve survival. Similarly, the combination of two types of immunotherapies that activate the immune system at different levels has also shown positive results.

Modified albumin-bilirubin (mALBI) grade has been shown as a determinant of survival in HCC patients treated with locoregional and targeted therapy. We aimed to 1) determine whether mALBI prognosticated survival of uHCC patients treated with AB, and 2) identify predictors of outcomes in these patients. Methods: A single-center retrospective study was conducted. We enrolled 74 uHCC patients treated with AB between September 2020 and October 2022. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the Log Rank test. Factors associated with survival were determined using Cox proportional hazard analysis. Results: Of 74 uHCC patients, 59 (79.7%) were male (mean age 59.6 years) and 67 (91%) had cirrhosis. Viral hepatitis B/C infection was the most common etiology of liver disease (n=52, 70.3%). 20 (27%) had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B HCC with extensive tumor involvement. Another 54 (73%) had BCLC stage C disease, of whom 27 (36.5%) and 27 (36.5%) had portal vein invasion and extrahepatic metastasis, respectively. Regarding severity of liver impairment, 63 (85.1%) and 10 (13.5%) had Child-Pugh class A and B cirrhosis; and 39 (52.7%) and 35 (47.3%) had mALBI 1+2a and mALBI 2b+3, respectively. Most (n=52, 70.3%) had prior HCC treatment before AB while 22 (29.7%) received AB as first-line treatment. Median OS and PFS was 14 (95%CI: 4.3-23.7-22.9) and 3.78 months, (95%CI: 2.8-4.74.1-9.4), respectively. The disease control rate was 40.7% (20.3% partial response and 20.3% stable disease) and 59.2% had progressive disease. By univariate analysis, Child-Pugh class and mALBI grade were associated with survival while tumor burden and AFP were not associated with survival. By multivariate analysis adjusted for age and gender, Child-Pugh class and mALBI grade remained independently associated with survival, with adjusted hazard ratios (95%CI) of 3.48 (1.23-9.83) and 3.17 (1.58-6.35), p=0.03 and 0.001, respectively. Patients with mALBI 1+2a group had significantly longer survival than patients with mALBI 2b+3 group, i.e. not reach vs. 5 months (95%CI: 2.2-7.7), p<0.001, respectively (Fig 1). Interestingly, among uHCC patients with Child-Pugh class A, the mALBI 1+2a group had significantly longer survival than mALBI 2b+3 group, i.e. not reached vs. 6 months (95%CI: 4.0-7.9), p<0.001, respectively (Fig 2). Conclusion: Our uHCC cohort treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab had comparable outcome to those enrolled in the Phase III clinical trial.

This study aimed to describe 2 cohorts of patients similar to those enrolled in Phase 3 clinical studies of fibrosis due to NASH: REGENERATE which enrolled patients with pre-cirrhotic liver fibrosis due to NASH, and REVERSE which studied patients with cirrhosis due to NASH. Methods: Patients with NASH were identified from 2016 through 2019 within Optum’s electronic health record (EHR) Database by structured (diagnosis codes, procedure codes, laboratory results) and natural language processing data. Patients had either evidence of NASH or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with supporting evidence of steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, a positive liver imaging study, or a positive liver biopsy. The REGENERATE and REVERSE trial eligibility criteria were operationalized within the NASH EHR cohort at baseline (year prior to cohort entry) to identify ‘REGENERATE-like’ and ‘REVERSE-like’ patients. Cohort entry date was the earliest date in the study period when the patient was identified as having NASH. Incident comorbidities were identified in the time following cohort entry using diagnosis codes and laboratory values. Results: Among 93,204 patients identified as having possible NASH, 5,988 (6%) met the REGENERATE eligibility criteria and 3,542 (4%) met the REVERSE criteria. The average patient age was 57 years among ‘REGENERATE-like’ patients and 62 years among ‘REVERSE-like’ patients (Table 1). 62% of ‘REGENERATElike’ patients and 63% of ‘REVERSE-like’ patients were female, 81% and 86% were white, respectively. In the 12-month baseline period, ultrasound was recorded in 38% of ‘REGENERATE-like’ patients and 34% of ‘REVERSE-like’ patients, other imaging techniques in less than 10% of patients, and liver biopsy in 10% and 5% of patients, respectively. Incidence rates per 1,000 person-years for select comorbidities in follow-up are presented in Table 2 (the study evaluated more than 40 comorbidities). Compared to ‘REGENERATE-like’ patients, ‘REVERSE-like’ patients had a higher incidence of chronic kidney disease, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, liver transplant, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholelithiasis, and cholecystectomy. Conclusion: These results reveal a higher burden of comorbidities at baseline among patients with cirrhosis due to NASH. Ultrasound was the most common imaging modality recorded; liver biopsy was uncommon, reflecting low real-world utilization of biopsy-based staging of liver fibrosis. Further, the higher incidence of comorbidities in follow-up among patients with cirrhosis, compared to those with pre-cirrhotic advanced fibrosis, adds to the evolving body of literature on health risks associated with progression of liver fibrosis in individuals with NASH.",,,,L2025597738,10.1016/S0016-5085(23)04020-9

Seven (30.4%) patients had a complete response and 13 (56.5%) had a partial response; the ORR was 87.0% (95% CI, 66.4-97.2). Eleven (47.8%) patients showed disappearance of arterial enhancement in all target lesions (Figure 1B). Eight (33%) of 24 patients experienced treatment-related adverse events of any grade. The most common any-grade treatmentrelated adverse event was hyperkalemia (grade 2, 2 [8%] patients). One (4%) patient had a grade 3 treatment-related adverse event (neutropenia). None experienced any treatment-related serious adverse events. Conclusion: Combination treatment with Y90-radioembolization plus durvalumab demonstrated encouraging efficacy with favorable tolerability in patients with locally advanced unresectable HCC. Our phase 1/2a pilot study supports further evaluation of this treatment strategy in a randomized controlled trial.",,,,L641347146,10.1097/HEP.0000000000000347

The purpose of our study was to explore the clinical value of postoperative adjuvant anti-programed cell death 1 antibody (PA-PD-1) on the prognosis of HCC patients with high relapse risks after surgery. Patients and methods: Data of consecutive HCC patients with high recurrence risks treated with liver resection at our center during January 2019 and March 2021 were prospectively collected. Baseline differences were balanced between HCC patients with (PA-PD-1 group) or without PA-PD-1 (non-PD-1 group) after hepatectomy by propensity-score matching (PSM). Between these two groups, we compared overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Independent prognostic risk factors for OS and RFS were confirmed by Cox regression analysis, and subgroup analysis was also performed. Results: 47 pairs of patients with or without PD-1 treatment after hepatectomy were matched. After PSM, the 1-year and 2-year RFS was 58.4% and 44.1% in the PA-PD-1 group, and 34.0% and 21.3% in the non-PD-1 group (p = 0.008). The OS at 1 year and 2 years was 91.2% and 91.2% in the PA-PD-1 group, compared with 85.1% and 61.7% in the non-PD-1 group (p = 0.024). Multivariable analyses demonstrated that PA-PD-1 was an independent protective predictor associated with RFS and OS. Through subgroup analysis, we concluded that HCC patients with portal venous tumor thrombus (PVTT) or tumor size ≥ 5 cm significantly benefited from PA-PD-1 therapy in RFS and OS. Conclusions: Adjuvant anti-PD-1 antibody can effectively improve the survival outcomes of HCC patients with high relapse risks after hepatectomy in this prospective observational study.

The accumulation of tumour-modified myeloid cells derived from monocytes or neutrophils — termed ‘myeloid-derived suppressor cells’ — and tumour-associated macrophages is associated with poor outcome and resistance to treatments such as chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Unfortunately, there has been little success in large-scale clinical trials of myeloid cell modulators, and only a few distinct strategies have been used to target suppressive myeloid cells clinically so far. Preclinical and translational studies have now elucidated specific functions for different myeloid cell subpopulations within the tumour microenvironment, revealing context-specific roles of different myeloid cell populations in disease progression and influencing response to therapy. To improve the success of myeloid cell-targeted therapies, it will be important to target tumour types and patient subsets in which myeloid cells represent the dominant driver of therapy resistance, as well as to determine the most efficacious treatment regimens and combination partners. This Review discusses what we can learn from work with the first generation of myeloid modulators and highlights recent developments in modelling context-specific roles for different myeloid cell subtypes, which can ultimately inform how to drive more successful clinical trials.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01316822, NCT01413022, NCT01596751, NCT01790503, NCT02265536, NCT02435680, NCT02452424, NCT02499328, NCT02583477, NCT02637531, NCT02718911, NCT02732938, NCT02777710, NCT02807844, NCT02880371, NCT03101254, NCT03153410, NCT03161431, NCT03177187, NCT03335540, NCT03336216, NCT03400332, NCT03431948, NCT03496662, NCT03689699, NCT03697564, NCT03719326, NCT03742349, NCT03767582, NCT03768531, NCT03795610, NCT03927105, NCT03961698, NCT03980041, NCT04050462, NCT04123379, NCT04572451)",,36747021,L2021355544,10.1038/s41568-022-00546-2

Recent Findings: Despite an undeniable survival advantage of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with hematologic or solid malignancies, the accompanying off-target cardiovascular adverse events can be life-threatening. In patients with B cell malignancies, the use of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been associated with atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as hypertension. Cardiovascular toxic profiles are heterogeneous among the several approved breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-ABL TKIS. Notably, imatinib might be cardioprotective. Vascular endothelial growth factor TKIs, constituting the central axis in the treatment of several solid tumors, including renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, have strongly been associated with hypertension and arterial ischemic events. Epidermal growth factor TKIs as therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been reported to be infrequently associated with heart failure and QT prolongation. Summary: While tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been demonstrated to increase overall survival across different types of cancers, special consideration should be given to cardiovascular toxicities.

With the advancement in technology, various components of the viral cycle can now be measured in the blood to assess viral activity. In this review article, we summarize the relevant data of how antiviral therapies impact viral biomarkers, and discuss their potential implications. Viral nucleic acids including hepatitis B virus (HBV) double-stranded deoxy-ribonucleic acid (DNA) and to a lesser extent, pre-genomic RNA, are readily suppressed by nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs). The primary role of these markers include risk prediction for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and risk stratification for partial cure, defined as off-therapy virological control, or functional cure, defined as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance plus undetectable serum HBV DNA for ≥6 months. Viral translational products including hepatitis e antigen, quantitative HBsAg and hepatitis B core-related antigen can be reduced by NUCs and pegylated interferon a. They are important in defining disease phase, delineating treatment endpoints, and predicting clinical outcomes including HCC risk and partial/ functional cure. As the primary outcome of phase III trials in chronic hepatitis B is set as HBsAg seroclearance, appropriate viral biomarkers can potentially inform the efficacy of novel compounds. Early viral biomarker response can help with prioritization of subjects into clinical trials.

Recently, we discovered shared microenvironments between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and fetal tissues and described this phenomenon as an oncofetal ecosystem. This ecosystem includes fetal-like immune (macrophage) and stromal (endothelial) cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This discovery highlights reciprocal interactions between fetal-like macrophages and T cells which result in the orchestration of an immunosuppressive TME. Importantly, VEGF-A protein expression by tumor cells and fetal-like macrophages plays an important role in oncofetal reprogramming of the TME in HCCs. Interestingly, recent clinical data indicate that blocking VEGF-A or CTLA4 alongside PD-L1 is effective in treating advanced HCC. Consequently, some immunotherapies may target and rely on oncofetal cells for clinical responsiveness. This understanding provides exciting opportunities to utilize oncofetal niche characteristics as biomarkers of immunotherapy response in HCC and might also have validity for predicting responses to immunotherapy in other cancers.

Multi-kinase inhibitor (MKI) including sorafenib or lenvatinib is reserved for patients who are contraindicated for IO. The guideline recommendation is based on solid evidence from Phase 3 clinical trials, however, such recommendation might not be feasible in realworld since IO is not reimbursed in every country, and its affordability is an issue in real-world, especially in Asia.

Whether long-term suppression of replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) has any beneficial effect on regression of advanced liver fibrosis associated with chronic HBV infection had been unsolved issue. However, evolving evidences has shown that the long-term viral suppression improves liver fibrosis, which is closely associated with the liver-related complications in patients with CHB and even regresses cirrhosis. Evidences from the histological assessment have been suggested from the limited patients group of long-term follow-up data of the clinical trials, because the repeated liver biopsy is unsuitable in the real-world clinical setting: however, the results have been clear. Of 57 patients with adequate biopsy sample who received at least 3 years of cumulative entecavir therapy in phase 3 studies, 88% showed regression of ≥ 1 Ishak fibrosis score, including all 10 patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis at the study baseline. A 5-year open label follow-up study in patients with tenofovir disoproxyl fumarate (TDF) use (n = 348) also showed that 176 (51%) patients had regression of ≥ 1 Ishak score (P<0.001), and of 96 (28%) cirrhotic patients at baseline, 71 (74%) no longer had cirrhosis. Moreover, in the phase 3 trial comparing besifovir (BSV) with TDF, the proportion of subjects with Ishak score ≥ 3 decreased from 77.7% to 55.5% in BSV group and from 72.7% to 45.4% in the TDF group, respectively (all P<0.05), after 48 weeks of AVT. Therefore, sustained suppression of HBV DNA can even cause reversal of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis. Because performing repeated liver biopsy is impractical, non-invasive fibrosis measurements (NFMs) can be used to assess the improvement liver fibrosis. A more than 5-year long-term prospective cohort study for CHB patients (n = 120) with histological advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis showed that the liver stiffness (LS) value measured using transient elastography significantly and continuously decreased over time (mean LS value, 14.5 kPa to 8.3 kPa), and patients with low baseline LS values (<12.0 kPa) had a greater probability of significant LS improvement (<7.2 kPa at year 5) than those without (81.5% vs. 29.0%, P<0.001). Although changes in NFMs do not always correctly reflect histologic fibrosis evolution, baseline and on-therapy NFMs itself is known to be independent predictors of HCC development. Therefore, NFMs can be useful for clinicians to assess the evolution of liver fibrosis during the long-term AVT. However, patients with CHB cannot completely regress their baseline liver fibrosis in spite of the long-term AVT and even remain at risk for HCC, early detection of CHB activation and regular HCC surveillance should be continued even in the era of potent AVT.",,,,L641283578,10.1007/s12072-023-10501-4

Factors that can predict its survival outcomes have not been fully elucidated. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether the baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) could predict survival outcomes in patients with advanced HCC treated with combined TKI/anti-PD-1 antibodies. Methods: This retrospective study enrolled a total of 101 consecutive patients who received TKI plus anti-PD-1 antibody therapy as the first-line treatment for initially unresectable HCC at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University between August 2018 and September 2020. Tumor assessments were performed every 2 months (range 8-9 weeks) via contrast-enhanced MRI or CT by using RECIST v1.1. Baseline NLR<3.2 was assigned as ''low group'' and NLR relation coefficients3.2 as ''high group'' (59 and 42 patients respectively). Results: Cumulative overall survival at 1, 2 and 3 years was 63.4%, 50.6% and 33.6%, respectively. Cumulative overall survival differed significantly between patients with low group and high group (P = 0.0036) (Fig. 1). Conversely, cumulative progression-free survival did not differ between patients with low versus high NLR. The distribution of response was 2.0% for complete response, 30.7% for partial response, 46.5% for stable disease, and 14.9% for progressive disease.

Date of Publication: 1 Apr 2023","2023","83","7",,,"1 Apr 2023","Cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common primary liver cancer with extremely low survival rates. However, a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin is the only treatment for advanced unresectable cholangiocarcinoma currently, and the cancer can become resistant to the treatment, contributing to the high mortality. CPI-613 is a lipoic acid analog, which can inhibit dehydrogenases and disrupt mitochondrial metabolism. It is regarded as a promising anti-cancer drug and has been tested in multiple clinical trials. Efficacy and working mechanisms of CPI-613 have not been established in cholangiocarcinoma. In this study, we aim to evaluate the performance of CPI-613 in combination with other therapeutic drugs and unravel the metabolic underpinnings. We treated cholangiocarcinoma cell lines with different genetic backgrounds with standard of care chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) alone, CPI-613 alone, or the combination of the two. Results from viability assay showed that CPI-613 had synergistic (not simply additive) effects with standard of care chemotherapy. CPI-613 has a relatively short half-life, so longer infusion may be more beneficial even if the total dose remains the same. To mimic longer infusion, we treated the cells with multiple times of drug addition (fractional dosing), and compared the results to single addition. Oxygen consumption rate (an indicator of mitochondrial function) of cells under fractional dosing regimen was significantly lower in both short and long term, as measured by Agilent Seahorse and Resipher respectively. The results provided mechanistic support for longer infusion in clinical practice. We also collected plasma from patients before, during and after CPI-613 treatment in a clinical trial, and global metabolomics was performed. Global metabolomic changes induced by CPI-613 were identified and specific alternations in patients with complete response could be exploited as treatment targets or prediction markers. High frequency of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation is a characteristic of cholangiocarcinoma. Ivosidenib, an IDH1 inhibitor, has been shown to improve survival in chemotherapy-refractory cholangiocarcinoma patients in a phase 3 clinical trial. However, ivosidenib can increase alpha-ketoglutarate concentration, hence increasing the flux of TCA cycle and boosting mitochondrial fitness of the cancer cells. We hypothesized that the combination of CPI-613 and Ivosidenib could negate this effect and have better anti-cancer activities. Indeed, results from viability assay demonstrated synergy between CPI-613 and Ivosidenib. Metabolic flux analysis and global metabolomics were performed to illustrate the metabolic mechanisms of the combination of CPI-613 and Ivosidenib. Our study provides the mechanistic support for the use of CPI-613 in combination with other therapeutic agents and the results should be translated to clinical studies.",,,,L641468003,10.1158/1538-7445.AM2023-2236

This meta-analysis aimed to explore the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) vs chemotherapy in patients with lung cancer with liver metastases (LM) or brain metastases (BM). Design Meta-analysis and systematic review. Data sources We systematically searched in electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science), up to 31 January 2022. We also reviewed the abstracts from major international conferences. Eligibility criteria were randomised controlled phase II or III trials reporting the overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) of LM or BM subsets. Data extraction and synthesis Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for OS and PFS were extracted and aggregated using a random-effects model. Results Twenty-four randomised controlled trials with available outcomes for patients with BMs or LMs were identified. A total of 1124 patients with BM and 2077 patients with LM were included in the analysis. The pooled OS HR of patients with LMs was 0.83 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), and that of patients without LM 0.73 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.79). LM was associated with less benefits from ICIs. In patients with BM treated with ICIs, the pooled OS HR compared with the control arms was 0.71 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.94). Subgroup analyses by histology suggested that only patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with BM could gain benefit from ICIs (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.68). BM negatively influenced efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with small cell lung cancer. Conclusions Our results showed immunotherapy demonstrated efficacy in patients with lung cancer with LM and BM, survival benefits dominantly favoured patients with NSCLC. Patients with lung cancer with LM obtained less benefits from ICIs than those without. Therefore, organ-specific immunotherapeutic approaches should be considered.

Recently, patient care was revolutionized by the introduction of immunotherapy combining anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint inhibition with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy as first-line treatment for advanced unresectable HCC. Additional promising studies with mono- or combination immunotherapy are in advanced phases of clinical testing. Currently, however, our understanding of which patients profit from immunotherapy and how therapy response may be related to the composition of the tumour immune microenvironment remains incomplete. Inhibitory receptors as targets of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies are strongly expressed by T cells in the tumour microenvironment (TME). However, the HCC microenvironment is highly heterogeneous as illustrated by distinct molecular subtypes and subclassifications with an immune-rich microenvironment representing only a small proportion of HCCs. A better understanding of the tumour immune microenvironment is expected to provide insights for clinically applicable biomarkers to optimize immunotherapies. Recent studies identified subtypes of PD-1 expressing CD8+ T cells with divergent function in the HCC TME associated with different outcomes, suggesting that specific PD-1 expressing CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM), but not exhausted CD8+ T cells (TEX), govern positive therapy outcomes.

Aim: We report an exploratory analysis of EuroQol 5D visual analog scale (EQ-5D VAS) scores in patients with CHD after 48 weeks of treatment with bulevirtide (BLV) in an ongoing Phase 3 trial. Methods and Results: MYR301 (NCT03852719) is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter trial that assigned 150 patients with CHD (1:1:1) to BLV 2 mg (n=49), BLV 10 mg (n=50), or control (n=51) for up to 3 years. Control patients received no BLV treatment until week 48 (W48). The EQ-5D VAS is a self-completed rating of patients’ quality of life (QOL) with a range of 0–100 (100=best health state). The QOL analysis was based on EQ-5D VAS scores at baseline and W48. Baseline characteristics were well balanced across groups. At W48, patients with CHD treated with BLV 2 mg reported statistically significant improvement in QOL (by EQ-5D VAS) and significantly better EQ-5D VAS change from baseline scores when compared with control patients (Table).

However, direct comparison with other combination treatments including immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) plus tyrosinekinase inhibitors (TKIs) or anti-CTLA4 are lacking. The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) is to indirectly compare the efficacy and the safety of first-line systemic treatments. Materials and methods: Literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases was conducted up to October, 2022. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing TKIs, including Sorafenib and Lenvatinib, or ICIs reporting overall survival (OS) and progression- free survival (PFS) were included. Individual survival data were extracted from OS and PFS curves to calculate restricted mean survival time (RMST). A Bayesian NMA was performed to compare treatments in terms of efficacy (15- and 30-month OS, 6-month PFS) and safety, represented by grade≥3 (severe) adverse events (SAEs). [Figure presented] [Table presented] The incremental safety-effectiveness ratio (ISER) as measure of net health benefit was calculated as the difference in probability of SAEs divided by difference in survival between the 2 most effective treatments. Results: Nine RCTs enrolling 6600 patients were included. Atezolizumab+bevacizumab showed the highest probability (88%) of being the best in 30-month OS. Pembrolizumab+lenvatinib showed the highest probability (94%) of being the best in terms of PFS. ICI monotherapies were the most safe combination. At a willingness-to-risk threshold of 10% of SAEs for month-year gained, atezolizumab+bevacizumab was favored in 76% of cases, while at a threshold of 30% of SAEs for month-year gained, pembrolizumab+lenvatinib was favored in 72% of cases. Conclusions: Atezolizumab plus Bevacizumab is the preferred option in unfit patients with high tumor burden, while Pembrolizumab plus Lenvatinib could be preferred for fit patients with less advanced vascular tumor spread.",,,,L2022883276,10.1016/S1590-8658(23)00285-2

METHODS: Previous PopPK models for T and D were updated using data from previous studies in various cancers and combined with Study 22 and HIMALAYA. Typical population mean parameters and associated inter-and intra-individual variability, as well as the influence of covariates on the PopPK parameters of T and D, were assessed. Individual exposure metrics were derived from the individual empirical Bayes estimates as drivers for ER analysis for efficacy and safety. RESULTS: The observed PK of T in uHCC was well described by a 2-compartment model with both linear and time-dependent elimination. All identified covariates changed PK parameters of T or D by less than 20%, thus are regarded to be of minimal clinical relevance. No T or D exposure metric was significantly associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), or adverse events in STRIDE, due to plateau of the ER curve at this selected dose level. Baseline aspartate aminotransferase and neutrophil-to- lymphocyte ratio were associated with OS (P < 0.001) by Cox proportional hazards model. No covariate was identified as a significant factor for the PFS hazard. CONCLUSION: No dose adjustment for T or D is needed based on PopPK covariate or ER analyses.

This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, exposure–response, and exposure–pharmacodynamics relationships of tremelimumab in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). Patients and Methods: A previous tremelimumab population pharmacokinetic model was validated using data from parts 2 and 3 of Study 22. Exposure–response analyses explored relationships of tremelimumab exposure with efficacy and safety. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics relationships were evaluated using linear and nonlinear regression models. Results: The observed pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab in uHCC were consistent with predictions; no significant covariates were identified. Tremelimumab exposure was not significantly associated with adverse events, objective response rate, or progression-free survival. Overall survival (OS) was longer for patients with tremelimumab exposure, minimum serum drug concentration (C(min1)) ≥ median versus C(min1) < median (18.99 months vs. 10.97 months), but this exposure-survival analysis might be confounded with baseline characteristics of albumin level and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, which had a significant impact on OS (P ¼ 0.0004 and 0.0001, respectively).

We assessed the association between their outcome, and the level and characteristics of pre-existing evidence. METHODS: EMBASE, PubMed, and proceedings from international meetings were searched for phase III gastrointestinal cancer trials (gastro-oesophageal [GEC], hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], biliary tract [BTC], pancreatic [PC], small bowel [SBC], colorectal [CRC], anal [AC], stromal [GIST], and neuroendocrine [NET]) between 01/2000 and 06/2020.

The main characteristic of NAFLD is considered that the excessive fat is accumulated and deposited in hepatocytes without excess alcohol intake or some other pathological causes. NAFLD is a progressive disease, ranging from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, and death. Therefore, NAFLD will probably emerge as the leading cause of end-stage liver disease in the coming decades. Unlike other highly prevalent diseases, NAFLD has received little attention from the global public health community. Liver biopsy is currently considered the gold standard for the diagnosis and staging of NAFLD because of the absence of noninvasive and specific biomarkers. Due to the complex pathophysiological mechanisms of NAFLD and the heterogeneity of the disease phenotype, no specific pharmacological therapies have been approved for NAFLD at present, although several drugs are in advanced stages of development.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive form of the disease that can lead to severe complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite its high prevalence, no drugs are currently approved for the treatment of NASH. The drug development pipeline in NASH is very active, yet most assets do not progress to phase III trials and those that do reach phase III often fail to achieve the endpoints necessary for approval by regulatory agencies. Amongst other reasons, the methodological and operational features of traditional clinical trials in NASH might impede optimal drug development. In this regard, platform trials might be an attractive complement or alternative to conventional clinical trials. Platform trials use a master protocol which enables evaluation of multiple investigational medicinal products concurrently or sequentially with a single, shared control arm. Through Bayesian interim analyses, these trials allow for early exit of drugs from the trial based on success or futility, while providing participants better chances of receiving active compounds through adaptive randomisation. Overall, platform trials represent an alternative for patients, pharmaceutical companies, and clinicians in the quest to accelerate the approval of pharmacologic treatments for NASH.",,,36216134,L2021591692,10.1016/j.jhep.2022.09.021

The registered trials did not identify a treatment that prolonged recurrence-free survival, the primary outcome of the majority of research. Several investigator-initiated trials have demonstrated that various treatments extend patients’ recurrence-free or overall survival after curative therapies. In the past decade, targeted therapy has made significant strides in the treatment of advanced HCC. These targeted medicines produce antitumour effects via specific signals, such as anti-angiogenesis or advancement of the cell cycle. As a typical systemic treatment option, it significantly improves the prognosis of this fatal disease.

CLERANCE was designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of CABO in pts with HCC in real-world practice in a French population. Methods: This prospective, French multicentre (n=17), interventional study aims to recruit 110 pts with unresectable HCC when a decision of CABO treatment was made in 2L or 3L after prior sorafenib (SOR) failure, according to the French health authority approved label. The primary endpoint is the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) of grade > 2 (NCI-CTCAE v5) by a central review committee. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) (RECIST v1.1 per investigator assessed), progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) and profiles of CABO administration. Results: Of 110 pts enrolled, the final analysis focused on the 99 pts who starting CABO (11 pts withdrawn due to screen failure) and followed up to 12 mo (data cut-off: November 8, 2021). Pts were mainly males (89%), 69 years median age (range 24-85), Child-Pugh A (94.9%) / B7 (5.1%), and ALBI score-1 (33%), 2 (60%), 3 (5%), not evaluated (NE) (2%). About 59% pts received CABO in 2L after SOR, whereas 41% were in 3L after SOR and another line (TKI or IO). SOR was discontinued due to tumor progression (68%) or intolerance (32%) with a median duration of 4.2 mo (95% CI 3.5-4.8) and a median dose of 800 mg (95% CI 631-800). In the 99 pts starting CABO, 128 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) of grade > 2 were reported, 40 of them classified as TRAE: hand foot skin reaction (14%), diarrhea (11%), asthenia and/or anorexia and/or weight loss (12%), arterial hypertension (4%). The ORR was 7% with 58% of disease control rate (DCR). Median PFS was 6.2 mo (95% CI, 5.3-8.7), TTP 8.2 mo (95% CI 6.1-12.8), without any difference when CABO used in 2L or 3L line (with prior IO [11%] or not). OS was 11.5 mo (95% CI 9.2- 14.6) since start of CABO and 23 mo (95% CI 17.3-29.4) since the first systemic line. ALBI score at 1 was an independent marker of better OS in multivariate analysis (Exp[b] 3.26, 95% CI 1.86-5.69, p<0.0001). The median duration of CABO was 5.2 mo (95% CI 3.5-6.0), the median daily dose 40 mg (95% CI 32.3-43.6), 66% of pts needed dose reduction, and permanent CABO discontinuation in 75.8% pts, due to: i) death (7%), tumor progression (54%) (median time to progression 5.3 mo; 95% CI 3.7-12.8), or AE (15.2%) (median time to AE 2.6 mo; 95% CI 1.5-7.7).

Results: Sixty-six pts were randomized, 43 with LM (12 colorectal, 5 breast, 4 pancreas, 3 lung, 19 other), 23 with HCC. 59% had ECOG performance status 2 or 3, 64% Child Pugh (CP) score A vs. 36% CP B or C. The clinical target volume irradiated was the whole liver or near whole liver (median 2013 cc). Forty-two pts (24 on RT and 18 on BSC) completed baseline and 1-month assessments. The average baseline pain at worst score was 7/ 10. A significant improvement in the primary endpoint, 'worst' pain score on BPI, from baseline to 1 month was seen in 67% of pts on RT and 22% on BSC (p = 0.004). The proportion of pts with improved 'worst' pain at 1 month, with no increase in opioid use was 21% on RT vs 0% with BSC (p = 0.07). From baseline to 1 month, the proportion of pts with a significant improvement in BPI “pain at its least” was higher for pts on RT vs. BSC (63% vs. 28%, p = 0.03), as was BPI “percentage relief in pain by treatment” (59% vs. 25%, p = 0.04). A sensitivity analysis of all pts, treating those with no 1 month assessment as having 'no improvement', found improvements in BPI 'worst' pain in 49% of pts on RT and 12% for BSC alone (p = 0.002). Eleven patients on the BSC arm crossed over to receive RT at 1 month. A trend to improvement in FACT HBS post RT vs BSC was seen at 1 month (p = 0.07), with no statistically significant difference in other FACT-Hep subscales. The proportion of pts with grade≥2AE (CTCAEv4.0) at day 30 was 58% on RT vs 33% on BSC (p = 0.05). Grade ≥3 AE were uncommon. There was a trend for improved 3 month survival with RT (51% vs. 33% for BSC alone, p = 0.07). Conclusions: Single fraction RT (8 Gy) improves hepatic pain in the majority of patients with end-stage HCC or liver metastases, with a trend to improved survival.",,,,L640367652,10.1200/jco.2023.41.4_suppl.lba492

Here we report the AESIs for sintilimab and IBI305 in Orient- 32. Methods: 571 eligible pts with unresectable HCC were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either sintilimab plus IBI305 or Sor (400 mg orally twice daily), until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The co-primary endpoints were OS and independent radiological review committee (IRRC)- assessed PFS according to RECIST 1.1. AESIs were defined by the sponsor and reported without judgement of causality. Analyses explored the incidence and severity of AESIs as well as correlation between AESIs and efficacy. Results: The safety set included 402 pts in the sintilimab plus IBI305 group and 184 pts in the Sor group. At the data cutoff on Dec 30th, 2021, the median follow-up time was 26.7 months. Any AESIs (≥1%) for sintilimab plus IBI305 group and Sor group occurred in 77.9% pts and 53.3% pts, respectively. The incidence of treatment-related grade 3-4 AESI for sintilimab+ IBI305 was 31.3% and treatment-related serious AESI was 13.9%. The most common any AESIs were proteinuria (61.7% ), hypertension (41.8%), hemorrhage (15.4%) and hyperthyroidism (14.2%) (Table). In the characteristics of baseline, ages can be a predictor of the onset of proteinuria, hypertension and hyperthyroidism. In addition, the occurrence of of proteinuria and hypertension can be a predictor for a better survival. Conclusions: AESIs for sintilimab and IBI305 were tolerable and manageable in Orient-32 trial.

According to Phase 1b study data (Lee Lancet Oncol 2020), when combined with atezo, bev has a clinically relevant contribution in terms of immune enhancement and normalization of tumor blood vessels. However, it is unknown if bev being skipped due to bev adverse events of special interest (AESIs) has an impact on the efficacy of atezo + bev. Here, we conducted an exploratory efficacy analysis examining patients who had skipped bev vs those who never skipped bev using IMbrave150 study data. Methods: In Arm A of IMbrave150, patients were assigned to receive atezo + bev. Group A-1 included patients whose bev was ever skipped due to bev AESIs. Group A-2 included the patients who were not included in group A-1. Landmark analyses of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were performed in patients who received atezo + bev for≥6 months to minimize immortal time bias. Results: Of 210 patients who received≥6 months of atezo + bev, 69 were assigned to group A-1 and 141 were assigned to group A-2. No obvious differences between groups were observed in the distribution of baseline characteristics. Of the group A-1 patients, 75.4% were BCLC stage C and 76.8%were Child-Pugh A5, while group A-2 patients were 80.1% BCLC stage C and 77.0% were Child-Pugh A5.

First-line treatment options for patients with advanced disease previously included tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with vascular endothelial growth factor. Recently, the phase III HIMALAYA trial investigated the STRIDE regimen, tremelimumab 300mg 3 1 dose and durvalumab 1500mg every 4 weeks, compared to sorafenib in previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic HCC patients, and resulted in significantly improved overall survival (OS) (16.4 mos vs 13.8mos, HR=0.78) and a well-tolerated safety profile (≥grade 3 treatment-related adverse events 25.8% vs 36.9% ). Notably, the HIMALAYA trial did not enroll subject from mainland China and excluded patients with class Child-Pugh B liver dysfunction or ECOG performance status (PS) 2. We hypothesize the STRIDE regimen will be safe and well tolerated in Chinese patients with locally advanced or metastatic HCC with Child-Pugh class A or B liver dysfunction or ECOG PS 0-2. In addition, the study will also assess efficacy and explore biomarkers. Methods: This will be an open label, multicenter phase IIIb study investigating the safety and efficacy of the STRIDE regimen in Chinese unresectable HCC patients without prior systemic therapy. Patients with Child-Pugh A liver dysfunction and ECOG PS 0-1 will be enrolled in cohort 1, while patients with Child-Pugh B liver dysfunction or ECOG PS 2 will be enrolled in cohort 2. Patients with main portal vein tumor thrombosis (Vp4), clinically significant ascites or hepatic encephalopathy, or active or prior documented gastrointestinal bleeding within 12 months will be excluded. We plan to enroll 300 patients with the primary endpoint of grade 3- 5 adverse event (AE) rate by CTCAE v5.0 and adverse events of special interest (AESI). Secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS), OS, OS rate at 6 months and 12 months.

Date of Publication: 1 Feb 2023","2023","41","4","TPS631",,"1 Feb 2023","Background: HCC is increasing rapidly in incidence worldwide driven by a rise in chronic liver disease including non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH). Most pts are not suitable for curative or loco-regional treatments and may be candidates for systemic therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with VEGF inhibition is a standard of care in HCC. However, a meta-analysis of 3 phase III randomised trials of PD-1 or PDL-1 inhibitors (n > 1,600 pts) with HCC suggests that pts with NASH-related HCC treated with PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitors had reduced overall survival compared with other aetiologies. Neutrophils expressing the chemokine receptor CXCR2, crucial to neutrophil recruitment in acuteinjury, are highly represented in NASH-HCC. In NASH-HCC murine models, lacking response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors, AZD5069 (CXCR2 inhibitor) in combination with anti-PDL-1 suppressed tumor burden and extended survival, accompanied by an increase in tumor-associated neutrophils which switched from a pro-tumor to anti-tumor progenitor-like neutrophil phenotype. We propose that inhibition of CXCR2 may potentiate the efficacy of anti-PDL-1 inhibition in pts with HCC. Methods: In this multi-centre (n = 10) study, pts with biopsy-confirmed HCC, PS ECOG,1, Child- Pugh A, , 1 prior systemic therapies, receive 1 of escalating doses of AZD5069 (bid, po daily) with Durvalumab (1.5 gm iv on day 1) in 28-day cycles for up to 2 years to determine the recommended phase II dose using a Keyboard design, followed by an additional cohort of pts to determine the antitumor efficacy of this combination using a Simon's two-stage design (min 18, max 35 pts; target objective response rate.30%; unacceptable response rate,10%).

However, the optimal sequence of therapy after failure of Ate/Bev is unknown. Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks the activity of protein kinases involved in angiogenesis, oncogenesis, metastasis, and tumour immunity. Although regorafenib showed survival benefit as subsequent treatment in patients with advanced HCC after progression on sorafenib, the efficacy and safety of regorafenib as subsequent therapy after Ate/Bev has not been investigated yet. Therefore, we designed a phase II trial investigating the efficacy and safety of regorafenib as second-line therapy in patients with advanced HCC who progressed on first-line Ate/Bev. Methods: This is a phase II, multicenter, single-arm study in patients with advanced HCC who had progression on first-line Ate/Bev. Additional key eligibility criteria include with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, Child-Pugh score of 5 or 6, evaluable disease per RECIST v1.1, prior administration of at least 2 cycles of Ate/Bev, and adequate organ function.

Pts were randomized 1:1 to S 400 mg BID vs. SBRT (27.5-50 Gy in 5 fractions) followed by S 200 mg BID, increased to 400 mg BID after 28 days. Primary endpoint was OS; reported secondary endpoints - PFS, adverse events (AEs - CTCAEv4), and QOL (improvement in FACT-Hep score by ≥ 5 points from baseline to 6 months). Planned sample size was 292 pts (238 OS events, HR=0.72, 80% power, 1-sided a=0.05). Accrual closed early, due to a change in HCC standard of care.

Emerging evidence suggest a detrimental role of early antibiotics (ATB) exposure in immunotherapy recipients. However, it is unclear whether ATB affect outcomes of pts receiving A+B. Methods: We conducted a patient-level analysis of subjects receiving either A+B or Sorafenib (Sor) within the IMbrave150 trial to assess the impact of early ATB exposure (ATB+, i.e. +/-30 from treatment initiation) on overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Differences in median (m) OS and mPFS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional regression models were used to assess the prognostic impact of ATB+ adjusting for race, age, baseline AFP, baseline ALBI grade, continent of origin and neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio, a measure of systemic inflammation. Results: Data of 420 IMbrave150 participants were made available by Vivli. Among them, 278 received A+B and 142 Sor. Most pts were of ECOG performance status 0 (65%); 47% had extrahepatic spread, 40% had macrovascular invasion and35% had AFP.400 ng/mL. Viral aetiology (39% HBV and 24% HCV) was the most common risk factor for HCC. Overall, 60 pts in the A+B arm (21.5%) and 31 (21.8%) in the Sor group were ATB+. Baseline characteristics were well balanced across ATB groups, except for region of origin, with a higher proportion of Asian pts in ATB+ (60% vs 45%; p=0.01). After a median follow-up of 10.38 months (95%CI:8.6-12.5), OS and PFS rates at 12 months were 72.3% and 9.7% in A+B; 64.8%, and 1.4% in Sor, respectively. ATB+ exposure was associated with increased risk of death both in univariate (HR 1.67; 95%CI 1.04-2.69) and multivariate models (HR 1.62; 95%CI 1.40-1.89) in the A+B (p for interaction <0.001), but not in the Sor arm (univariate HR 0.63; 95%CI 0.32-1.25; multivariate HR 0.70; 95%CI 0.31-1.60). Similarly, the risk of progression was increased for ATB+ pts in the A+B arm (univariate HR 1.68; 95%CI 1.03-2.71; multivariate HR 1.59; 95%CI 1.40-1.81), but not in the Sor arm (univariate HR 0.51;95%CI 0.26-1.01; multivariate HR 0.53; 95%CI 0.21-1.30) with positive p for interaction (p=0.002). Objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST v.1.1 did not differ between ATB+ (28.0%) and ATB- (30.0%) in A+B (p=0.68). Conclusions: In a post-hoc sub-analysis of IMbrave150 we demonstrate for the first time the negative impact of early antibiotics exposure on outcomes of patients receiving A+B but not in those treated with Sor. Prospective translational studies should evaluate the role of ATB-mediated gut dysbiosis as a proposed mechanism underlying the adverse outcome in immunotherapy-recipients.",,,,L640367888,10.1200/jco.2023.41.4_suppl.597

We performed a network metaanalysis of phase III of trials to compare first line systemic treatments for aHCC in terms of overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and incidence of grade.3 adverse events (AEs). Methods: After performing a literature review from January 2008 to September 2022, we identified 6329 studies for screening, 3009 for revision, leading to identification of 15 phase III trials for the analysis: SHARP, Asia Pacific, Cheng 2013, Johnson 2013, Cainap 2015, REFLECT, CheckMate459, IMbrave150, ORIENT-32, HIMALAYA, COSMIC-312 and Qin 2021, Qin 2022, LEAP-002 and RATIONALE-301. These tested respectively: sorafenib (S) vs placebo (SHARP and Asia Pacific), sunitinib (Sun) vs S, brivanib (Bri) vs S, linifanib (Lin) vs S, lenvatinib (L) vs S, nivolumab (Nivo) vs S, atezolizumab+bevacizumab (A+B) vs S, sintilimab+IBI-305 vs S, durvalumab+tremelimumab (D+T) vs S, atezolizumab+ cabozantinib (A+C) vs S, donafenib vs S, camrelizumab plus rivoceranib (C+R) vs S, pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib (P+L) vs L, and tislelizumab (TS) vs S as first line treatments for aHCC. Relative risks (RR) for grade > 3 adverse events (AEs), and hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for overall (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were extracted for each study. A frequentist network meta-analysis, with fixed effect multivariable meta-regression models to estimate the indirect pooled HRs, RRs and corresponding 95%CI, was performed considering S as reference. Results: In total, 10820 patients were included in the analysis, among them, 10444 received active treatment and 376 placebo. Sintilimab plus IBI-350 and A+B provided the greatest reduction in the risk of death compared to S, with a HR of 0.57 (95%CI:0.43-0.75), and 0.58 (95%CI:0.42-0.82), respectively; followed by C+R (HR:0.62; 95%CI:0.49-0-79), P+L (HR:0.77; 95%CI:0.62-0.97) and D+T (HR:0.78; 95%CI:0.66-0.93). Considering PFS, C+R and P+L were associated with the greatest reduction in the risk of PFS events compared to S, with HR of 0.52 (95%CI: 0.41-0.65; 0.35-0.77, respectively). When looking at the risk of AEs, the combination of A+C (RR: 1.55;95%CI:0.80-3.02), C+R (RR:1.54;95%CI:0.95-2.50) and P+L (RR:1.23;95%CI:0.72-2.11) were associated with the highest risk of grade .3 AEs; whereas immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) monotherapy (Nivo and TS) had the lowest risk (RR:0.46; 95%CI:0.20-1.05 and RR: 0.74; 95%CI: 0.45-1.21).

Methods: This was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, control clinical trial. Eligible HCC patients with PVTT were included and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive SOR-TACE or sorafenib alone as postoperative adjuvant therapy. Sorafenib treatment was started within 3 days after randomization, with an initial dose of 400mg twice a day. In the SOR-TACE group, TACE was performed one day after the administration of sorafenib. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS). Results: From October 2019 to March 2022, a total of 158 HCC patients with PVTT from China were enrolled and randomized. After a median follow-up duration of 28.4 months, the median RFS was significantly longer in the SOR-TACE group (16.8 vs. 12.6 months; hazard ratio, 0.57; P = 0.002). The median overall survival (OS) was also significantly longer with SORTACE than with sorafenib (30.4 vs. 22.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.57; P = 0.017). Multivariable analysis indicated SOR-TACE treatment was an independent risk factor for both RFS and OS. The SOR-TACE group did not show additional toxicity compared with the sorafenib alone group.

Reported rates of treatment-emergent ADAs (TE-ADAs) vary from 1.5% for pembrolizumab and 8.6% for nivolumab to 54.1% for atezolizumab across indications (Enrico et al. Clin Cancer Res 2020). In the global, Phase 3 HIMALAYA study (NCT03298451) in uHCC, the STRIDE regimen (Single T Regular Interval D) significantly improved overall survival vs sorafenib (S); D monotherapy was noninferior to S (Abou-Alfa et al. NEJM Evid 2022). Here, we analyzed ADAs to T and D in HIMALAYA. Methods: Prespecified secondary analyses assessed the presence of ADAs to D and T before the first study dose (baseline), once during treatment and once after treatment discontinuation. For participants (pts) who were ADA-positive at any visit (ADA+), presence of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) was also assessed. TE-ADA+ was defined as pts with a positive post-baseline sample only or pts with an ADA titer that increased≥4-fold following treatment. ADA negative (ADA-) was defined as pts with no positive sample at any visit, at baseline or post-baseline. Objective response rate (ORR; RECIST v1.1, inc. unconfirmed), overall survival (OS) and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were evaluated in ADA subgroups. Results: The frequency of ADAs to D was similar in the STRIDE (T+D) and D arms: 8.2% (24/294) and 7.1% (20/282) of pts, respectively, were ADA+ to D; 3.1% (9/294) and 2.8% (8/282) of pts, respectively, were TE-ADA+ to D; and 1.7% (5/294) and 0.7% (2/282) of pts, respectively, had nAbs to D. In the STRIDE arm, 15.9% (29/182) of pts were ADA+ to T, 11.0% (20/182) of pts were TEADA+ to T, and 4.4% (8/182) of pts had nAbs to T. Although the number of pts was small, in the STRIDE arm, ORR was 11.1% (1/9) in pts TE-ADA+ to D, 35.0% (7/20) in pts TE-ADA+ to T and 23.9% (94/ 393) in the full analysis set (FAS). In the D arm, ORR was 25.0% (2/8) in pts TE-ADA+ to D and 18.5% (72/389) in the FAS. OS for pts TE-ADA+/nAb+ to D or T in the D and STRIDE arms was consistent with the FAS. In both arms, TRAE and Grade 3/4 TRAE rates were not increased in the ADA+ vs ADA- groups (Table) and were generally consistent with the overall population. Conclusions: In HIMALAYA, the rates of TE-ADAs and nAbs to D and T were low (≤11%). The presence of ADAs did not appear to impact clinical efficacy or safety of STRIDE or D monotherapy in the small number of ADA+ pts.

This analysis examined the HRQoL outcomes in pts in both arms. Methods: Systemic therapy-naïve adults with histologically confirmed uHCC were randomized 1:1 to receive TIS (200 mg IV Q3W, n=342) or SOR (400 mg PO BID, n=332). HRQoL was assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-HCC18 and EQ5D-5L. A mixed model for repeated measures using key prespecified PRO endpoints of global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL), physical functioning and fatigue scales of the QLQ-C30, and HCC18 index score, fatigue and pain scores at the key pre-specified clinical cycles 4 and 6 were performed. Time to deterioration was examined with the Kaplan-Meier method using the PRO endpoints. Results: At both cycles, TIS had better HRQoL outcomes than SOR, as indicated by LS mean differences in GHS/QoL, physical functioning, fatigue and HCC symptom index, but not for pain. TIS had a lower risk for deterioration of QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68 [95% CI, 0.49-0.94]), physical functioning (0.53 [0.39-0.73]) and fatigue (0.48 [0.37, 0.63]) as well as for deterioration in the HCC18 index (0.53 [0.34-0.81]) and fatigue (0.60 [0.46-0.80]).

Hispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) are the largest racial/ ethnic groups in the United States after non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Hispanics accounted for 19%, while NHB accounted for 14% of the population in 2021. From 2012 to 2019 the proportion of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and biliary tract cancers (BTC) occurring in Hispanics was 23.2% and 22.6% respectively; the proportion of HCC and BTC occurring in NHB was 11.1% and 8.3% respectively. We examined the participation of NHB and Hispanics in multinational phase III clinical trials of HCC and BTC in the last ten years. A participant to population ratio (PPR) of 0.8-1.2 reflects adequate ethnic/racial representation; a lower PPR indicates underrepresentation. Methods: A database search was performed in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science: Core Collection (Cl for multinational phase III clinical trials of HCC or BTC, studying first and second line treatments published from August 2012 to August 2022.Trials meeting these criteria were identified and the percentage of NHB and Hispanics included was calculated and compared to the proportion of NHB and Hispanics affected by HCC and BTC as per the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Results: Eighteen multinational phase III clinical trials studying first- and second-line treatments for HCC and BTC were identified. The trials enrolled a total of 12464 patients; 27% (n=5 trials) did not report racial/ethnic characteristics. Of the 9991 patients included in trials for which race/ ethnicity was provided, 11 (0.08%) were Hispanics and 88 (0.7%) were NHB. The participant to population ratio (PPR) in Hispanics for HCC was 0.003 and 0 for BTC, meanwhile the PPR in NHB was 0.6 for HCC and 0 for BTC. Conclusions: NHB and Hispanics are underrepresented in HCC and BTC in multinational phase III trials relative to the U.S population.

We present here the results of prespecified exploratory patient (pt)-reported outcomes (PROs). Methods: 794 pts were randomized. PROs were assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30, EuroQol-5D5L (EQ5D-5L), and EORTC QLQ-HCC18 questionnaires. Analysis population for HRQoL endpoints included pts who received ≥1 dose of study Tx and completed ≥1 HRQoL assessment. Least squares mean (LSM) score changes from baseline (BL) to wk 27 were compared using a constrained longitudinal data analysis model (covariates: Tx, time, Tx by time interaction, and stratification factors). Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate time to deterioration (TTD, time to 1st onset of ≥10 [out of 100] deterioration from BL in a given scale or subscale/confirmed by a 2nd adjacent ≥10 deterioration from BL) for EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status (GHS)/QoL, physical functioning (PF), and EORTC QLQ-HCC18 abdominal swelling, pain and fatigue, as reported by pts. Stratified Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the magnitude of the Tx difference (HR) between arms in TTD. Results: Compliance with PRO assessments was >91% from BL until wk 27 in both arms. From BL to wk 27, LSM changes in GHS/QoL, PF, role functioning (RF), QLQ-HCC18 functional/domain scores and EQ5D-5L VAS were generally similar between the two arms (Table). Treatment with len + pembro delayed deterioration of patient-reported quality of life vs len + pbo (median TTD, 11.5 vs 4.3 mo; HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65-0.98).

However, in the global phase 3 study comparing the effectiveness of lenvatinib and sorafenib, only a limited population of patients were enrolled, excluding those who had a high-burden intrahepatic lesion or Child-Pugh class (C-P) B, who were likely to receive systemic therapy in the clinical practice. Currently, combination immunotherapy has replaced multikinase inhibitors as the standard first-line treatment. Therefore, this prospective study explored the safety and efficacy of lenvatinib in the patient population, which would be used in real-world practice. Methods: This was an open-label, multicenter, prospective study that enrolled patients who had advanced HCC with C-P A or B, treated with lenvatinib as first-line or second-line after atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Atz + Bv) at 10 sites in Japan. The study included patients who had high tumor burden, defined as identifying either tumor volume of more than 50% of the liver, portal vein tumor thrombosis reaching the main trunk or the contralateral branch, or bile duct invasion at baseline (jRCTs031190017). Results: Between December 1, 2019, and September 30, 2021, 59 patients were recruited for this study. At the time of enrollment, 47 and 12 patients were classified as C-P A and B, respectively. This study included 11 patients with high tumor burden and 12 treated with second-line after Atz + Bv. All patients with high tumor burden and second-line treatment were classified as C-P A. Median overall survival of C-P A and B patients was 20.3 and 4.2 months, respectively. Similarly, progression-free survival according to modified RECIST (mRECIST) of C-P A and B patients was 4.8 and 2.8 months, respectively. Objective response rate (ORR) according to mRECIST in C-P A patients was 61.9%, whereas in C-P B patients was 25.0%. ORRs of high-burden group and second-line group were 80.0% and 40.0%, respectively. Major severe adverse events (AE) (≥grade 3) in C-P A patients were hypertension (41.3%) and proteinuria (23.9%). In contrast, those in C-P B patients were hyponatremia (41.7%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (41.7%), hypertension (33.3%), decreased appetite (16.7%), diarrhea (16.7%), and proteinuria (16.7%). Discontinuation rate due to AE of C-P A and B patients was 17.4% and 33.3%, respectively. In high-burden and secondline groups, 10% and 20% discontinued lenvatinib due to AE, respectively. Conclusions: Lenvatinib is expected to be safe and effective in patients with advanced HCC who have a high tumor burden and second-line treatment after Atz + Bv, whereas liver function was maintained with C-P A.

We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of immunotherapy or targeted therapy as the first-line strategy for unresectable HCC. Methods: The included clinical trials were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, and Web of Science databases, in which immunotherapy or targeted therapy was regarded as the first-line treatment for unresectable HCC, published in English between January 1, 2010, and September 20, 2022. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) from the Chinese payer’s perspective. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), the ranks of different treatments using P-score, and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated by NMA. Total costs, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-benefit ratio (ICER) were estimated from 15-year Markov models developed by CEA. Results: We identified 2,825 records, including 11,796 patients, from 15 RCTs. The NMA revealed that sintilimab plus a bevacizumab biosimilar (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.75; P = 0.96) and camrelizumab plus rivoceranib (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.66; P = 0.94) could lead to great improvements in OS and PFS compared with sorafenib-related survival. The CEA indicated that tislelizumab increased by 0.220 QALYs (0.312 LYs) and decreased by $1,938 compared with sorafenib, which yielded ICERs of -$8,809/QALY (-$2,612/LY). Sensitivity analysis showed that the model was stable. Conclusion: Sintilimab plus a bevacizumab biosimilar and camrelizumab plus rivoceranib significantly prolonged OS and PFS, respectively.

Based on usually advanced stages of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at the time of diagnosis, therapeutic options are limited and, in many cases, not effective, and typically result in the tumor recurrence with a poor prognosis. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) offers a selective internal radiation therapy approach using beta or alpha emitting radionuclides conjugated with tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), or specific selective peptides. When compared to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, radiolabeled mAbs against cancer-associated antigens could provide a high therapeutic and exclusive radiation dose for cancerous cells while decreasing the exposure-induced side effects to healthy tissues. The recent advances in cancer immunotherapy, such as blockade of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has changed the landscape of cancer therapy, and the efficacy of different classes of immunotherapy has been tested in many clinical trials. Taking into account the use of ICIs in the liver tumor microenvironment, combined therapies with different approaches may enhance the outcome in the future clinical studies. With the development of novel immunotherapy treatment options in the recent years, there has been a great deal of information about combining the diverse treatment modalities to boost the effectiveness of immunomodulatory drugs.

Date of Publication: 2023","2023","24","2","159","170","2023","Introduction: Globally, it is estimated that 290,000 patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) died from hepatitis C consequences, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in 2019. Although daclatasvir (DCV), combined with sofosbuvir (SOF), is effective in HCV patients, the new pan-genotypic combinations are considered by many as more cost-effective and successful in eradicating HCV infection. Areas covered: This review discusses the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of DCV as an HCV treatment option based on real-world studies and pharmacoeconomic evaluations. Expert opinion: Real-life studies suggest that SOF/DCV has acceptable sustained virological response and can be used successfully to manage HCV. Nonetheless, the use of SOF/DCV is limited by the longer treatment duration in genotype (GT)-3 patients and the need for ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-experienced patients which increases the likelihood of adverse effects. DCV is likely to remain as a therapeutic option for the management of GT-1, GT-2, and GT-4 patients in resource limited settings, while GT-3 patients are more likely to benefit from RBV-free direct-acting antiviral combinations such as SOF/velpatasvir for 12 weeks or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8 weeks. The introduction of generics for these new pan-genotypic drugs would likely eliminate the need for SOF/DCV in the near future.",,,36369914,L2020150835,10.1080/14656566.2022.2145883

Herein, we aimed to validate objective response as an independent predictor of OS in individuals with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving systemic anti-angiogenic therapy. Methods: We investigated the association between objective response (investigator-assessed mRECIST, independent radiologic review [IRR] mRECIST and RECIST v1.1) and OS in REFLECT, a phase III study of lenvatinib vs. sorafenib. We conducted landmark analyses (Simon-Makuch) of OS by objective response at 2, 4, and 6 months after randomization. Results: Median OS was 21.6 months (95% CI 18.6–24.5) for responders (investigator-assessed mRECIST) vs. 11.9 months (95% CI 10.7–12.8) for non-responders (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61; 95% CI 0.49–0.76; p <0.001). Objective response by IRR per mRECIST and RECIST v1.1 supported the association with OS (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.51–0.72; p <0.001 and HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.39–0.65; p <0.001, respectively). OS was significantly prolonged for responders vs. non-responders (investigator-assessed mRECIST) at the 2-month (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49–0.76; p <0.001), 4-month (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.51–0.80; p <0.001), and 6-month (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.54–0.86; p <0.001) landmarks. Results were similar when assessed by IRR, with both mRECIST and RECIST v1.1. An exploratory multivariate Cox regression analysis identified objective response by investigator-assessed mRECIST (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.44–0.68; p <0.0001) and IRR-assessed RECIST v1.1 (HR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38–0.64; p <0.0001) as independent predictors of OS in individuals with unresectable HCC. Conclusions: Objective response was an independent predictor of OS in individuals with unresectable HCC in REFLECT; additional studies are needed to confirm surrogacy. Participants achieving a complete or partial response by mRECIST or RECIST v1.1 had significantly longer survival vs. those with stable/progressive/non-evaluable disease. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01761266. Impact and implications: This analysis of data taken from a completed clinical trial (REFLECT) looked for any link between objective response and overall survival time in individuals with unresectable HCC receiving anti-angiogenic treatments. Significantly longer median overall survival was found for responders (21.6 months) vs. non-responders (11.9 months). Overall survival was also significantly longer for responders vs. non-responders (based on objective response status at 2, 4, and 6 months) in the landmark analysis. Our results indicate that objective response is an independent predictor of overall survival in this setting, confirming its validity as a rapid marker of efficacy that can be applied in phase II trials; however, further validation is required to determine is validity for other systemic treatments (e.g. immunotherapies), or as a surrogate of overall survival.",,,36341767,L2021025628,10.1016/j.jhep.2022.09.006

However, patients with Child–Pugh B HCC were excluded in the abovementioned prospective trial. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Ate/Bev in patients with Child–Pugh B HCC. Methods: This multicenter retrospective study included 36 patients with Child–Pugh B advanced HCC who received Ate/Bev at four cancer referral centers between May 2020 and August 2021. Comparative analyses were performed with an independent cohort of patients with Child–Pugh A HCC from the same registry (n = 133). Results: All patients received Ate/Bev as first-line systemic treatment for advanced HCC. The objective response and disease control rates of patients in the Child–Pugh groups B and A were 11.1% and 58.3% and 34.6% and 76.7%, respectively.

Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2023","2023","78","1","207","216","1 Jan 2023","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, in part because of inadequate early detection strategies. Current recommendations for screening consist of semi-annual abdominal ultrasound with or without serum alpha-fetoprotein in patients with cirrhosis and in demographic subgroups with chronic hepatitis B infection. However, this screening strategy has several deficiencies, including suboptimal early-stage sensitivity, false positives with subsequent harms, inter-operator variability in ultrasound performance, and poor adherence. A blood-based biomarker with sufficient performance characteristics for early-stage disease could overcome several of these barriers to improving early-stage detection. However, prior to use of a biomarker for screening in clinical practice, a multistep validation is required in order to understand test performance characteristics. These steps include case-control validation, followed by validation in prospective cohorts of at-risk patients. Until recently, we lacked adequate longitudinal validation cohorts for early HCC detection; however, several validation cohorts are maturing, including the Hepatocellular Carcinoma Early Detection Study and the Texas Hepatocellular Carcinoma Consortium, which will allow for rigorous validation of candidate biomarkers. While there are several promising biomarkers awaiting validation, in order to supplant abdominal ultrasound, a candidate biomarker must show adequate test performance and overcome practical hurdles to ensure adoption in clinical practice. The promise of blood-based biomarkers is significant, especially given the limitations of ultrasound-based screening; however, they require adequate validation and several logistical obstacles must be overcome prior to clinical implementation.",,,36089157,L2021107651,10.1016/j.jhep.2022.08.036

Recently, bariatric surgery (BS) is considered to be a novel disease-modifying therapy for NASH and liver metabolic diseases, according to clinical follow-up studies. Despite the revealment of physiopathological alterations, underlying mechanisms and key factors remain indeterminate. This study included multiple bulk RNA-sequencing datasets to investigate transcriptome variation in one-year follow-up BS and diet management (Diet) NASH patients’ liver biopsies. Liver functions, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis were predicted in liver samples via hallmark-based function enrichment analysis. Key factors generated from multi-dataset comparison were further assessed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and prognosis. BS leads to active gene expression alterations in NASH liver in comparison to diet management (Diet). Both approaches reduce cell stress and immune response, whereas BS contributes to higher metabolic levels and lower apoptosis levels. The macrophage infiltration, adipose accumulation, and fibroblast activation were revealed to be lower in post-BS NASH livers, further demonstrating positive correlations mutually. Seven key genes (MNDA, ALOX5AP, PECAM1, SPP1, CD86, FGF21, CSTA) were screened out as potential macrophage-associated and carcinogenetic factors suppressed by BS.

However, lack of phase III trial data and uncertainties around patient selection highlight the importance of multidisciplinary tumor boards (MDT) in therapeutic decision-making. This study aimed to analyze the recognition of and treatment recommendations for oligometastatic patients by MDTs at a large comprehensive cancer center in order to better understand current treatment patterns of oligometastasis. Materials and methods: For this retrospective single-center cross-sectional study, oligometastatic patients were identified by screening oncological PET and concurrent brain MRI scans conducted at our center in 2020. MDT discussions and recommendations within four weeks of the imaging diagnosis of oligometastasis were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors for the addition of local therapy to standard-of-care. Results: A total of 787 oligometastatic cases were identified. Lung cancer and mesothelioma, skin cancer, and prostate cancer were the most common histologies with 231 (29 %), 160 (20 %), and 84 (11 %) cases, respectively. Almost half of the cases (46 %) had one distant metastasis on imaging only. More than half (56 %) of all oligometastatic cases were discussed at an MDT. In 47 % of cases, for which a therapeutic recommendation was reached in an MDT, local therapy was part of the therapeutic strategy. On logistic regression analysis, oligometastatic skin cancer was significantly associated with a recommendation for local therapy (p < 0.05), whereas the number of oligometastases was not (p = 0.202). Conclusion: More than half of oligometastatic cases were discussed in MDTs, of which more than every second received a recommendation including the addition of local therapy.

Overall, the prognosis of pediatric HCC is dismal with 5-year event-free survival of <30 % as compared to >80 % for HB. Surgery approaches, either resection or transplant, remain the best chance for the cure of pediatric HCC. However, chemotherapy can be helpful as an adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment.

Obesity-associated hepatic tumorigenesis develops from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), progressing to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and ultimately to HCC. The rising incidence of obesity is resulting in an increased prevalence of NAFLD and NASH, and subsequently HCC. Obesity represents an increasingly important underlying etiology of HCC, in particular as the other leading causes of HCC such as hepatitis infection, are declining due to effective treatments and vaccines. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the molecular mechanisms and cellular signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated HCC. We summarize the preclinical experimental animal models available to study the features of NAFLD/NASH/HCC, and the non-invasive methods to diagnose NAFLD, NASH and early-stage HCC. Finally, since HCC is an aggressive tumor with a 5-year survival of less than 20%, we will also discuss novel therapeutic targets for obesity-associated HCC and ongoing clinical trials.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00994682, NCT01051219, NCT01084486, NCT01208649, NCT01963845, NCT02316717, NCT02442687, NCT02466516, NCT02510599, NCT02548351, NCT02654665, NCT02686762, NCT02704403, NCT02784444, NCT02854605, NCT02855164, NCT02856555, NCT02875821, NCT02913105, NCT02923154, NCT02927184, NCT02964715, NCT03008070, NCT03028740, NCT03053063, NCT03166735, NCT03205150, NCT03421431, NCT03436420, NCT03486899, NCT03486912, NCT03551522, NCT03617263, NCT03648554, NCT03723252, NCT03812029, NCT03900429, NCT03910361, NCT03912532, NCT03976401, NCT04048876, NCT04104321, NCT04142749, NCT04166773, NCT04267393, NCT04328077, NCT04365868, NCT04483947, NCT04583423, NCT04697810, NCT04771273, NCT04801849, NCT04822181, NCT04906421, NCT05284448, NCT05513729, NCT05644717)",,,L2023947060,10.3389/fendo.2023.1148934

Date of Publication: 2023","2023","15",,"707","717","2023","At present, the average five-year survival rate of liver cancer in China is only 12.1%. The reason for this association lies in the diagnosis at its middle or/and advanced stage of liver cancer for lacking special clinical symptoms in almost 70% of patients without the chance of effective surgical resection. Epidemiological studies have shown that there are only 30% of patients with an initial diagnosis of liver cancer have the opportunity to undergo radical surgery. Therefore, systematic and comprehensive treatment would play an important role in liver cancer treatment at its middle or/and advanced stage, and the related therapeutic schedule still needs further improvement and optimization. We applied a gene-targeted drug of Icaritin soft capsule in the treatment of a liver cancer patient at its advanced stage. And the level of AFP was found to decrease to 6.4ng/mL from 10.86ng/mL; meanwhile, MRI showed that the primary tumor significantly reduced in size, with shrinking of the hepatogastric space, hepatic aortic side, and renal artery side lymph nodes. After treatment with TACE and Icaritin, the patient had no discomfort and no longer experienced abdominal pain and bloating and gained three kilograms of weight. The therapeutic effect of Icaritin-targeted drugs was completely demonstrated during the later treatment follow-up. That is to say, the multiple anti-tumor characteristics of Icaritin with good safety were fully displayed in this case, and it can be used in combination with other drugs to treat hepatocellular carcinoma in the clinical setting.

Date of Publication: 2023","2023","14",,,,"2023","Purpose: Results from the LAUNCH trial suggest transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with lenvatinib is significantly more effective than lenvatinib as a first-line treatment option for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the cost of TACE is substantial. This study compares the cost-effectiveness of TACE in combination with lenvatinib (TACE-LEN) with that of lenvatinib alone as the first-line treatment for advanced HCC from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. Methods: Markov models of different health states were constructed to simulate first-line treatment, disease progression, and survival in patients with advanced HCC. Clinical efficacy was obtained from the LAUNCH trial. The cost of drugs was sourced from national tender prices, and the treatment cost of weight-decreased was obtained from the Fujian Provincial Bureau of Prices. Other costs and utility values were based on the published literature. Total costs, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) comprised the model output. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to validate model robustness and subgroup analyses were also conducted. Results: Analysis of the model showed that compared to lenvatinib, TACE-LEN improved effectiveness by 1.60 QALYs at a total cost increase of $48,874.69, with an ICER value of $30,482.13/QALY. A one-way sensitivity analysis found that the progression-free survival utility value per year had the greatest impact on the model. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that TACE-LEN had a 97.9% probability of being cost-effective as the first-line treatment option for advanced HCC compared to lenvatinib when the willingness-to-pay (WTP) value was $38,201/QALY (three times the Chinese GDP per capita in 2022). Subgroup analysis showed that all subgroups of patients preferred TACE-LEN. However, when the WTP threshold was below $30,300/QALY, TACE-LEN is no longer cost-effective. Conclusion: Our study found TACE-LEN to be a cost-effective treatment option for patients with advanced HCC compared to lenvatinib from a Chinese healthcare system perspective, but not so in low-income provinces in China.",,,,L2025514209,10.3389/fphar.2023.1219694

Therefore, we designed a double-arm retrospective study to evaluate the antitumour activity of additional bevacizumab (Beva, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor-targeting drug) as a means to reduce the blood vessels needed for tumour growth. Compared with the control group, the group that received Beva had prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and a trend toward a benefit for overall survival duration. This study aimed to evaluate the anticancer effect of Beva in patients with aHCC who experienced tumour progression after treatment with Lenva+ICIs.

The median OS was 12.6 mo (95% CI: 6.8-18.7) vs. 9.3 mo (95% CI: 4.3-14.4), and the median PFS was 6.9 mo (95% CI: 6.4-7.4) vs. 4.1 mo (95% CI: 2.4-5.8). The ORR for all patients was 5%, and the DCR for all patients was 70.0%. The median follow-up time for all patients was 7.5 mo (95% CI: 5.0-10.0). All patients had adverse events, but no fatal adverse events were observed. In conclusion, Bevacizumab is a drug resistant treatment option for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma after Lenva+PD-1/PD-L1 treatment.",,,,L2026851855,
"Comparative efficacy and safety of systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and network meta-analysis","Wu D., Jia B., Jia M., Zhao H., Zhao H., Zhou J.","Frontiers in Oncology (2023) 13 Article Number: 1274754. Date of Publication: 2023","2023","13",,,,"2023","Background: In recent years, there has been rapid development in systemic therapeutic agents for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, most treatment modalities lack head-to-head comparisons, and the distinctions in their efficacy and safety have yet to be elucidated. Consequently, the accurate selection of a treatment regimen poses a significant challenge for clinicians. Methods: This study incorporated twenty-three randomized controlled trials, encompassing fifteen first-line and eight second-line treatments, and involving a total of 14,703 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Results: In the context of first-line treatment, it was observed that the combination of a PD-1 inhibitor with bevacizumab (1/15) significantly extended overall survival in patients with advanced HCC. Furthermore, PD-1 inhibitors combined with TKIs (1/15) and PD-1 inhibitors combined with bevacizumab (2/15) exhibited enhanced efficacy in reducing the risk of progression-free survival events. In second-line therapy, the network meta-analysis revealed that all investigational agents prolonged progression-free survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma when compared to placebo. Cabozantinib ranked first (1/7) in this regard. However, this translated into an overall survival benefit only for cabozantinib, regorafenib, ramucirumab, and pembrolizumab, with regorafenib achieving the highest ranking (1/7). Conclusion: In the treatment of advanced HCC, the immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with bevacizumab regimen and the immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with TKI regimen stand out as the two most effective first-line treatment options. It is noteworthy that, for patients with absolute contraindications to VEGF inhibitors, dual immunotherapy is the preferred choice. For second-line treatment, regorafenib and cabozantinib are identified as the two most effective options.

Patients and Methods: This multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label prospective study was conducted at 10 medical facilities in Japan (jRCTs031190017). Eligible patients had advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and were suitable for lenvatinib therapy. The study included patients with high tumor burden (with >50% intrahepatic tumor volume, main portal vein invasion, or bile duct invasion), Child-Pugh B status, and receiving lenvatinib as second-line therapy following atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Results: From December 2019 to September 2021, 59 patients were analyzed (47 and 12 patients with Child-Pugh A and B, respectively). In patients with Child-Pugh A, the frequency of aspartate aminotransferase elevation was high (72.7%) in the high-burden group. No other significant ad verse events (AE) were observed even in second-line treatment. However, patients with Child-Pugh B had high incidence of grade ≥3 AE (100.0%) and high discontinuation rates caused by AE (33.3%) compared with patients with Child-Pugh A (80.9% and 17.0%, respectively). Median progression-free survival was 6.4 and 2.5 months and median overall survival was 19.7 and 4.1 months in Child-Pugh A and B, respectively. Lenvatinib plasma concentration was higher in patients with Child-Pugh B on days 8 and 15 and correlated with dose modifications and lower relative dose intensity. Conclusions: Lenvatinib is safe and effective for advanced HCC in patients with Child-Pugh A, even with high tumor burden. However, it carries a higher risk of AE and may not provide adequate efficacy for patients with Child-Pugh B status.","",,37796614,L2028973093,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-1462

Results & Conclusions Baseline characteristics in the subgroups were similar across treatment arms. In ALBI grade 1 patients, mOS (95 %CI) was 23.43 months (19.19-28.75) with STRIDE, 21.16 months (17.38-25.86) with durva-lumab, and 19.02 months (15.67-23.16) with sorafenib; 36-month OS rates were 38.0 %, 27.0 %, and 27.3 %, respectively.

Date of Publication: 2023","2023","51",,"41","42","2023","Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer and third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent liver cancer, comprises 80-90% of all liver cancers and has a dismal prognosis, especially when people are diagnosed at an advanced stage with poor performance status and decompensated liver cirrhosis. Approximately 22% of patients with unresectable HCC are alive at 3 years. HBV is highly associated with HCC in Asia and Africa, while HCV is highly associated with HCC in the west and Japan. Although anti-HCV treatment has had some success, HCV prevalence is increasing. While alcohol is a key risk factor for development of HCC in the west, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with obesity/diabetes is also an emerging risk factor for HCC. For many years the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma was based on poorly effective chemotherapy, with no evidence of prolongation of OS in a series of studies. The first statistically significant prolongation of OS compared to placebo was demonstrated in the Sharp study, after which sorafenib became and remained the standard of treatment in the first line for a long time. IMbrave150 investigates a combination anti-VEGF bevacizumab + anti-PD-L1 atezolizumab, and HIMALAYA anti-CTLA-4 tremelimumab + anti-PD-L1 durvalumab. The trials resulted in similar landmark overall survival, significantly better than sorafenib, previous standard 1st line treatment. TKIs are still a treatment option for some patients in the first line (sorafenib and lenvatinib, which showed that it is not worse than sorafenib in a non-inferiority study), and certainly in the second line, as well as for cabozantinib and regorafenib. Although we are still waiting for reliable data on the effectiveness of TKIs after immunotherapy combinations. Billiary tract cancer (BTC) is a rare and aggressive heterogeneous cancer with poor prognosis, comprising intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and ampulla of Vater. For patients with unresectable or metastatic BTC, first-line SoC GemCis remained unchanged for over a decade and provides a median OS of <1 year. In the TOPAZ study durvalumab plus GemCis showed a statistically significant improvement in OS compared with placebo plus GemCis, with a long-term survival benefit, as well as improvements in prespecified secondary endpoints including PFS and ORR. The addition of durvalumab to GemCis demonstrated manageable safety, did not add to the toxicity that was observed with GemCis and showed no detriment in QoL versus placebo plus GemCis in participants with advanced BTC. The survival benefit observed with the addition of durvalumab to Gem-Cis was consistent across all subgroups analysed in the TOPAZ-1 study, including in participants with clinically actionable alterations. Nearly 40% of patients with BTC harbour genetic alterations which are potential targets for precision medicine. Therefore, molecular analysis should be carried out before or during first-line therapy to evaluate options for second and higher lines of treatment. The most common clinically relevant mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 are present in ∼10%-20% of patients with iCCA. Ivosidenib is an oral inhibitor of the mutant IDH1 enzyme and to date is the only targeted agent that has successfully completed a phase III trial in CCA. The ClarIDHy study showed that ivosidenib significantly improved PFS and OS. After phase 2 Fight-202 study showing clear survival benefit, pemigatinib was approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement that have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. In conclusion, the treatment landscape is continuously evolving to improve outcomes in patients with unresectable HCC and BCC, with recent advances observed with immunotherapy combinations.",,,,L642728166,

We compared the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sorafenib as a first-line treatment in younger versus older patients with unresectable HCC. Methods: This global, phase 3, open-label, randomized clinical trial (IMbrave150) recruited patients aged ≥18 years with locally advanced metastatic or unresectable HCC, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1, and Child-Pugh class A liver function who had not previously received systemic therapy for liver cancer. Patients received either 1,200 mg atezolizumab plus 15 mg/kg bevacizumab intravenously every 3 weeks or 400 mg sorafenib orally twice daily until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes were the incidence of adverse events and time to deterioration of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). This subgroup analysis evaluated safety and efficacy endpoints in patients <65 years, ≥65 to <75 years, and ≥75 years. Results: Of 501 patients, 165 patients were randomized to sorafenib and 336 were randomized to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (175 patients <65 years; 106 patients ≥65 to <75 years; 55 patients ≥75 years). Across all age groups, patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab had longer median OS (<65: 18.0 vs. 12.2 months [HR, 0.57; 95% CI: 0.40-0.82]; ≥65 to <75: 19.4 vs. 14.9 months [HR, 0.80; 95% CI: 0.52-1.23]; ≥75: 24.0 vs. 18.0 months [HR, 0.72, 95% CI: 0.37-1.41]) and PFS than those receiving sorafenib. Time to deterioration for multiple PROs was delayed for patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, including older adults. There were no clinically meaningful differences in toxicity between age groups. Conclusion: Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is safe and effective in adults <65, ≥65 to <75, and ≥75.

In a prospective clinical study we led, neoadjuvant sintilimab has led to major and complete pathologic responses, which are recommended as surrogate endpoints for neoadjuvant immunotherapy; however, its effect remains inconclusive in pulmonary ground glass nodules. Meanwhile, combination plans seem more likely to be satisfying therapeutic options. Specifically, sintilimab plus platinum-based chemotherapy plans conferred better anti-tumor efficacy and clinical benefits compared to chemotherapy alone, which led to their approval in China and the acceptance of a biological license application in the US. Besides, the combination with other plans, such as docetaxel, cytokine-induced killer cell immunotherapy, radiation therapy, and anlotinib have also shown promising anti-tumor efficacy, with acceptable toxicities, and are therefore worth further exploration. In addition, several clinical trials on NSCLC at our center are ongoing. In general, sintilimab and its combinatorial plans were effective and well tolerated, but the treatment requires appropriate timing; pathologic responses can be surrogate endpoints for neoadjuvant immunotherapy, while more effective biomarkers are warranted.

However, it often leads to a poor prognosis and decreased hepatic function especially in patients with BCLC substage B2. Lenvatinib (LEN) was demonstrated to be efficacious in these patients in the REFLECT phase 3 trial. We therefore aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LEN as a first-line treatment for the patients with HCC at BCLC substage B2. Methods: This prospective observational study used LEN in TACE-naïve patients with HCC at BCLC substage B2 and preserved hepatic function. The primary endpoint was overall survival. A one-year survival rate threshold of 60% and an expected survival rate of 78%, based on previous reports of TACE, was assumed for setting the sample size. With a one-sided α-type error of 5% and 70% detection power, 25 patients were required over a 2-year enrollment period and 10-month follow-up period. Results: Thirty-one patients were enrolled in this study from June 2018 to June 2020. The 1-year survival rate was 71.0% (90% confidence interval, 68.4–73.6%). Median overall and progression-free survival periods were 17.0 and 10.4 months, and the objective response rates according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) version 1.1 and modified RECIST criteria were 22.6% and 70.0%, respectively. Common adverse events (AEs) were fatigue (68%), hypertension (65%), anorexia (61%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (39%), and thrombocytopenia (32%) of any grade; aspartate aminotransferase increased (23%), alanine aminotransferase increased (16%), and grade ≥ 3 proteinuria (13%).

In this review, we summarize and discuss the latest findings regarding CSC niche morphology, physical terrain, main signaling pathways and interactions within them. The cellular and molecular components of CSCs also involve genetic and epigenetic modulations that mediate and support their maintenance, ultimately leading to cancer progression. It suggests that the crosstalk between CSCs and their niche plays an important role regarding therapy resistance and recurrence. In addition, we updated diverse therapeutic strategies in different cancers in basic research and clinical trials in this review. Understanding the complex heterogeneity of CSC niches is a necessary pre-requisite for designing superior therapeutic strategies to target CSC-specific factors and/or components of the CSC niche.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00700258, NCT00756717, NCT01267955, NCT01277146, NCT01401062, NCT01728805, NCT01764477, NCT01876251, NCT01878617, NCT01973309, NCT02120469, NCT02187302, NCT02383498, NCT02523014, NCT02667574, NCT02836600, NCT03055286, NCT03422679, NCT03513211, NCT03531827, NCT03645980, NCT04018872, NCT04057365, NCT04177810, NCT04195399, NCT04363801, NCT04481100, NCT04517292, NCT05087212, NCT05199584)",,35659296,L2017619586,10.1186/s13287-022-02904-1

NASH, an advanced form of NAFL, can be progressive and more susceptible to developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, lifestyle interventions are the most essential and effective strategies for preventing and controlling NAFL without the development of fibrosis. While there are still limited appropriate drugs specifically to treat NAFL/NASH, growing progress is being seen in elucidating the pathogenesis and identifying therapeutic targets. In this review, we discussed recent developments in etiology and prospective therapeutic targets, as well as pharmacological candidates in pre/clinical trials and patents, with a focus on diabetes, hepatic lipid metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis. Importantly, growing evidence elucidates that the disruption of the gut–liver axis and microbe-derived metabolites drive the pathogenesis of NAFL/NASH. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) act as a signaling mediator, resulting in lipid accumulation, macrophage and hepatic stellate cell activation, further promoting inflammation and liver fibrosis progression during the development of NAFL/NASH. Targeting gut microbiota or EVs may serve as new strategies for the treatment of NAFL/NASH. Finally, other mechanisms, such as cell therapy and genetic approaches, also have enormous therapeutic potential. Incorporating drugs with different mechanisms and personalized medicine may improve the efficacy to better benefit patients with NAFL/NASH.","ClinicalTrials.gov (00160407, 00388180, 00529204, 00994682, 01055340, 01208649, 01237119, 01260246, 01373450, 01694849, 02068339, 02279407, 02303730, 02354976, 02453711, 02633956, 02637973, 02654665, 02686476, 02696941, 02704403, 02781584, 02856555, 02876796, 02964715, 02970942, 03008070, 03061721, 03131687, 03235050, 03350165, 03449446, 03551522, 03646292, 03723252, 03744182, 03938246, 03950882, 03976401, 04019561, 04104321, 04142749, 04505436, 04639414, 04679376, 04771273, 04849728, 04906421)",,35963848,L2018639856,10.1038/s41392-022-01119-3

Sorafenib used to be the main treatment for unresectable HCC patients. However, regimens based on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have attracted attention in recent years because of their reported benefits. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of monotherapy and combination therapy of ICIs as first-line treatment for unresectable HCC patients by conducting a systematic review, meta-analysis, and network meta-analysis. Methods: Studies published up to 11st August 2022 were searched from 4 commonly used databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Clinical trials.gov. All eligible clinical trials were included. Data about reported objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were extracted. Results: Of the 8579 studies retrieved, 24 met the inclusion criteria. In patients with unresectable HCC taking ICIs-based therapy as first-line treatment, the pooled result of median PFS and median OS was 5.76 months (95% CI 4.82–6.69) and 16.35 months (95% CI 15.19–17.51) The ORR and DCR were 25.1% (95% CI 20.8–29.5%) and 75.2% (95% CI 70.3–80.2%) measured by RECIST v1.1 or 40.2% (95% CI 31.7–48.6%) with 75.2% (95% CI 68.3–82.1%) measured by mRECIST v1.1. Compared to sorafenib, ICIs-based therapy significantly prolonged OS. The combination treatment of sintilimab plus IBI305 had the highest ORR, while atezolizumab plus bevacizumab had the highest DCR. The pooled incidence of any grade TRAEs was 82.3% (95% CI 73.9–90.7%), with highest incidence appeared in dysphonia. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that first-line ICIs-based therapies could provide survival benefits for patients with unresectable HCC, with manageable TRAEs.

Although the response to targeted therapies for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is acceptable with the improved survival, the high tumor recurrence rate and drug-related side effects continue to be problematic. Given that immune checkpoint inhibitor alone are not robust enough to improve survival in unresectable HCC, growing evidence supports the combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy with synergistic effect. Methods: Online databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched for the studies that compared targeted monotherapy with the combination therapy of targeted drug and checkpoint inhibitors in unresectable HCC patients. Eligibility criteria were the presence of at least one measurable lesion as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1) for unresectable HCC patients, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2, and a Child–Pugh score ≤ 7. Outcome measurements include overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treatment-related adverse event (TRAE). Results: Three phase II/III randomized controlled trials were included in this study. The pooled results showed that combination therapy significantly improved survival than targeted monotherapy, in terms of OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.50–0.91) and PFS (HR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.51–0.67), respectively. In the incidence of grade 3–5 TRAEs, the combination therapy was significantly higher than targeted monotherapy (odds ratio = 1.98; 95% CI: 1.13–3.48).

Surprisingly, disruption of TGF-β signaling results in both anti-cancer and pro-tumoral phenotypes in experimental cancer models, revealing the unexpected complexity of its downstream pathways for mediating cancer progression. Thus, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of TGF-β signaling at the molecular level can bring new insights for developing medications that can precisely separate the anti-cancer actions from the tumor-promoting outcomes.

REACH-2 China study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab in Chinese patients with advanced HCC (NCT02435433). Methods: REACH-2 China was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study done at 31 centres in China between Sep 16, 2015, and March 15, 2021. Patients with advanced HCC and AFP ≥400 ng/mL after first-line sorafenib were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive ramucirumab 8 mg/kg intravenously or placebo Q2W, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was OS. Efficacy was assessed per intention-to-treat, and safety in patients who received any treatment. Findings: Of 104 Chinese patients enrolled (44 in the global study and 60 in the China extension study), 70 received ramucirumab and 34 received placebo. Median OS was 9·1 months in the ramucirumab group and 6·2 months in the placebo group (HR = 0·854 [95% CI: 0·536, 1·359]).

The hypothesis of this study was that overall survival (OS) would improve with SBRT followed by sorafenib (SBRT/S) vs. sorafenib alone (S), in patients with advanced HCC. Materials/Methods: Eligible patients had new or recurrent HCC, unsuitable for resection, transplant, ablation or TACE, with Zubrod performance status (PS) 0-2, Child-Pugh A, intermediate (B) or advanced (C) Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage (BCLC), ≤ 5 HCCs, sum of hepatic HCCs ≤ 20 cm, and sum of extrahepatic metastases ≤ 3 cm. Patients were randomized 1:1 to S 400 mg BID vs. SBRT (27.5-50Gy in 5 fractions, with dose individualized based on mean liver dose and other dose constraints) followed by S 200 mg BID then increased to 400 mg BID after 28 days if appropriate. Primary endpoint was OS. Reported secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and adverse events (AEs - CTCAEv4). Planned sample size was 292 patients (238 OS events, HR=0.72, 80% power, 1-sided alpha=0.05). Accrual closed early, primarily due to a change in HCC standard of care systemic therapy. Statistics were amended to report data as of 7/1/2022, projecting 155 OS events providing 65% power for the original hypothesis, with the same alpha. OS and PFS were estimated by Kaplan-Meier and arms compared using log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze treatment effect. TTP was estimated with cumulative incidence and arms compared using Gray's test. Secondary endpoints were tested with 2-sided alpha=0.05. Results: Of 193 patients accrued from April 2013 to March 2021 from 23 sites, 177 eligible patients were randomized to S (n=92) vs. SBRT/S (n=85). Median age was 66 years (27-84); 41% had Hepatitis C and 19% had Hepatitis B or B/C. The majority were stage BCLC C (82%), with macrovascular invasion (74%). 4% had metastases. Median follow-up for all and alive patients was 13.2 and 33.7 months, respectively. With 153 OS events, median OS was improved from 12.3 months (90% CI 10.6, 14.3) with S to 15.8 months (90% CI 11.4-19.2) with SBRT/S (HR=0.77, 1-sided p=0.0554). After adjusting for PS, M stage, Child Pugh A5 vs. 6, and degree of vascular HCC, OS was statistically significantly improved for SBRT/S (HR=0.72, 95% CI 0.52-0.99, 2-sided Cox p=0.042). Median PFS was improved from 5.5 months (95% CI 3.4-6.3) with S to 9.2 months (95% CI 7.5-11.9) with SBRT/S (HR=0.55, 95% CI 0.40-0.75, 2-sided p=0.0001). TTP was also improved with SBRT/S (HR=0.69, 95% CI 0.48-0.998, 2-sided Gray's p=0.034). Treatment-related grade 3+ AEs were not significantly different (S - 42%, SBRT/S - 47%; p=0.52). There was one grade 5 treatment-related AE, in the S arm.

Whereas penicillamine is used therapeutically to re-establish copper balance, trientine is indicated for patients with penicillamine intolerance. We aimed to compare penicillamine with trientine tetrahydrochloride (TETA4) for maintenance therapy in patients with Wilson disease. Methods: We conducted a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial at 15 health-care centres across nine countries (patients were recruited from 13 of these health-care centres across Brazil, Europe, and the USA). We enrolled patients aged 18–75 years with stable Wilson disease who were treated for at least 1 year with penicillamine. Patients entered a 12-week period to determine stability through clinical assessment by site investigators and predefined thresholds for serum non-caeruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC; by an exchangeable copper assay; 25–150 μg/L), 24 h urinary copper excretion (100–900 μg/24 h), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT; <2 × upper limit of normal). Stable patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to continue receiving the maintenance twice daily dose of oral penicillamine or switched mg-for-mg to oral TETA4 centrally with a web-based system using minimisation. The primary endpoint, assessed 24 weeks after randomisation, was NCC by speciation assay. The non-inferiority margin of mean difference in NCC by speciation assay was –50 μg/L, as estimated by a general linear model for repeated visits, adjusted for baseline values. Further data on safety and efficacy were collected during a 24-week extension period. Data were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03539952 (active, not recruiting). Findings: Between June 4, 2018, and March 10, 2020, 77 patients were screened. 53 patients were randomly assigned (27 to the penicillamine group and 26 to the TETA4 group). After 24 weeks, the mean difference in serum NCC by speciation assay between the penicillamine group and TETA4 group was –9·1 μg/L (95% CI –24·2 to 6·1), with the lower limit of the 95% CI within the defined non-inferiority margin. At 24 weeks, urinary copper excretion was lower with TETA4 than with penicillamine (mean difference 237·5 μg/24 h (99% CI 115·6 to 359·4). At 48 weeks, TETA4 remained non-inferior to penicillamine in terms of NCC by speciation assay (mean difference NCC −15·5 μg/L [95% CI –34·5 to 3·6]). Urinary copper excretion at 48 weeks remained in the expected range for well treated patients in both study groups, and the mean difference (124·8 μg/24 h [99% CI –37·6 to 287·1]) was not significantly different. At 24 weeks and 48 weeks, masked clinical adjudication of stability assessed by three independent clinicians confirmed clinical stability (100%) of all participants, in agreement with the stability seen with the NCC by speciation assay. There were no notable changes in either the Clinical Global Impression of Change or Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (neurological assessment) from baseline (pre-randomisation) at weeks 24 and 48. The mean change in serum total copper from baseline to 24 weeks was 17·6 μg/L (99% CI –9·5 to 44·7) with penicillamine and –6·3 μg/L (–34·7 to 22·1) with TETA4, and the mean change in serum total caeruloplasmin from baseline to 24 weeks was 1·8 mg/L (–19·2 to 22·8) with penicillamine and –2·2 mg/L (–6·1 to 1·7) with TETA4. All liver enzymes were similar at 24 weeks and 48 weeks, with the exception of elevated ALT concentration at 48 weeks for patients in the TETA4 group. Penicillamine was associated with three post-randomisation serious adverse events (leukopenia, cholangiocarcinoma, and hepatocellular cancer); none were reported for TETA4. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were headache for penicillamine (five [19%] of 27 patients vs two [8%] of 26) and abdominal pain for TETA4 (one [4%] vs four [15%]); all treatment-emergent adverse events resolved and were mild to moderate. One patient developed a rash with TETA4 that resolved on discontinuation of therapy. Interpretation: The efficacy of TETA4 as oral maintenance therapy was non-inferior to penicillamine and well tolerated in adults with Wilson disease.

Anlotinib was a novel oral multi-targeted TKI selective for VEGF receptors 1/2/3, FGF receptors 1-4, PDGF receptors α and β, and c-kit. Penpulimab, a humanized anti-PD-1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, was engineered to eliminate FcγR binding, consequently eliminating ADCC, ADCP and ADCR effects. This AK105-203 trial (NCT04172571) aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of penpulimab plus anlotinib in patients (pts) with histologically or cytologically confirmed uHCC. Methods: In this single-arm, multicenter phase Ib/II trial, pts with uHCC and no prior systemic treatment were eligible if they were 18-75 years, and classified as BCLC stage B (not amenable for locoregional therapy) or C, Child-Pugh score ≤7 and ECOG PS of 0-1.

Results: 31 pts (median age 56 years [23-74], ECOG 0/1 [64%/36%], BCLC B/C [23%/77%], HBV/HCV [61%/7%]) received combined therapy. As of August 5, 2022, median follow-up time was 23.0 months (range 3.7-31.9). The ORR was 31.0% (95% CI, 15.3-50.8%), and DCR was 82.8% (95% CI, 64.2-94.2%). The median PFS and TTP for 31 patients were 8.8 months (95% CI, 4.0-12.3) and 8.8 months (95% CI, 4.0-14) respectively. OS events were observed in 16 patients (51.6%), and the median OS was 23.0 months with 12-months OS rate was 67.9%. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 90.3% of pts (≥G3 in 25.8% [8/31]). No G5 AE occurred.

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2022","2022","16",,,,"1 Dec 2022","Background: Atezo (anti–PD-L1) IV is approved in NSCLC, SCLC, triple-negative breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma and unresectable/metastatic melanoma. To reduce treatment burden and improve convenience and efficiencies in healthcare, a novel fixed-dose atezo SC co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase is being developed. We report Part 2 (Phase III) of the open-label, randomized, multicentre IMscin001 study (NCT03735121) to investigate non-inferiority of drug exposure at Cycle 1 after atezo SC vs IV administration in NSCLC. Methods: Adults with previously treated locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC (no prior cancer immunotherapy) and ECOG PS 0 or 1 were randomised 2:1 to receive 2L atezo SC (1875 mg) or IV (1200 mg) every 3 weeks. Primary endpoints: non-inferiority for Cycle 1 observed serum C(trough) and model-predicted AUC(0-21 days); secondary endpoints: steady-state PK, safety, efficacy (PFS, ORR), patient-reported outcomes, immunogenicity. Results: There were 247 and 124 patients in the atezo SC and IV arms, respectively (median follow-up: 4.6 mo; data cut-off: 26 Apr 2022). Median age was 64.0 years (range 27–85), 69% were male and 74% had ECOG PS 1. The lower bounds of the 90% CI of the geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for C(trough) (GMR 1.05 [90% CI: 0.88, 1.24]) and AUC (GMR 0.87 [90% CI: 0.83, 0.92]) were above the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.8. Efficacy, immunogenicity and safety were similar between arms (Table). [Formula presented] Conclusions: Atezo SC demonstrated non-inferior exposure vs IV for both co-primary PK endpoints. Efficacy and safety were similar between arms and consistent with the known atezo IV profile; atezo immunogenicity was comparable between arms and within the historical range for atezo IV across indications. These results support atezo SC as an alternative to IV. Clinical trial identification: NCT03735121.

TIS, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, has shown anti-tumor activity in HCC. LEN is a multikinase inhibitor approved for the first-line treatment of uHCC. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TIS plus LEN in pts with uHCC. Methods: Systemic treatment-naïve pts with uHCC received TIS (200 mg, IV, Q3W) and LEN (body weight ≥60 kg: 12 mg; <60 kg: 8 mg, PO, QD). Tolerability evaluated by assessing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the first 6 pts (Part 1) was the premise of the remaining enrollment (Part 2). Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC) per RECIST v1.1. Based on the Simon’s two-stage design, >6 responders were needed in stage 1 (n=30) to continue, and ≥18 responders were needed by the end of stage 2 (n=60) to claim statistical superiority to a historical control of 18.8% (from LEN arm of phase III REFLECT study) (α and β errors of 0.05). Results: A total of 64 pts were enrolled and received TIS plus LEN (Part 1, n=6; Part 2, n=58) with 73.4% in BCLC stage C. As of 7 July 2022 (median follow-up, 12.5 months), 21.9% pts were on treatment. No DLTs were observed in the first 6 pts. The study met the statistical superiority criteria. There were 24 responders assessed by IRC per RECIST v1.1 in the efficacy evaluable analysis set (n=62). Confirmed ORR and DCR were 38.7% (95% CI, 26.6-51.9) and 90.3% (95% CI, 80.1-96.4), respectively (Table).

Local ablation, such as radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, cryoablation and irreversible electroporation, etc., are well established in elimination and control of HCC. However, high recurrence rate after local ablation remains the biggest challenge for HCC management. Novel and effective therapeutic strategies to improve long-term survival are urgently needed. Accumulating studies have reported the role of ablation in modulating the tumor signaling pathway and the immune microenvironment to both eliminate residual/metastatic tumor and promote tumor progression. Ablation has been shown to elicit tumor-specific immune responses by inducing massive cell death and releasing tumor antigen. Immunotherapies that unleash the immune system have the potential to enhance the anti-tumor immunity induced by ablation. Multiple combinatory strategies have been explored in preclinical and clinical studies. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the latest progress on different mechanisms underlying the effects of ablation on tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. We further analyze the clinical trials testing the combination of ablation and immunotherapies, and discuss the possible role of immunomodulation to boost the anti-tumor effects of ablation and prevent HCC recurrence.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01853618, NCT02821754, NCT03337841, NCT03383458, NCT03630640, NCT03753659, NCT03847428, NCT03864211, NCT03867084, NCT03939975, NCT04102098, NCT04150744, NCT04220944, NCT04652440)",,36505437,L2020468434,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1033000

In unresectable HCC patients, transcatheter arterial (chemo-) embolization (TAE/TACE) has shown a disease response in 15-55% of cases. Though multiple TAE/TACE courses can be administered in principle, Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as an alternative option in the case of local relapse following multiple TAE/TACE courses. Methods: This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel-group superiority trial of SBRT versus standard TAE/TACE for the curative treatment of the intermediate stage of HCC after an incomplete response following TAE/TACE (NCT02323360). The primary endpoint is 1-year local control (LC): 18 events were needed to assess a 45% difference (HR: 0.18) in favor of SBRT. The secondary endpoints are 1-year Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Distant Recurrence-Free Survival (DRFS), Overall Survival (OS) and the incidence of acute and late complications. Results: At the time of the final analysis, 40 patients were enrolled, 19 (49%) in the TAE/TACE arm and 21 (51%) in the SBRT arm. The trial was prematurely closed due to slow accrual. The 1- and 2-year LC rates were 57% and 36%. The use of SBRT resulted in superior LC as compared to TAE/TACE rechallenge (median not reached versus 8 months, p = 0.0002). PFS was 29% and 16% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. OS was 86% and 62% at 1 year and 2 years, respectively. In the TAE arm, PFS was 13% and 6% at 1 and 2 years, respectively.

The Phase 3 HOPE-B clinical trial (NCT03569891) of etranacogene dezaparvovec met its primary efficacy endpoint, providing hemostatic protection superior to standard of care FIX prophylaxis over 52 weeks of follow-up after stable FIX Padua expression (defined as Months 7-18). However, the potential for liver-directed AAV to sustain long-term clotting factor expression remains unknown, with most human experience derived from early phase clinical trials. Aim: Efficacy and safety data is provided from the pivotal Phase 3 HOPE-B clinical trial over a period of 24 months of gene expression. Methods: In this open-label, single-arm study, adult male participants with severe or moderately severe hemophilia B (FIX≤2%), with or without pre-existing AAV5 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), were infused with a single dose of etranacogene dezaparvovec (2x10(13) gc/kg), following a ≥6-month lead-in period receiving FIX prophylaxis. FIX activity, annualized bleed rate (ABR), and FIX infusions were assessed frequently during the lead-in and first 12 months after receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec, then every 6 months during the long-term follow-up (Years 2-5). Adverse events (AEs) were recorded continuously. Results: Of the 54 participants who received etranacogene dezaparvovec, 53 participants received the full dose and 52 completed 24 months of follow-up. At 464 days (~15 months) following infusion, one 75-year-old participant died from cardiogenic shock, preceded by a urinary tract infection, which was considered unrelated to treatment. Of the 54 participants, 52 (96.3%) discontinued and remained free of continuous FIX prophylaxis from Day 21 to Month 24, including 20 participants with baseline AAV5 NAb titers up to 1:700. One participant with a markedly higher AAV5 NAbs titer (1:3212) and one participant who received only a partial vector dose (due to an infusion-related reaction) did not express FIX Padua or discontinue FIX prophylaxis. Compared with the ≥6-month lead-in period (mean ABR 4.18), mean ABR for all bleeds during Months 7-24 post-treatment was significantly reduced by 64% (mean ABR 1.51; p=0.0002), sustaining the same bleed reduction that satisfied the primary endpoint of the trial during Months 7-18. The mean ABR for all other bleed types was also substantially reduced (Figure 1). The mean FIX activity level of participants was 39.0 IU/dL (standard deviation [SD]: ±18.7; min-max: 8.2-97.1) at Month 6 (n=51) and sustained at 36.7 IU/dL (±19.0; 4.7-99.2) at Month 24 post-treatment (n=50; Figure 2). There was an overall 96% reduction in mean unadjusted annualized FIX consumption from the lead-in period (257,339 IU/year/participant) to Months 19-24 (9751 IU/year/participant; p<0.0001). During the 24 months post-dose, all participants experienced at least one treatment-emergent AE (TEAE); of the 557 events, 424 (76%) were mild, 115 (21%) were moderate, and 18 (3%) were severe. A total of 38 participants (70.4%) experienced 93 treatment-related TEAEs, with only one occurring during Months 18-24. There was an increase in alanine transaminase (with or without increased aspartate transaminase) in eleven participants (20.4%). Nine participants (16.7%) received supportive care with reactive corticosteroids for a mean duration of 79.8 days (SD: 26.6; range: 51-130 days). There were no serious AEs related to treatment; a serious AE of hepatocellular carcinoma was determined by independent molecular genomic and integration analysis to be unrelated to treatment. Conclusions: Demonstrating durability of disease correction with acceptable safety is the next major hurdle for gene therapy in people with hemophilia B. After 24 months’ follow-up, single-dose etranacogene dezaparvovec resulted in stable FIX Padua expression in participants with AAV NAb undetected or <1:700 titer; reduction in ABR remained durable and superior to FIX prophylaxis. This outcome was achieved with limited early reactive corticosteroid exposure in a minority of participants, allowing all participants who discontinued prophylaxis to remain off prophylaxis at Month 24.

Most HCC patients are diagnosed at the advanced stage and multikinase inhibitors have been the only treatment choice for them. Recently, the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has provided a new therapeutic strategy for HCC. It is noteworthy that the positive outcomes of the phase III clinical trial IMBrave150 [atezolizumab (anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 antibody) combined with bevacizumab (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody)], showed that overall survival and progression-free survival were significantly better with sorafenib. This combination therapy has become the new standard therapy for advanced HCC and has also attracted more attention in the treatment of HCC with anti-angiogenesis-immune combination therapy. Currently, the synergistic antitumor efficacy of this combination has been shown in many preclinical and clinical studies. In this review, we discuss the mechanism and clinical application of anti-angiogenics and immunotherapy in HCC, outline the relevant mechanism and rationality of the combined application of antiangiogenics and ICIs, and point out the existing challenges of the combination therapy.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01761266, NCT03434379, NCT03713593, NCT03755791, NCT04039607, NCT04770896)",,36405383,L2021770740,10.3748/wjg.v28.i42.6034

Humans suffer from about 200 different types of cancers and many of them have a small number of approved therapeutic agents. Moreover, several types of major cancers are diagnosed at advanced stages as a result of which the existing therapies have limited efficacy against them and contribute to a dismal prognosis. Therefore, it is essential to develop novel potent anticancer agents to counteract cancer-driven lethality. Natural sources such as bacteria, plants, fungi, and marine microorganisms have been serving as an inexhaustible source of anticancer agents. Notably, over 13,000 natural compounds endowed with different pharmacological properties have been isolated from different bacterial sources. In the present article, we have discussed about the importance of natural products, with special emphasis on bacterial metabolites for cancer therapy. Subsequently, we have comprehensively discussed the various sources, mechanisms of action, toxicity issues, and off-target effects of clinically used anticancer drugs (such as actinomycin D, bleomycin, carfilzomib, doxorubicin, ixabepilone, mitomycin C, pentostatin, rapalogs, and romidepsin) that have been derived from different bacteria. Furthermore, we have also discussed some of the major secondary metabolites (antimycins, chartreusin, elsamicins, geldanamycin, monensin, plicamycin, prodigiosin, rebeccamycin, salinomycin, and salinosporamide) that are currently in the clinical trials or which have demonstrated potent anticancer activity in preclinical models.

Pegylated-interferon-α (pegIFNα), the only off-label therapeutic option, has been available for the last 30 years but is associated with suboptimal response rates and poor tolerability. Among the new treatment strategies under clinical evaluation, the entry inhibitor bulevirtide (BLV) is the only one that has received conditional approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA); approval was granted in July 2020 for the treatment of adult patients with compensated CHD at a dose of 2 mg daily. Phase II studies and the week 24 interim analysis of a phase III study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of this treatment as a monotherapy or combined with pegIFNα. This favourable profile has been confirmed by recent real-world studies performed in Europe. As a long-term monotherapy, BLV has been successfully used to treat patients with advanced compensated cirrhosis. These encouraging yet preliminary findings must be viewed with caution as many critical issues related to this new antiviral strategy are still poorly understood, as summarised in this review. While waiting for new anti-HBV and anti-HDV drugs to become available for combination studies, BLV treatment is currently the only available anti-HDV therapeutic option that might improve the long-term prognosis of difficult-to-manage patients with CHD.",,,35752223,L2019631470,10.1016/j.jhep.2022.06.010

NEJM Evid 2022; https://doi.org/10.1056/EVIDoa2100070). Liver function is frequently impaired in patients with HCC, and it is important to evaluate the efficacy and safety of systemic therapies for these patients. Methods: HIMALAYA included patients with Child-Pugh Score class A. This subgroup analysis of HIMALAYA assessed outcomes in patients classified by baseline albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) scores (log10[bilirubin]) x 0.66 - albumin x 0.085), an objective measure based on laboratory values: Grade 1 (score ≤-2.60), Grade 2 (score >-2.60 to ≤-1.39) and Grade 3 (score >-1.39). Due to small sample size, outcomes for the ALBI Grade 3 subgroup (STRIDE, n=1; durvalumab, n=2; sorafenib, n=1) were combined with the ALBI Grade 2 subgroup. Results: Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar across treatment arms. Efficacy outcomes across subgroups are summarised (Table). Safety was consistent with the full analysis set. [Formula presented] Conclusions: STRIDE showed a favourable benefit-risk profile compared with sorafenib across ALBI subgroups.

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2022","2022","33",,"S1465","S1466","1 Nov 2022","Background: In HIMALAYA (NCT03298451), a single priming dose of T plus D (STRIDE) significantly improved overall survival (OS) vs sorafenib (S), and D was noninferior to S in uHCC (Abou-Alfa et al. NEJM Evid 2022; https://doi.org/10.1056/EVIDoa2100070). Viral aetiology is associated with hepatic impairment in HCC development and may influence immunotherapy activity. Thus, we analysed the impact of viral aetiology on clinical outcomes. Methods: This exploratory analysis assessed STRIDE, D and S in patients (pts) with HBV (presence of HBsAg and/or anti-HBcAb with detectable HBV DNA), HCV or nonviral/other (NV) aetiology. OS hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model. As subsets were not sized for formal comparisons, no multiplicity adjustments were made. A post hoc multivariate analysis was used to identify chance imbalances in key prognostic factors that may bias estimated treatment effects. Results: Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar across treatment arms in the HBV and NV subsets. However, in the HCV group, multivariate analysis identified imbalances in two prognostic variables: extrahepatic spread (EHS; more frequent for STRIDE than S) and ALBI (score ≥2 more frequent for STRIDE and D than S). OS and progression-free survival were improved with STRIDE vs S in the HBV and NV groups, but not in the HCV group (Table). Using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model to account for imbalances in EHS and ALBI in the HCV subset, OS HRs favoured STRIDE vs S. OS HRs continued to favour STRIDE when adjusting for EHS and ALBI in the other groups. Results for D vs S showed similar trends to those for STRIDE vs S (Table) [Formula presented]. Conclusions: In HIMALAYA, OS favoured STRIDE vs S (HR <1) for all aetiologies when subsets were adjusted for prognostic factor imbalances in the HCV cohort; similar trends were observed with D vs S across subsets. These results confirm the benefits of STRIDE and D in pts with uHCC, irrespective of underlying aetiology. Clinical trial identification: NCT03298451.

"85P Safety and efficacy of atezolizumab (Atezo) + bevacizumab (Bev) in Japanese patients (pts) with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC): A prospective, multicenter, observational study (ELIXIR) - A preliminary analysis","Ikeda M., Kato N., Kagawa T., Yamashita T., Moriguchi M., Nakamura S., Sawada K., Iijima H., Kamoshida T., Nakao K., Ohkawa K., Sugimoto R., Takehara T., Harada M., Yamamoto Y., Ito T., Kudo M., Kokudo N., Yamamoto K., Furuse J.","Annals of Oncology (2022) 33 Supplement 9 (S1467). Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2022","2022","33",,"S1467",,"1 Nov 2022","Background: Atezo + Bev has been approved as first-line treatment in pts with uHCC based on a global phase 3 study (IMbrave 150). However, there is a lack of real-world data worldwide. Thus, we conducted the ELIXIR study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Atezo + Bev prospectively in 500 real-world Japanese pts. Here, we report the first pre-planned safety assessment in 105 initially registered pts out of 500 pts. Methods: In this prospective, multicenter, observational study, 500 systemic treatment–naïve pts with uHCC and Child-Pugh A received Atezo 1200 mg IV q3w + Bev 15 mg/kg IV q3w. The primary endpoint was adverse events of special interest (AESI). Efficacy outcomes including progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) were assessed in this analysis. Results: A total of 500 pts were enrolled between Apr 2021 and Feb 2022. One hundred and five initially registered pts finished enrollment by Aug 2021 and the median follow-up time was 6.4 mo. A total of 49 AESIs and 35 AESIs Grade ≥3 were observed in these pts (Table). Median PFS was 6.0 mo (95% CI, 5.1, 6.7) per RECIST 1.1 and 6.5 mo (95% CI, 5.2, 8.0) per modified RECIST (mRECIST). ORR was 23.8% (95% CI, 16.0, 33.1) per RECIST 1.1 and 34.3% (95% CI, 25.3, 44.2) per mRECIST. [Formula presented]. Conclusions: In this analysis, additional safety signals were not observed in Japanese pts. Efficacy data could be underestimated at this time. The ELIXIR study showed that Atezo + Bev is a promising first-line treatment for Japanese pts with uHCC in the real world. Clinical trial identification: UMIN000043463.

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2022","2022","33",,"S1454","S1455","1 Nov 2022","Background: TIS is a humanized monoclonal antibody with high affinity and binding specificity to programmed cell death protein 1 receptor. In the phase 3 trial RATIONALE-301 (NCT03412773), TIS showed non-inferior overall survival (OS) vs SOR (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71, 1.02), and was well tolerated in 1L treatment of patients (pts) with unresectable HCC. This analysis assessed and compared efficacy and safety of TIS in the Chinese subgroup with the overall population of RATIONALE-301. Methods: This open-label trial enrolled systemic therapy-naïve adults with histologically confirmed Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage C or B HCC. Pts were randomized (1:1) to receive TIS (200 mg IV every 3 weeks [TIS Arm]) or SOR (400 mg orally twice daily [SOR Arm]) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or treatment discontinuation due to other reasons. The primary endpoint was OS. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), and progression-free survival, all by blinded independent review committee, and safety. Results: Of 674 randomized pts, 425 were from China. In the Chinese subgroup, median follow-up was 13.8 months (mo, 95%CI: 0.1, 50.8) in TIS arm vs 13.1 mo (95%CI: 0.1, 49.4) in SOR arm, similar to the overall population. Efficacy data in the Chinese subgroup were similar to the overall population and characterised by higher ORR and longer DoR in the TIS arm vs the SOR arm (Table). In the Chinese subgroup, 53 pts (24.9%) had grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events in TIS arm vs 112 pts (54.6%) in SOR arm, similar to the overall population (22.2% and 53.4%, respectively) [Formula presented]. Conclusions: TIS demonstrated a numerically longer OS, higher ORR, more durable responses, and a favorable safety profile vs SOR in the Chinese subgroup, consistent with the overall population representing a potential 1L treatment option for Chinese pts with unresectable HCC.

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2022","2022","33",,"S1459","S1460","1 Nov 2022","Background: In an interim analysis of Asian pts with uHCC in the observational REFINE study of regorafenib (NCT03289273), treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were consistent with those reported in the global, phase 3 RESORCE trial. Here, we present the final analysis of Asian pts with uHCC in REFINE. Methods: REFINE is an international, prospective, multicenter study that enrolled pts with uHCC for whom a decision to treat with regorafenib was made by the treating physician prior to enrollment, according to the local health authority approved label. The primary objective is safety, including the incidences of TEAEs and dose modifications due to TEAEs (NCI-CTCAE v4.03). Secondary endpoints include overall survival, progression-free survival, and treatment duration. Results: Of the 1005 evaluable pts, 557 (55%) were from Asia (Korea [31%], Japan [26%], Taiwan [24%], China [18%], Thailand [1%]) and 82% were male. At baseline, median age was 65 years (range 21–94) and the most common HCC etiology in Asian pts was hepatitis B (60%) and in non-Asian pts was alcohol use (36%; Table). More Asian pts (71%) had received prior transarterial chemoembolization vs non-Asian pts (42%). The initial daily regorafenib dose was 160/120/80/40 mg in 51%/12%/35%/3% of Asian pts and 42%/9%/45%/4% of non-Asian pts. The median treatment duration was 3.7 months (range 0–34.4) in Asian pts and 3.6 months (range 0–38.9) in non-Asian pts. The most common TEAEs in Asian pts were hand–foot skin reaction (40%), diarrhea (27%), and decreased appetite (17%). TEAEs led to dose modification in 44% of Asian pts. [Formula presented]. Conclusions: These final data from REFINE confirm the safety and effectiveness of regorafenib in Asian pts with uHCC from a broad population in real-world practice. Final analyses from REFINE are ongoing and will be presented at the conference. Clinical trial identification: NCT03289273.

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2022","2022","33",,"S1456",,"1 Nov 2022","Background: In the global, Phase 3 HIMALAYA study (NCT03298451) in uHCC, a single priming dose of T plus regular interval D (STRIDE) significantly improved overall survival (OS) vs sorafenib (S), and D was noninferior to S (Abou-Alfa et al. NEJM Evid 2022; https://doi.org/10.1056/EVIDoa2100070). HCC aetiology varies globally and may influence response to immunotherapy. HBV is predominant in most Asian countries, whereas HCV or nonviral aetiologies are more common in Japan and Western countries. Thus, we analysed outcomes in patients (pts) enrolled in Asia, excluding Japan. Methods: OS, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR) and safety for STRIDE, D and S were assessed in pts in Asia (Hong Kong, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam; minus Japan). OS hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: The Asia subgroup included 479 pts randomised to STRIDE (n=156), D (n=167) or S (n=156); baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced across treatment arms. In Asia vs globally, 62% vs 31% of pts had HBV (HBsAg and/or anti-HBcAb + HBV DNA), 16% vs 27% had HCV (anti-HCV antibodies) and 22% vs 42% had nonviral aetiology. OS was improved for STRIDE vs S in Asia, consistent with the global population (Table). The OS HR for D vs S in Asia was similar to the global population. In Asia and globally, OS at 36 months, ORR and DoR were higher for STRIDE than for D or S. Outcomes in pts of Chinese descent (Hong Kong/Taiwan) were generally consistent with the full Asian subgroup. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were lower for STRIDE and D vs S in Asia (20% and 13% vs 31%) and globally (26% and 13% vs 37%) [Formula presented]. Conclusions: STRIDE improved outcomes vs S for pts in Asia, consistent with the global population. These results support the benefits of STRIDE for pts with uHCC in the Asia-Pacific region, including Hong Kong and Taiwan. Clinical trial identification: NCT03298451.

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2022","2022","33",,"S1582","S1583","1 Nov 2022","Background: Dacomitinib is a second generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved as first-line therapy in advanced EGFR mutated NSCLC. In the phase 3 ARCHER 1050 trial, PFS and OS were improved with dacomitinib compared to gefitinib. However, patients (pts) with central nervous system (CNS) metastases (mets) were ineligible to enroll into the study. ATORG-003 is an ongoing investigator-initiated single-arm phase 2 trial evaluating a dose titration strategy to improve the safety and tolerability of dacomitinib whilst maintaining efficacy. The intracranial activity of dacomitinib was evaluated in a prespecified subgroup analysis. Methods: ATORG-003 (9 sites, 5 Asian countries) is enrolling newly diagnosed stage IIIB-IV NSCLC pts with EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion [ex19del] or L858R). Pts receive dacomitinib 30 mg orally once daily for one cycle (4 weeks [wks]), after which pts with grade ≤1 toxicity may escalate to 45 mg once daily (investigator/pt decision). A 24 pt subgroup with asymptomatic/controlled CNS mets completed enrollment in Jun2021. CNS mets were assessed by MRI scan at baseline and every 8 wks for 18 months (mo), then every 12 wks with MRI/CT. Key study secondary endpoints include intracranial objective response rate (iORR) and intracranial progression free survival (iPFS). Analyses were based on 7Jun2022 data cutoff date (median 18.7 mo follow-up). Results: Of 24 pts with CNS mets, median age was 65 years (range 33-78), ECOG PS 0/1 in 17%/83% and ex19del/L858R/both in 50%/46%/4%. 8/24 (33%) pts had prior intracranial radiotherapy. 2/24 pts dose escalated to 45 mg once daily after Cycle 1. There was measurable (≥10 mm target lesion) CNS mets in 9/24 (38%) pts. The iORR was 67% (1 intracranial CR [iCR], 5 intracranial PR), and median intracranial duration of response (iDoR) was not reached (NR). In 14 pts with non-measurable CNS mets only, iCR was seen in 6 (43%) pts. Median iPFS was NR with only n=5 CNS progression events in the entire cohort and n=7 remain on treatment. Overall (intra and extracranial) ORR was 67% and PFS rate at 12 mo was 42%. Conclusions: Dacomitinib has significant intracranial activity with observed durable responses in advanced EGFR mutated NSCLC with CNS mets. Clinical trial identification: NCT04027647.

Restrictive EC lead to highly selective patient enrolment, limiting trial opportunities for current patients and compromising the generalizability of previous results in the real-world setting. Methods: A retrospective analysis using electronic medical records in patients with newly diagnosed mCRC in SWSLHD between November 2019 and October 2021 was used to assess the prevalence of potentially eligible patients for first-line clinical trials using standard phase 3 EC and repeated with broadened EC. Results: We identified 138 patients (median age 65; 61.6% male; 48.6% CALD; 21.0% CALD-Preferred Language Not English). 78.3% of patients were offered first-line systemic therapy. 65.7% of patients who received first-line systemic therapy were eligible for clinical trials based on standard EC. None of these patients were offered a clinical trial. Broadening EC to include patients with ECOG PS ≥ 2 and creatinine clearance 45 ml/min increased this to 71.3% and 83.3%, respectively. This increased to 95.3% when EC was broadened to include patients with stable cardiac-comorbidities, prior or stable active malignancy, hepatic dysfunction secondary to metastasis, and treated brain metastases. Conclusions: Total 35% of patients who received first-line systemic therapy for mCRC in this real-world cohort would not have been included in the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of these regimens. This has implications when discussing potential benefitsandriskswithpatients inthereal-worldsettingwhodidnot fit trial EC. Patient eligibility for trials increased from 65.7% to 95.3% when EC was broadened.

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2022","2022","10",,"A617","A618","1 Nov 2022","Background Durvalumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) targeting PD-L1, has demonstrated clinical activity with or without tremelimumab, a CTLA-4 inhibitor, in Phase 3 studies in multiple tumor types.1-3 The occurrence of antidrug antibodies (ADA) could potentially negatively impact ICI safety and efficacy.4 This analysis assessed the immunogenicity of durvalumab using pooled pan-tumor data. Methods Durvalumab immunogenicity was assessed using pooled data from 18 clinical studies of 7826 participants with lung cancer (MYSTIC, ATLANTIC, NEPTUNE, Study 6, ARCTIC, PACIFIC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HIMALAYA, Study 22), bladder cancer (DANUBE, Study 10), head and neck cancer (KESTREL, HAWK, CONDOR, EAGLE, Study 11), gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (Study 21) or advanced solid tumors (Study 1108, Japan Study 2). ADA and neutralizing ADA (nAb) to durvalumab were detected using validated solution-phase bridging electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. Impact of durvalumab ADA on safety was assessed using pan-tumor data from the pool of 18 studies. Impact of ADA on durvalumab pharmacokinetics was assessed using a pooled dataset from Study 1108, PACIFIC, ATLANTIC, CASPIAN, POSEIDON, HIMALAYA, and Study 22. Due to differences in cancer settings of the studies, the impact of durvalumab ADA on efficacy was not assessed. Results The proportion of durvalumab ADA-positive participants at any visit (ADA prevalence) was 6.2% with durvalumab monotherapy (D), 6.8% with T75+D, and 7.3% with T300+D (STRIDE) (table 1). The proportion of treatmentemergent ADA-positive participants (ADA incidence) was low and similar across data pools: 2.7% with D, 3.4% with T75 +D, and 2.8% with T300+D (table 1). Median ADA titers were ≤16 across all ADA categories in all pools (table 1). The proportion of transiently ADA-positive participants out of those with ADA prevalence was 32/191 with D, 22/146 with T75+D, and 3/26 with T300+D. The proportion of participants who tested positive for durvalumab nAb at any visit was 0.5% with D, 0.6% with T75+D, and 1.4% with T300+D (table 1). Incidence of infusion-related reactions was low in ADA-positive participants across treatment regimens (1% with D, and 0% with T75+D and T300+D); there was no marked impact of durvalumab ADA presence on categorical AE data (table 2). Durvalumab ADA presence did not have a clinically meaningful impact on durvalumab exposure metrics. Conclusions Although incidences of ADA vary greatly among ICI 4, analysis of this large, multi-study, pooled pan-tumor dataset demonstrates that durvalumab has a low-risk immunogenicity profile as monotherapy or in combination with tremelimumab. Immunogenicity of durvalumab appeared to have no marked impact on safety or exposure. .",,,,L639737863,10.1136/jitc-2022-SITC2022.0591

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2022","2022","45",,"84",,"1 Nov 2022","Purpose: The present multicenter cohort study aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab and bevacizumab (A+B), the new first line therapy for advanced HCC, in a real-life setting. Methods: We included prospectively collected patients with advanced HCC receiving first-line treatment with A+B at four cancer centers in Germany and Austria between December 2018 and August 2021. Demographics, overall survival (OS) and adverse events were evaluated until September 15th, 2021. Results: In total we included 66 patients. The median age was 66 years and 54 (82%) were male. Predominantly underlying liver disease was alcohol-related liver cirrhosis in 24 patients (36%) and NASH/NAFLD in 18 patients (27%). Most patients had compensated cirrhosis (n=34; 52%), while Child-Pugh class B was observed in 23 patients (35%) and class C cirrhosis in 5 patients (8%). 27 patients (41%) died during follow-up. During a median follow-up period of 211 days from A+B treatment initiation, median OS was not reached. The estimated survival rate was 66% at 6 months and 56% at 12 months. Patients with compensated cirrhosis had an estimated survival rate of 85% at 6 and 78% at 12 months. In 22 patients (33%), the administration of bevacizumab was paused during the course of therapy, mostly due to perceived elevated bleeding risk. 14 patients (21%) developed gastrointestinal bleeding events during A+B treatment. One patient died in association with gastrointestinal bleeding. Discussion: The high bleeding incidence highlights the importance of endoscopic variceal screening before and during A+B therapy. Conclusions: Based on the good efficacy and safety results derived from the phase 3 study (IMBRAVE150), A+B is now considered the new standard of care for advanced, unresectable HCC. Patients in a real-world clinical practice had more advanced liver disease and therefore showed lower survival at 6 and 12 months so far.",,,,L640066454,10.1159/000521004

Thirty-one patients treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab for unresectable HCC and previously treated with MTAs were enrolled in this study. The treatment lines ranged from second to sixth lines. The treatment effect on HCC differed from that during first-line treatment. The treatment effect was determined using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and modified RECIST. The treatment response was different for each MTA immediately prior to atezolizumab + bevacizumab treatment. Tumors treated with lenvatinib followed by atezolizumab + bevacizumab showed rapid growth for a short period of time followed by shrinkage. However, patients who received ramucirumab, sorafenib, and regorafenib did not show such changes. This was likely because of differences in the mechanism of action of the MTA administered immediately beforehand. The side-effect profile differed from that observed in the IMbrave150 phase 3 study of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, which showed more adverse events related to hepatic reserve.

We compared and ranked all relevant transarterial and targeted treatments competing with atezolizumab+bevacizumab for such disease, based on direct and indirect evidence. This network meta-analysis was conducted as a systematic review of phase 2 and 3 randomized sorafenib-controlled trials investigating systemic treatment strategies for HCCs unsuitable for or that progressed after surgery or locoregional treatments as first-line option published between 2008 and 2021. We ranked the treatments based on overall survival (OS) as the primary outcome, together with progression-free survival (PFS) and grade 3–4 adverse events. Subgroup analyses were also implemented to estimate intervention efficacies in particular groups. We identified 3451 publications, 15 trials consisting of 7158 patients, using 14 different therapies including combinations of sorafenib with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), hepatic arterial chemoinfusion, and radioembolization. Regarding OS, atezolizumab+bevacizumab was the only regimen significantly superior to sorafenib (hazard ratio 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25–0.70), and it ranked first. This combination was also the best in the PFS analysis (0.59; 0.47–0.74), followed by lenvatinib (0.66; 0.57–0.76) and TACE+sorafenib (0.73; 0.59–0.91); all had significantly better outcomes than sorafenib alone. TACE+sorafenib (0.52; 0.27–1.00) was ranked first based on OS in a subset with portal invasion, but not in the metastatic series, with atezolizumab+bevacizumab second (0.58; 0.38–0.89). Lenvatinib (odds ratio 1.76; 95% CI 1.35–2.30) and TACE+sorafenib (2.02; 1.23–3.32), but not atezolizumab+bevacizumab (1.38; 0.93–2.05), were significantly less safe than sorafenib monotherapy. Conclusion: Our results indicate that atezolizumab+bevacizumab is the best first-line clinically relevant systemic modality in advanced HCC.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2022","2022","76",,"S1427","S1428","1 Oct 2022","Background: The GALAD score can detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with high accuracy. Despite its high sensitivity, a certain proportion of patients with increased GALAD score do not have HCC. Determining the predictors of false positivity is important for improving the use of GALAD score in routine clinical practice. In this study, we sought to determine the predictors of false-positive GALAD score. Methods: We identified patients with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B infection who had been tested for GALAD score between May 2019-May 2022. The GALAD score is calculated from the following formula: -10.08 + 1.67×(Sex[M = 1, F = 0]) + 0.09×(Age) + 0.04×(AFP-L3%) + 2.34×log(AFP)+1.33×log(DCP). Positivity is defined as a score ≥ -0.63. HCC diagnosis was established by multiphasic cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) or histology. Patients who took Coumadin at the time of blood draw or lacked imaging follow-up were excluded. Demographic and clinical data were obtained at the time the GALAD labs were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine the predictors of false positivity, which was defined as a lack of HCC at the time of GALAD score calculation and during follow-up. Results: A total of 123 patients with positive GALAD score were included. 67.5% were ≥65years of age, 17.9% were female, and 43% were White. 11.4% of the cohort presented with MELD score ≥20. The most common etiology of cirrhosis was NASH/ cryptogenic (30.9%), followed by alcohol (29.3%), and HCV (26.8%). A total of 68 (55.3%) patients had a falsepositive GALAD score. Univariate logistic regression showed a significant association between false positive GALAD scores and male sex (OR 5.64, 95%CI [2.04- 18.28]), MELD score (OR per one unit 1.08, 95% CI [1.02- 1.16]), alcoholic cirrhosis (OR 2.70, 95%CI [1.03- 7.50]) and White race. With White race as a reference group, Asian (OR 0.28, 95%CI [0.09- 0.82]), Hispanic (OR 0.38, 95%CI [0.17- 0.86]), and Black (OR 0.29, 95%CI [0.04- 1.90]) race/ethnicity were associated with a lower incidence of false-positive results. On multivariate logistic regression, male sex and White race were associated with false-positive GALAD score: adjusted OR and 95% CI for male sex (5.55, 1.60- 22.2), for Asian (0.184, 0.04- 0.74) and Hispanic race/ethnicity (0.34, 0.13- 0.88) with White race as a reference group. Conclusion: Male sex and White race are associated with false-positive GALAD score.

J Clin Oncol 2022;40[suppl 4]. Abs 379). Liver function is often impaired in HCC, and it is important to evaluate the efficacy and safety of systemic therapies for these patients. Methods: HIMALAYA included patients with Child-Pugh Score class A. Liver function was evaluated using albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score (log10[bilirubin] x 0.66-albumin x 0.085). Exploratory analyses assessed OS, response, and safety in patients with ALBI grades 1 (score ≤-2.60), 2 (score >- 2.60 to ≤-1.39), or 3 (score >-1.39). OS HRs and 95% CIs were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Due to small sample size of the ALBI grade 3 subgroup (n=4), outcomes were combined with the grade 2 subgroup. Results: Patients randomized to STRIDE, D, and S were classified as ALBI grade 1 (n=217, n=198, and n=203, respectively) or ALBI grade 2/3 (n=175, n=191, and n=186, respectively). Baseline demographics and disease characteristics in the subgroups were similar across treatment arms. In the ALBI grade 1 subgroup, OS HRs (95% CIs) were 0.79 (0.62-1.01) for STRIDE vs S and 0.91 (0.71-1.15) for D vs S. Median OS (95% CI) was 23.43 months (19.19- 28.75) for STRIDE, 21.16 months (17.38-25.86) for D, and 19.02 months (15.67-23.16) for S; 36-month OS rates were 38.0%, 27.0%, and 27.3%, respectively. In the ALBI grade 2/3 subgroup, OS HRs (95% CIs) were 0.83 (0.65-1.05) for STRIDE vs S and 0.87 (0.69-1.09) for D vs S. Median OS (95% CI) was 11.30 months (9.33-14.19) with STRIDE, 12.29 months (9.30-16.03) with D, and 9.72 months (7.23-11.76) with S; 36-month OS rates were 21.8%, 22.5%, and 12.9%, respectively. Objective response rates were numerically higher for STRIDE and D than for S in both ALBI subgroups (Table). Safety in both ALBI subgroups was generally consistent with the full analysis set. Conclusion: STRIDE showed a favorable benefit-risk profile compared with S across ALBI subgroups. STRIDE and D monotherapy may represent new uHCC treatment options for patients with less optimal liver function.

We report an exploratory analysis of EuroQol 5D visual analog scale (EQ-5D VAS) scores in patients with CHD after 48 weeks of treatment with BLV in an ongoing Phase 3 trial. Methods: MYR301 (NCT03852719; EudraCT 2019-001213- 17) is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter trial that assigned 150 CHD patients (1:1:1) to either BLV 2mg or 10mg or control for up to 3 years. Control patients received no BLV treatment until week 48 and switched to BLV 10mg afterwards until 3 years. The EQ-5D VAS is a self-completed rating of the patients' health state (or quality of life) with a range of 0-100 (100 = Best health state). The quality-of- life analysis was based on EQ-5D VAS scores at baseline and week 48. Results: Baseline characteristics were well balanced between BLV 2mg (n=49), BLV 10mg (n=50) and control (n=51) groups. CHD patients treated with BLV 2mg reported statistically significant improvement in quality of life (EQ-5D VAS) at week 48. Also, at week 48, BLV 2mg showed statistically significantly better EQ-5D VAS change from baseline (CFB) scores as compared to control. BLV 10mg EQ-5D VAS scores did not reach the statistical significance levels at week 48 (Table 1). The cirrhosis specific subgroup analysis indicated similar improvement trends among patients with (control vs. BLV 2mg vs BLV 10mg: 5.6 vs. 9.2 vs. 2.6) or without cirrhosis (control vs. BLV 2mg vs BLV 10mg: 3.1 vs. 7.9 vs. 3.9), however, the statistical significance was not reached. Conclusion: Hepatitis D patients treated with BLV 2mg experienced an improvement in quality of life measured by the EQ-5D VAS at week 48. EQ-5D VAS scores improved statistically significantly in BLV 2mg group compared to baseline and in comparison to the control group at week 48 but not in BLV 10mg group. Further investigation is needed to understand the impact of BLV 10mg and the long-term effects of bulevirtide treatment. (Figure Presented).",,,,L639718672,10.1002/hep.32697

Data on the efficacy and safety of SOF/VEL/VOX remained limited to case reports among genetically-diverse, Asian HCV patients, as only 3% of included patients in the existing phase 3 trials were Asians. Data on treatment outcomes of SOF/VEL/VOX as re-treatment following SOF/VEL were limited. We aim to determine the real-world efficacy and safety of SOF/VEL/ VOX among NS5A inhibitor-experienced HCV patients in Asia. Methods: We performed a multicenter, multinational study to include NS5A inhibitor-experienced HCV patients from Asia. Eligible patients were identified from January 2019 to December 2021. Local investigators individually reviewed patients' record and extracted data using a standardized form. Our primary outcome was SVR12. The modified intention-to- treat (mITT) analysis included patients with SVR12 results available, while intention-to- treat (ITT) analysis included all patients treated with SOF/VEL/ VOX. Our secondary outcome was the frequency of adverse events (AEs) up to SVR12. All subjects were treated with SOF/VEL/VOX +/-ribavirin and monitored as per practice guidelines. Results: Total of 25 NS5A inhibitor-experienced HCV patients treated with SOF/VEL/VOX were included from 6 institutions (Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia). The mean age was 55 years with male predominance (84%). More than half had genotype (GT) 3 HCV infection (56%) and liver cirrhosis (64%). The commonest prior DAA regimen was SOF/VEL (80%), and none had resistant testing performed. The overall SVR12 was 95.7% and 88.0% in the mITT and ITT analysis. SVR12 were comparable when subgroup analysis was performed based on HCV genotype (GT3: 91.7% vs 100%, p=0.688). Successful treatment resulted in significant improvement in ALT, AST, AFP, bilirubin, INR and FIB4 score (p<0.05 for all). No patients required treatment cessation due to treatment-related AEs. Two patients demise before treatment completion due to hepatocellular carcinoma and septic shock, which were deemed not related to SOF/VEL/VOX. The only virological failure occurred in patient with GT3 compensated cirrhosis and is currently planned for retreatment following liver transplantation. Conclusion: This is the largest cohort of Asian HCV patients to-date treated with SOF/VEL/VOX to-date, with majority being GT3 with prior SOF/VEL exposure. Our findings suggest SOF/VEL/VOX is an efficacious salvage therapy among NS5A inhibitor-experienced HCV patients in Asia, even without routine resistant testing.",,,,L639718809,10.1002/hep.32697

The primary overall survival endpoint of this study was not met; however, namodenoson was associated with a significant improvement in 12-month overall survival (44% versus 18%, p = 0.028) in the subgroup of patients with CPB score of 7 (CPB7). A phase 3 trial in HCC CPB7 patients is ongoing. Methods: This case report describes a patient who participated in the phase 2 study of namodenoson vs placebo in CPB HCC. Results: A 61-year-old woman with HCC and CPB7 participated in the phase 2 study and had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 at baseline. The patient was in the namodenoson arm and continued treatment with namodenoson for 5years under an open label extension program (treatment is ongoing). Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were elevated at baseline (68 U/L and 44 U/L, respectively), and normalized after 1 treatment cycle, Normal ALT and AST levels were maintained for 5years. The serum α-fetoprotein level was 47 ng/ml at baseline, declined to normal levels after 5 cycles of treatment, and reached 1.3 ng/mL at time of complete response. At baseline, computed tomography (CT) scans demonstrated a large HCC tumor in the context of multifocal disease at baseline. Two treatment cycles later (e.g., after approximately 7weeks) CT demonstrated shrinkage of the tumor mass that was consistent with a partial response. Within 4years of treatment, disappearance of the tumor mass, ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis was observed consistent with a complete response by RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST (Figure). No treatmentemergent adverse events were reported. At the time of reporting this case (5years from treatment initiation), the response is ongoing as indicated by evaluation of liver functions and imaging studies.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2022","2022","76",,"S847","S848","1 Oct 2022","Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease globally and is characterized by steatosis, inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and progressive scarring, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Many promising therapies have reached Phase III clinical trials, but none has met primary histologic endpoints, which are based on pathologist interpretation of thin sections on glass slides. Current 2D histopathological techniques introduce under-sampling error (i.e., a single 5 μm section represents 0.5% of a 1 mm thick biopsy) and interobserver variability. Herein, we present a method for comprehensive assessment of whole liver biopsies to quantify NASH severity. Methods: Human liver biopsies were fixed in formalin, optically cleared using iDISCO, and stained with Collagen I (Novus) or Collagen III (Abcam) antibodies, and Eosin (Leica Biosystems). Regions of biopsies roughly 1 mm3 in volume were imaged with a light-sheet microscope (3Di, Alpenglow Biosciences). Lipid droplets and collagen fibers were segmented across the full 3D datasets using Aivia (Leica Microsystems). CytoMAP and python were used to calculate spatial statistics and classify objects. Results: Liver biopsies were successfully imaged in 3D. The 3D distribution of steatosis and fibrosis varied substantially throughout the volume of the biopsies. To assess steatosis, macrosteatosis objects were categorized into large, intermediate, and small droplet forms (Figure 1A-B). These droplets made up 0.44%, 0.34%, and 0.07% of the total image volume respectively. The combined percentage of the volume ranged from 0% to 5% steatosis across individual optical slices within a 1.7 mm thick biopsy. Fibrosis varied substantially throughout an example biopsy, ranging from 0% to 17%. Conclusion: We rapidly and quantitatively assessed whole liver biopsies providing a comprehensive assessment of NASH severity using our open-top light-sheet microscope and machine learning techniques. This novel method enables us to objectively quantify key features of NASH such as the percentage of fibrosis and steatosis in the entire liver biopsy, preventing under sampling error, and potentially enabling a new scoring system which can correlate closely with clinical disease severity, help enroll patients in clinical trials, and guide treatment and management options. Quantification of additional samples and features of fibrotic liver biopsies is ongoing.",,,,L639720396,10.1002/hep.32697

We report a case of gastric hepatoid adenocarcinoma occurring at the esophagogastric junction; a location scantily reported of this lesion subtype. Case Description/Methods: Our patient presented with abdominal pain, regurgitation, weight loss, and bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy on imaging. Later, two enlarging abdominal wall masses emerged prompting biopsy, staining positive for glypican-3, Hep-Par-1, and alpha-fetoprotein. On endoscopy, an ulcerating mass was noted at the esophagogastric junction extending into the cardia. Next-generation sequencing identified 68th percentile PD-L1 expression. Treatment was initiated with oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and nivolumab. After initial regression, he later succumbed. Discussion: Hepatoid adenocarcinoma accounts for only 0.17-15% of gastric cancer subtypes[1]. Most reports involve lesions occurring solely in the stomach - very few describe occurrences involving the esophagogastric junction supplementing the uniqueness of this case. It also commonly co-occurs with metastatic liver lesions[2] which were not so in this circumstance. These tumors produce alpha-fetoprotein and may also stain positive for novel hepatocellular tumor markers: glypican-3 and Hep-Par-1. In the phase 3 Checkmate 649 trial, the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab combined with chemotherapy was superior to chemotherapy alone[3]. There are currently no evidence-based recommendations for therapy. Current treatment strategies are extrapolated from other gastric cancers lending to a dismal prognosis.",,,,L641286673,10.14309/01.ajg.0000868784.72437.f3

Immunotherapy has obvious advantages in treatment-related toxicity and efficacy compared with traditional therapy. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), immunotherapy alone or in combination with other therapies may help to control tumor progression, and there are many immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) widely used in clinical or ongoing clinical trials. However, tumor immunology research is still facing many challenges. How to effectively evaluate the efficacy, whether there are related biomarkers, the generation of immune tolerance and the lack of clinical trials to objectively evaluate the efficacy are still urgent problems to be solved, but it also brings new research opportunities for basic and clinical immunology researchers.

However, only a minority of patients experience durable clinical benefit with immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy in most disease settings. Spurred by preclinical and correlative studies to understand mechanisms of non-response to the PD-(L)1 antagonists and by combination studies in animal tumor models, many drug development programs were designed to combine anti-PD-(L)1 with a variety of approved and investigational chemotherapies, tumor-targeted therapies, antiangiogenic therapies, and other immunotherapies. Several immunotherapy combinations improved survival outcomes in a variety of indications including melanoma, lung, kidney, and liver cancer, among others. This immunotherapy renaissance, however, has led to many combinations being advanced to late-stage development without definitive predictive biomarkers, limited phase I and phase II data, or clinical trial designs that are not optimized for demonstrating the unique attributes of immune-related antitumor activity-for example, landmark progression-free survival and overall survival. The decision to activate a study at an individual site is investigator-driven, and generalized frameworks to evaluate the potential for phase III trials in immuno-oncology to yield positive data, particularly to increase the number of curative responses or otherwise advance the field have thus far been lacking. To assist in evaluating the potential value to patients and the immunotherapy field of phase III trials, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) has developed a checklist for investigators, described in this manuscript. Although the checklist focuses on anti-PD-(L)1-based combinations, it may be applied to any regimen in which immune modulation is an important component of the antitumor effect.",,,36175037,L2020565619,10.1136/jitc-2022-005413

This post hoc analysis compared efficacy and safety in patients with lower and higher bodyweights. Methods: This comparison included patients from Study 202 (Japanese, n = 43; Korean, n = 3) and Japanese patients from REFLECT (n = 81) who received lenvatinib. In Study 202, all patients received a starting dose of lenvatinib 12 mg/day; in REFLECT, patients received starting doses based on bodyweight (patients <60 kg, 8 mg/day; ≥60 kg, 12 mg/day). Safety and efficacy were assessed in both studies according to bodyweight. Results: In Study 202, treatment-related, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) led to dose reductions in 80.8% and 55.0% of patients in the lower and higher bodyweight groups, respectively. In REFLECT, treatment-related TEAEs led to dose reductions in 52.5% and 70.7% of patients in the 8 and 12 mg groups, respectively. In Study 202, median overall survival (OS) was 16.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.8–25.1) and 21.3 months (95% CI, 10.1–not estimable) in the lower and higher bodyweight groups, respectively.

We aimed to evaluate the effects of odevixibat, an ileal bile acid transporter inhibitor, versus placebo in children with PFIC. Methods: Patients eligible for this 24-week, randomised, double-blind, completed, phase 3 study were paediatric outpatients diagnosed with PFIC1 or PFIC2 who had pruritus and elevated serum bile acids at screening. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using an interactive web-based system to once a day oral placebo, odevixibat 40 μg/kg, or odevixibat 120 μg/kg. Randomisation was done in a block size of six and stratified by PFIC type and patient age; patients, clinicians, and study staff were blinded to treatment allocation. Patients were enrolled at one of 33 global sites. Two primary endpoints were evaluated: proportion of positive pruritus assessments (PPAs; ie, scratching score of ≤1 or ≥1-point decrease as assessed by caregivers using the Albireo observer-reported outcome [ObsRO] PRUCISION instrument) over 24 weeks, and proportion of patients with serum bile acid response (ie, serum bile acids reduced by ≥70% from baseline or concentrations of ≤70 μmol/L) at week 24. Efficacy and safety were analysed in randomly allocated patients who received one or more doses of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03566238. Findings: Between June 21, 2018, and Feb 10, 2020, 62 patients (median age 3·2 [range 0·5−15·9] years) were randomly allocated to placebo (n=20), odevixibat 40 μg/kg per day (n=23), or odevixibat 120 μg/kg per day (n=19). Model-adjusted (least squares) mean proportion of PPAs was significantly higher with odevixibat versus placebo (55% [SE 8] in the combined odevixibat group [58% in the 40 μg/kg per day group and 52% in the 120 μg/kg per day group] vs 30% [SE 9] in the placebo group; model-adjusted mean difference 25·0% [95% CI 8·5−41·5]; p=0·0038). The percentage of patients with serum bile acid response was also significantly higher with odevixibat versus placebo (14 [33%] of 42 patients in the combined odevixibat group [10 in the 40 μg/kg per day group and four in the 120 μg/kg per day group] vs none of 20 in the placebo group; adjusting for stratification factor [PFIC type], the proportion difference was 30·7% [95% CI 12·6−48·8; p=0·0030]). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were diarrhoea or frequent bowel movements (13 [31%] of 42 for odevixibat vs two [10%] of 20 for placebo) and fever (12 [29%] of 42 vs five [25%] of 20); serious TEAEs occurred in three (7%) of 42 odevixibat-treated patients and in five (25%) of 20 placebo-treated patients. Interpretation: In children with PFIC, odevixibat effectively reduced pruritus and serum bile acids versus placebo and was generally well tolerated. Odevixibat, administered as once a day oral capsules, is a non-surgical, pharmacological option to interrupt the enterohepatic circulation in patients with PFIC.

To assess time trends in QoL inclusion among endpoints and reporting of QoL results in publications, we reviewed phase III oncology trials published in major journals in 2017-2021, compared to the previous 5 years. Methods: All issues published between 2017 and 2021 by 11 major journals were hand-searched for primary publications of phase III trials in adult patients with solid tumors. Information about endpoints was derived from paper, study protocol and ClinicalTrials.gov, when available. Secondary QoL publications were searched in PubMed. Results were compared with trials published in 2012-2016 included in the previous analysis. Results: 388 publications between 2017 and 2021 were eligible and compared with 446 publications between 2012 and 2016. QoL was included among endpoints in 68.0% of the trials published in 2017-2021 vs 52.9% in 2012-2016 (p<0.001). Considering the advanced/metastatic setting, QoL was included in 75.8% of trials in 2017-2021 vs. 59.9% in 2012-2016 (p<0.001). Out of 264 primary publications of trials published in 2017-2021 with QoL among endpoints, QoL results were available in 51.9%, vs 62.3% in 2012-2016 (p=0.02). Overall, QoL was included among endpoints and presented in primary publications in 35.3% of trials in 2017-2021 vs 33.0% in 2012-2016 (p=0.83). In the advanced/metastatic setting, QoL was included and presented in 39.4% of publications in 2017-2021 vs. 37.9% in 2012-2016 (p=0.77). For trials without QoL results in the primary publication, probability of secondary publication was 10.8%, 29.0% and 42.4% at 1, 2 and 3 years respectively. Conclusions: While the proportion of oncology trials including QoL among endpoints significantly increased in the last 5 years compared to 2012-2016, a significantly lower proportion of trials reported QoL results in primary publications. QoL is still subject to remarkable underreporting and delay in publication. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors. Funding: Has not received any funding. Disclosure: L.

This study aimed to assess C (Camrelizumab; anti-PD-1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody) + R (Rivoceranib, Apatinib; VEGFR2-TKI) vs. S (Sorafenib) as first-line treatment for uHCC. Methods: In this international, randomized, open-label, phase III trial, eligible patients (pts) were randomized 1:1 to receive C (200 mg, iv, q2w) + R (250 mg, po, qd) or S (400 mg, po, bid). Pts were stratified by macrovascular invasion and/or extrahepatic metastases, geographical region (Asia vs. non-Asia), and baseline serum AFP (<400 vs. ≥ 400 ng/mL). The primary endpoints were PFS per RECIST v1.1 criteria by BIRC as well as OS. The primary analysis for PFS was done after 339 PFS events occurred (May 10, 2021) and the planned interim analysis of OS was done after 262 deaths occurred (Feb 8, 2022). Results: A total of 543 pts (ITT population) were randomized to receive C+R (N=272) or S (N=271) respectively. With a median follow-up time of 7.8 mo, PFS was significantly improved with C+R vs. S (median 5.6 mo [95% CI 5.5-6.3] vs. 3.7 mo [2.8-3.7]; HR 0.52 [95% CI 0.41-0.65]); 1-sided p<0.0001). With a median follow-up of 14.5 mo, OS was significantly prolonged with C+R vs. S (median 22.1 mo [95% CI 19.1-27.2] vs. 15.2 mo [13.0-18.5]; HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.49-0.80]; 1-sided p<0.0001). ORR, DCR and DoR were also better with C+R vs. S (Table). A pre-specified subgroup analysis showed that HRs of PFS and OS obviously favored C+R in the majority of the subgroups. Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 80.9% with C+R and 52.4% with S. TRAE led to discontinuation of any treatment in 24.3% (of both agents in 3.7%) with C+R and 4.5% with S. Fatal TRAE occurred in 1 pt in each arm. [Formula presented] Conclusions: C+R significantly prolonged PFS and OS and improved ORR vs. S, and presents as a new first-line treatment option for uHCC.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2022","2022","33",,"S869","S870","1 Sep 2022","Background: In HIMALAYA (NCT03298451), a single, high priming dose of T plus D (STRIDE) significantly improved overall survival (OS) vs sorafenib (S), and D was noninferior to S in uHCC (Abou-Alfa et al. J Clin Oncol 2022;40(suppl 4). Abs 379). Viral aetiology is associated with hepatic impairment in HCC development, and may influence immunotherapy activity. Thus, we analysed the impact of viral aetiology on clinical outcomes. Methods: This exploratory analysis assessed STRIDE, D and S in patients (pts) with HBV (presence of HBsAg and/or anti-HBcAb with detectable HBV DNA), HCV or nonviral/other (NV) aetiology. OS hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model. As subsets were not sized for formal comparisons, no multiplicity adjustments were made. A post hoc multivariate analysis was used to identify chance imbalances in key prognostic factors that may bias estimated treatment effects. Results: Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar across treatment arms in the HBV and NV subsets. However, in the HCV group, multivariate analysis identified imbalances in two prognostic variables: extrahepatic spread (EHS; more frequent for STRIDE than S) and ALBI (score ≥2 more frequent for STRIDE and D than S). OS and progression-free survival were improved with STRIDE vs S in the HBV and NV groups, but not in the HCV group (Table). Using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model to account for imbalances in EHS and ALBI in the HCV subset, OS HRs favoured STRIDE vs S. OS HRs continued to favour STRIDE when adjusting for EHS and ALBI in the other groups. Results for D vs S showed similar trends to those for STRIDE vs S (Table). [Formula presented] Conclusions: In HIMALAYA, OS favoured STRIDE vs S (HR <1) for all aetiologies when subsets were adjusted for prognostic factor imbalances in the HCV cohort; similar trends were observed with D vs S across subsets. These results confirm the benefits of STRIDE and D in pts with uHCC, irrespective of underlying aetiology. Clinical trial identification: NCT03298451.

"727TiP A randomised phase III study of tremelimumab (T) plus durvalumab (D) with or without lenvatinib combined with concurrent transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) versus TACE alone in patients (pts) with locoregional hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): EMERALD-3","Abou-Alfa G.K., Fan J., Heo J., Arai Y., Erinjeri J.P., Kuhl C.K., Lencioni R., Ren Z., Zeng A., Evans B., Cohen G., Kudo M.","Annals of Oncology (2022) 33 Supplement 7 (S874). Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2022","2022","33",,"S874",,"1 Sep 2022","Background: Locoregional therapies such as TACE are the most common treatments for pts with intermediate-stage HCC. Although TACE results in tumour responses, progression and recurrence are common, and median overall survival (OS) is approximately 20 months. TACE may alter the tumour microenvironment and serve as a primer for immunotherapies. The STRIDE regimen of Single Tremelimumab (high, priming 300-mg dose) Regular Interval Durvalumab (1500 mg every 4 weeks) improved OS vs sorafenib in pts with unresectable HCC (Abou-Alfa et al. J Clin Oncol 2022;40(suppl 4). Abs 379). Lenvatinib improved survival outcomes vs TACE in patients with unresectable HCC in a proof of concept study (Kudo et al. Cancers [Basel] 2019;11:1804). EMERALD-3 (NCT05301842) is a phase III, randomised, open-label, sponsor-blind, multicentre study assessing the efficacy and safety of STRIDE, with or without lenvatinib, given concurrently with TACE (either drug-eluting bead TACE or conventional TACE) vs TACE alone in pts with intermediate-stage HCC not amenable to curative therapy. Trial design: 525 pts will be randomised 1:1:1 to Arm A (STRIDE plus lenvatinib [8 mg or 12 mg] once daily plus TACE), Arm B (STRIDE plus TACE), or Arm C (TACE alone). In Arm A and Arm B, the first TACE procedure will occur no earlier than 7 days following T and the first dose of D (and lenvatinib in Arm A); in Arm C the first TACE procedure will occur within 7 days post-randomisation. Eligible pts must have confirmed HCC (by imaging or histopathology) not amenable to curative therapy but eligible for embolisation, Child-Pugh score class A, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1, measurable disease by modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (mRECIST) and adequate organ and marrow function. Pts with visible baseline major portal vein invasion (Vp3/Vp4) or uncontrolled hypertension are excluded. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) for Arm A vs Arm C by blinded independent review using RECIST v1.1. Additional endpoints include PFS for Arm B vs Arm C, OS, health-related quality of life and safety. Clinical trial identification: NCT05301842.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2022","2022","33",,"S1401",,"1 Sep 2022","Background: The global, randomized, double-blind, Ph3 LEAP-002 study (NCT03713593) evaluated the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib + pembrolizumab (lenva + pembro) vs lenvatinib (lenva) + placebo as 1L therapy for aHCC. Methods: Eligible pts with aHCC were randomized 1:1 to lenva (8 mg/day if BW<60 kg or 12 mg/day if BW≥60 kg) plus pembro (200 mg IV Q3W) or lenva plus placebo. Dual primary endpoints OS and PFS (per RECIST 1.1 by BICR) were assessed using the stratified log-rank test. ORR (per RECIST 1.1 by BICR) was a key secondary endpoint. The protocol specified 2 interim analyses (IAs) and a final analysis (FA) for OS. Prespecified efficacy boundaries were one-sided P = 0.002 for PFS at IA1 (prespecified final PFS analysis) and 0.0185 for OS at FA. Results: 794 pts were randomized (lenva + pembro, 395; lenva, 399). At FA (data cutoff 21 June 2022; median follow-up 32.1 mo), 534 OS events had occurred and 36 pts (9.1%) in the lenva + pembro arm and 24 pts (6.1%) in the lenva arm remained on study treatment. The median OS with lenva + pembro was 21.2 mo vs 19.0 mo with lenva, and the HR was 0.840 (95% CI: 0.708-0.997, P=0.0227, Table). HR for PFS at IA1 (data cutoff 5 April 2021) was 0.867 (95% CI: 0.734-1.024, P=0.0466, Table). ORR at FA was 26.1% for lenva + pembro vs 17.5% for lenva. Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were 62.5% in the lenva + pembro arm and 57.5% in the lenva arm (grade 5 TRAEs, 1.0% vs 0.8%). Post-study systemic anti-cancer treatments were used in 44.1% vs 52.1% of pts, in each arm, respectively. [Formula presented] Conclusions: LEAP-002 primary endpoints of OS (at FA) and PFS (at IA1) did not meet pre-specified statistical significance. The combination of lenva + pembro achieved the longest median OS ever reported in 1L HCC Ph3 studies (21.2 mo) with no new safety signals observed. The median OS of 19.0 mo with lenva monotherapy supports its role as a standard of care in 1L aHCC. Clinical trial identification: NCT03713593.

This phase III, multicenter, randomized, open-label study evaluates the efficacy of GC followed by EBV-CTL versus GC alone as first-line treatment for locally recurrent but incurable and metastatic NPC (R/M). EBV-CTL is an autologous T-cell immunotherapy generated from blood of the patient and manufactured without genetic modification. Thirty clinical trial sites involved were from USA, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand. Methods: Patients with R/M NPC were randomized to Arm A (GC x 4 cycles and EBV-CTL x up to 6 cycles) or Arm B (GC x 6 cycles) in a 1:1 ratio. Primary Objective is to assess Overall Survival (OS) of EBV-CTL following GC compared to GC. Results: Of 330 randomized patients, 164 were enrolled in Arm A and 166 in Arm B. 325 patients were treated including 133 patients treated with EBV-CTL. The central Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facility was able to produce sufficient EBV-CTL for 94% of Arm A patients. Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced. Median age was 54 (21-80) years, 75.2% were male, 97% were Asian, 43.6% had an ECOG PS of 1. 65.2% of Arm A and 66.3% in Arm B had prior radiation/chemoRT for earlier locoregional NPC. Patients who completed 4 cycles of GC were 82.3 % in Arm A, and 82.5 % in Arm B (58.4% completed 6 cycles). 80.5% of patients in Arm A received at least two infusions of EBV-CTL. Median dose per cycle was 4.5 × 10(8) cells/m(2). The median OS was 25.0 months (19.7-31.8) in Arm A and 24.9 months (19.7-32.8) in Arm B (hazard ratio [HR] 1.19; p = 0.1942). Secondary endpoints of PFS and ORR will be available at time of ESMO Congress 2022. 87.7% of patients had grade 3 or higher adverse events (AE) (85.0% in Arm A, 89.6% in Arm B). Thirteen out of 133 patients treated with EBV-CTL (9.8%) experienced EBV-CTL related AEs, all grade 1 and 2, except two grade 3 events of anemia and leukopenia that occurred in one patient. Conclusions: EBV-CTL as first-line treatment in patients with R/M NPC had a favorable safety profile but did not demonstrate a longer OS vs standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2022","2022","33",,"S1402","S1403","1 Sep 2022","Background: Tislelizumab (TIS), an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated durable responses and was well tolerated as monotherapy in 2L+ treatment in patients (pts) previously treated systemically for unresectable HCC (Ducreux et al, 2021). TIS has been further evaluated against sorafenib (SOR) in a global randomized Phase 3 study (RATIONALE-301; NCT03412773) as 1L treatment in adult pts with unresectable HCC. Methods: Systemic therapy-naïve adults with histologically confirmed HCC BCLC Stage B/C who were not amenable to or progressed after loco-regional therapy, Child-Pugh A, with ≥1 measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1, and an ECOG PS ≤1 were eligible. Pts were randomized 1:1 to receive TIS (200 mg IV Q3W) or SOR (400 mg PO BID) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal, or no longer benefiting from therapy. The primary endpoint was OS; secondary endpoints included ORR, PFS, and DOR by blinded independent review committee, and safety. Non-inferiority of OS between TIS and SOR was tested against the non-inferiority margin of 1.08. Results: A total of 674 pts were randomized (n=342, TIS; n=332, SOR); at data cutoff (11 Jul 2022) minimum study follow up was 33 months (mo). In this final analysis, RATIONALE-301 met its primary endpoint of OS non-inferiority (mOS: 15.9 mo [TIS] vs 14.1 mo [SOR]; stratified HR: 0.85 [95.003% CI: 0.712, 1.019]). TIS was associated with higher ORR (14.3% vs 5.4%) and more durable responses (mDoR: 36.1 mo vs 11.0 mo) compared with SOR. Median PFS with TIS was 2.2 mo and 3.6 mo with SOR (HR: 1.1 [95% CI: 0.92, 1.33]). Median treatment duration was longer with TIS vs SOR (4.1 mo vs 2.7 mo). The safety profiles for both treatments were consistent with prior reports. Incidence rates of grade ≥3 AEs (48.2% vs 65.4%) and AEs leading to discontinuation (10.9% vs 18.5%) were lower with TIS compared with SOR; AEs leading to death were low across both treatments (4.4%, TIS; 5.2%, SOR). Immune-mediated AEs occurring in ≥5% TIS-treated pts were hepatitis (5.3%) and hypothyroidism (5.3%). Conclusions: Single-agent TIS demonstrated clinically meaningful OS benefit that was non-inferior to SOR with a favorable safety profile as a 1L treatment option for pts with unresectable HCC.

"Prognostic and predictive biomarkers for cabozantinib in HCC","Rimassa L.","Clinical Cancer Research (2022) 28:17 Supplement. Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2022","2022","28","17",,,"1 Sep 2022","In recent years, the therapeutic landscape for patients with advanced/unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become more complex, novel immunotherapy combinations have demonstrated their activity and represent a new standard of care, such as atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, or will soon be included in the treatment algorithm, such as durvalumab plus tremelimumab. For other combinations such as cabozantinib plus atezolizumab, a progression-free survival (PFS) benefit not associated with an improvement in overall survival (OS) was shown. However, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including cabozantinib, still remain important therapeutic options in the management of patients with advanced HCC. In this field there is a lack of prognostic and predictive biomarkers and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) remains the most widely used prognostic biomarker in clinical practice and the only predictive biomarker available only for ramucirumab. Cabozantinib inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases implicated in HCC progression, tumor immunosuppression, and resistance to antiangiogenic therapy, including VEGF receptors 1-3, MET, and the TAM family kinases TYRO3, AXL, and MER. Cabozantinib significantly improved OS and PFS compared to placebo in patients with previously treated advanced HCC in the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial. In the presented exploratory analyses, outcomes were evaluated according to baseline plasma biomarker levels and changes during treatment at week 4 or 8. Biomarkers chosen for the study included AFP, cabozantinib targets and their ligands, and other plasma proteins with prognostic significance in HCC. OS and PFS were analyzed by baseline levels as dichotomized or continuous variables and by on-treatment changes at week 4 or 8 as continuous variables; multivariable analyses adjusted for clinical covariates were also performed. Finally, outcomes were also evaluated based on clinical factors as ALBI grade and adverse events. Several biomarkers or clinical factors at baseline or during treatment were identified as prognostic and associated with different OS and/or PFS. Low baseline levels of AFP, MET, HGF, GAS6, IL-8, ANG2, high levels of IGF-1, and ALBI grade 1 were identified as potential favorable prognostic biomarkers/factors in previously treated advanced HCC. However, hazard ratios for OS and PFS favored cabozantinib over placebo at low and high baseline levels for all biomarkers, and no baseline biomarkers predicted treatment benefit. Cabozantinib induced pharmacodynamic changes in several biomarkers, but these changes were not associated with OS or PFS, except for AFP response which correlated with improved OS and PFS. The occurrence of some adverse events during treatment has been associated with longer OS and PFS with cabozantinib.

"Trial Design and Endpoint Definition in intermediate-stage HCC - a Challenge","Galle P.R.","Clinical Cancer Research (2022) 28:17 Supplement. Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2022","2022","28","17",,,"1 Sep 2022","Trial Design and Endpoint Definition in general is more complex in hepatocellular carcinoma compared to other solid tumors. It took decades of research until the first systemic treatment was defined in 2007 as a result of the SHARP and the ASIA-Pacific trials. The demonstration of Sorafenib's anti-tumor efficacy in advanced HCC to a large extend was owing to the concentration on patients with good liver function, avoiding the confounding impact of liver cirrhosis. In intermediate stage HCC trial design is even more challenging: intermediate stage HCC is a heterogeneous disease with a broad spectrum of tumor burden, variable liver function, and radiological intervention with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as a standard procedure which is far beyond standardization. Several trials have been launched either combining TACE with systemic therapy or comparing TACE vs. systemic therapy. Several issues in this setting are questioning overall survival as preferred endpoint: with an expected survival in excess of 2.5 years and several systemic therapies available, the competing risks of death (liver disease) and the contribution of post-trial treatments are increasingly impacting OS and obscuring the effectiveness of the trial-specific intervention. This is exemplified by the TACTICS trial, comparing TACE + Sorafenib with TACE, where a solid PFS benefit for the combination (HR: 0.661) did not translate into OS (HR: 0.861), possibly because of a more than 20% higher rate of post-treatment medication in the TACE-only group. Thus, there is an obvious need for surrogate markers, indicative of increased survival time but shifting overall survival analysis into secondary endpoints. We recently started the ABC-HCC trial, a phase IIIb, randomized, multicenter, open-label trial of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we are using a pragmatic and real-life endpoint, Time to failure of treatment strategy (TTFS) as primary endpoint. TTFS is defined as Time from randomization until failure of strategy, i.e. radiologic progression or lack of radiologic response AND any of the following: the loss of clinical benefit OR unacceptable toxicity OR liver function deterioration OR therapy not further applicable for other reasons Secondary endpoints comprise OS, Overall Survival Rate at 24 months (OS@24), Objective Response Rate (ORR), Time to Progression (TTP), Time to loss of systemic treatment options (TTSYS), Progression free survival (PFS), Duration of Treatment, Duration of Response (DOR), Time to deterioration of liver function, Safety, and QoL (Patient Reported Outcome; PRO). The trial includes an exploratory biomarker analysis. The ABC-HCC and other trials will give us information on the role of systemic therapy in intermediate stage HCC in the upcoming years.",,,,L639179453,10.1158/1557-3265.LIVERCA22-IA15

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2022","2022","28","17",,,"1 Sep 2022","Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) are the most frequently mutated metabolic genes across human cancers including cholangiocarcinoma. These hotspot gain-of-function mutations will lead to the IDH enzyme to aberrantly produce high levels of R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2- HG), which is thought to be the oncometabolite. 2-HG can competitively inhibit enzymes that regulate epigenetics, DNA repair, metabolism, and it can also modulate tumor immune microenvironment. IDH-1 mutations are particularly common in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), and their frequency varies depending on the geographic location and underlying etiology. Many inhibitors targeting mutant IDH (mIDH) are under active clinical development. Results from the phase III ClarIDHy trial have demonstrated that ivosidenib-a first-in-class, oral, small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH1, was well tolerated and could improve progression-free survival and a favorable overall survival benefit versus placebo, leading to the regulatory approval of ivosidenib in mIDH1 cholangiocarcinoma.

Robust data has shown that 5FU-based, second-line, combination chemotherapy has modest activity in a molecularly-unselected population. An improved understanding of the biology underpinning iCCA has led to the identification of molecular alterations linked to targeted therapies. The most prominent alterations are mutations in IDH1 and FGFR2 fusions; both of these are addressed later in the session. This presentation will highlight other selected subgroups, including patients whose tumours are harbouring BRAF-V600E mutations, HER2 amplification/over-expression, and NTRK fusions as examples, although additional groups continue to emerge. Cholangiocarcinoma is recognised to have an underlying immune predisposition, in selected cases. Harnessing the immune response has previously provided limited signals of efficacy.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2022","2022","45",,"293",,"1 Sep 2022","Introduction: An assembly of inflammatory cells may be found in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of gastrointestinal malignancies. Some of the cells in the TME mediate protumoral activities. An important component of the infiltratory cells is the enzyme thymidine phophorylase (TP) which is localised in endothelial cells, macrophages, fibroblasts (1), and cells of monocyte origin such as Kupffer cells. The inhibition of TP positive cells results in a prolongation of the survival time. Methods: We searched the literature for reports on the efficacy of the blockade of TP positive cells in the entities of gastrointestinal malignancies. A direct inhibition of TP may be achieved by tipiracil, which is a component of the drug Lonsurf R. An alternative method for the removal of TP positive cells is the local generation of 5-FU resulting in the apoptosis of the exposed cells (2). This effect may be accomplished by the action of capecitabine, whose 5-FU generating capacity is dependent on the presence of TP. Results: The efficacy of the modulation of the activity of TP expressing cells following temporary tumor stabilaisation was demonstrated in phase 2 and phase 3 studies and in various singular cases following continuous application of antiangiogenic therapy. An improved survival as compared to the controls and attributable to the blockade of TP positive cells was demonstrated by the action of capecitabine in esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (3), and in hepatocellular carcinoma (4), and by the action of Lonsurf R in colorectal cancer (5), and in gastric cancer (6). Capecitabine was shown to be as active as the antibody ramucirumab to modify the activity of endothelial cells in patients with gastric cancer as demonstrated in the Rainfall trial (7). Conclusions: The view on cells in the TME will help to appreciate the role of bystander cells in the course of a malignancy. The results of the blockade of TP emphasises the significance of TP positive cells as additional drivers of the tumor progression and may help to improve strategies to delay the course of a malignant disease. The analysis of other factors such as radiation or cytokines inducing the expression of TP may help to appreciate the steps supporting the progression of a tumor. The described mechanisms may be transferred to other tumor entities.",,,,L640261926,10.1159/000526456

In the pivotal phase 3 CELESTIAL trial a significant improvement for OS and PFS was shown for cabozantinib in comparison to placebo treated patients (Abou-Alfa GK et al. N Engl J Med 2018; 379:54- 63). However, in 62% of patients a dose reduction of cabozantinib was necessary and the median average daily dose was 35.8 mg. The discontinuation rate due to treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) was 16%. For HCC patients treated with sorafenib in first-line, a reduced starting dose of 200 mg BID was not inferior in terms of OS but showed a trend toward a decreased rate of sorafenib discontinuation (Reiss KA et al. J Clin Oncol 2017; 35:3575-3581). The aim of the CaboRISE trial is to study the effect of a reduced starting dose of cabozantinib on tolerability, safety, and efficacy. Methods: The CaboRISE trial is an open-label, single arm, multicenter phase II trial, including patients with advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A only, if liver cirrhosis is present) in second line treatment. Forty evaluable patients will be enrolled in the study to receive a reduced starting dose of 40 mg cabozantinib once-daily for 4 weeks and subsequent dose escalation to 60 mg cabozantinib once-daily to be maintained until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. Primary endpoint is the treatment discontinuation rate due to TRAEs. The objective of the trial is to assess the tolerability of a reduced starting dose of cabozantinib, in order to reduce the treatment discontinuation rates due to treatment-related adverse events below 10%. Secondary endpoints are overall survival, progression free survival at 10 weeks, objective response rate, time on treatment, treatment exposure, toxicity, and quality of life. Study start of the CaboRISE trial was in October 2020. By April 2022, 10 centers across Germany have been initiated and a total of 10 out of 40 planned patients have been enrolled.

It was not until 2017 that several breakthroughs were made in the development of systemic strategies. Lenvatinib, another multikinase inhibitor, stood out successfully after sorafenib, and has been applied to clinical use in the first-line setting. Other multikinase inhibitors such as regorafenib, ramucirumab and cabozantinib, were approved in quick succession as second-line therapies. Concurrently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have readily become established treatments for many solid tumors, including HCC. The most studied ICIs to date, target programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), its ligand PD-L1, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). These ICIs have demonstrated efficacy in treating advanced HCC. More recently, combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab (ICI targeting PD-L1) was approved as the gold-standard first-line therapy.

Methods: COSMIC-312 is an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial that enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma not amenable to curative or locoregional therapy and previously untreated with systemic anticancer therapy at 178 centres in 32 countries. Patients with fibrolamellar carcinoma, sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma, or combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma were not eligible. Tumours involving major blood vessels, including the main portal vein, were permitted. Patients were required to have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, adequate organ and marrow function, and Child-Pugh class A. Previous resection, tumour ablation, radiotherapy, or arterial chemotherapy was allowed if more than 28 days before randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1:1) via a web-based interactive response system to cabozantinib 40 mg orally once daily plus atezolizumab 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily, or single-agent cabozantinib 60 mg orally once daily.

Median follow-up was 15·8 months (IQR 14·5–17·2) in the progression-free survival ITT population and 13·3 months (10·5–16·0) in the ITT population. Median progression-free survival was 6·8 months (99% CI 5·6–8·3) in the combination treatment group versus 4·2 months (2·8–7·0) in the sorafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·63, 99% CI 0·44–0·91, p=0·0012). Median overall survival (interim analysis) was 15·4 months (96% CI 13·7–17·7) in the combination treatment group versus 15·5 months (12·1–not estimable) in the sorafenib group (HR 0·90, 96% CI 0·69–1·18; p=0·44).

Summary: After controversial results of monotherapy, ICPIs have been mainly investigated in association with antiangiogenic agents or as dual checkpoint inhibition. The combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab has become the new therapeutic standard for unresectable HCC. Currently, a number of ICPI-based combinations are being studied in phase III clinical trials as front-line therapy for advanced HCC, with growing interest in integration of early-stage disease management in the form of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapies. With most of the trials investigating ICPIs as first-line treatment, the second-line scenario relies mainly on tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which however have not been formally trialed after ICPIs.

After a decade in which only sorafenib was available for advanced and metastatic HCC, the emergence of other molecularly targeted drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has significantly improved the patients` prognosis. In particular, the use of ICIs has shown promising results and has revolutionized the treatment algorithm in HCC patients. Indeed, preclinical and clinical data have documented a high density of immunosuppressive cells and an increased expression of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and cytotoxic T-cell associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) in HCC. However, despite these observations, no validated biomarker is available and the molecular groundwork responsible for response to ICIs remains elusive. The anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody tremelimumab and the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumab were the first ICIs to be tested in HCC. Recently, the combination of the anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor atezolizumab and the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab demonstrated an improvement in patient outcome compared to sorafenib, becoming the standard of care in the frontline setting of advanced disease. Other immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab or the combination nivolumab-ipilimumab have shown promising results that have to be confirmed in phase III studies. Currently, the combination of different ICIs (i.e., ipilimumab, durvalumab) and anti-angiogenic agents (i.e., regorafenib, lenvatinib) is currently being tested in several trials and will hopefully revolutionize the treatment of HCC. To date, numerous studies are underway evaluating ICIs in adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings to improve survival in early and intermediate stages. Thus, this review focuses on the rationale for ICIs and their potential use for early or intermediate HCC stages.",,,,L2018301490,10.3390/cancers14143332

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2022","2022","25","7","S395",,"1 Jul 2022","Objectives: Resmetirom is an oral, liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor beta (THR-β) selective agonist in Phase III development for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with significant fibrosis (NASH). An economic evaluation was conducted to assess the cost-effectiveness of resmetirom in the US setting. Methods: A Markov model was developed consisting of two sub-models of NASH, with and without cardiovascular (CV) history. In each sub-model, patients transitioned among no-fibrosis (F0) and fibrosis (F1-F3) stages, compensated cirrhosis (or F4), decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, post-liver transplant, and death. Data from a published randomized clinical trial of resmetirom versus placebo were used to populate the model. The transition from the first to second sub-model was driven by the first occurrence of a nonfatal CV event in NASH patients, estimated based on pooled baseline patient characteristics. The model captured worsening and improvement in the patients’ fibrosis stages (F0-F3) based on changes in liver fat, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). Model outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), cirrhosis/F4 and liver transplant cases avoided, and costs. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA/PSA) were performed, with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY applied. Results: An incremental 1.392 QALYs were gained in the resmetirom arm, with an incremental cost of $107,705 compared to no-treatment. The incremental cost/QALY gained for resmetirom versus no-treatment was $77,348. The cirrhosis/F4 and liver transplant risks were reduced by 32.48% and 33.82%, leading to cost savings of $47,880 (-39.98%) and $32,372 (-40.50%) in the resmetirom arm, respectively. The most impactful input parameter was the proportion of patients achieving fibrosis improvement in both arms, according to DSA. The PSA showed that resmetirom was cost-effective, with a probability of 70%. Conclusions: Model results showed that managing NASH with resmetirom would be cost-effective in the US; reducing or preventing end-stage liver events and associated costs.",,,,L2018955706,10.1016/j.jval.2022.04.558

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2022","2022","77",,"S658",,"1 Jul 2022","Background and aims: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Most cases (90%) of HCC arise in the setting of a chronic liver disease. The advanced stages of HCC are amendable only to systemic treatment. Systemic therapy has been revolutionized by immune-based therapies. However, a recent metaanalysis of three randomized phase III clinical trials that tested inhibitors of PD-L1 or PD1 in more than 1, 600 patients with advanced HCC, revealed that immune therapy did not improve survival in patients with non-viral HCC. The aim of the study was to identify differences in immune cell population of patients with HCC, according to etiopathogenesis of cirrhosis, in order to identify different patterns that may be targeted for immunotherapy. Method: We analyzed 50 leukocyte sub-populations, using flow cytometric technique, in a cohort of 111 consecutive HCC cirrhotic patients with different etiopathogenesis. Differences between groups were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: We divided HCC patients with cirrhosis into five groups according to etiology of liver disease: alcoholic, viral (HCV/HBV), metabolic (NAFLD/NASH), overlap between etiological factors and other etiology. Leukocyte sub-populations were significantly different in two groups. Specifically in the group of alcoholic etiology there were increased levels of PMN (p < 0.01), monocytes (p < 0.01) and NKT cells CD57+RA- (4-8-) (p = 0.011), while in viral etiology group therewere increased levels of T cells CD57-RA+ (4-8-) (p = 0.007) and T cell CD3+ (4-8-) (p = 0.009). No specific leukocyte subpopulation was significantly increased in the other groups, in particular in the metabolic one. Conclusion: These data suggest that in liver disease with different etiopathogenesis there are different immunological microenvironments. Innate and innate-like cells are the principal regulators of immune response in alcoholic HCC, while adaptive immune system is predominant in viral etiology. This suggests that differences in cancer-mediated immune escape could explain the different response to immunotherapy and may be helpful in identification of responder patients to new HCC therapy.",,,,L2019089628,10.1016/S0168-8278(22)01633-6

Compared with HBV monoinfection, patients with CHD have a greater risk of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplant, and liver-related mortality. In 2020, the European Medicines Agency granted conditional marketing authorisation to bulevirtide (BLV) 2 mg, a novel NTCP entry inhibitor, as the first treatment approved for CHD. We report an exploratory analysis of health-related quality-oflife outcomes in patients with CHD after 48 weeks of treatment with BLV 2 mg in an ongoing Phase 3 trial. Method: MYR301 (NCT03852719; EudraCT 2019-001213-17) is a randomised, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre trial that assigned 150 CHD patients (1:1:1) to 3 exploratory arms (BLV 2 or 10 mg or control) for up to 3 years. (As BLV 10 mg is not an approved dosage, we do not report that treatment arm.) Control patients received no active anti-HDV treatment until Week (W)48. Patients completed the Hepatitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (HQLQ), including the SF-36 and 15 supplemental items, at study baseline (BL), W24, and W48. Higher scores on the HQLQ (range 0–100) indicate better health. Interim results collected at W24were reported previously.(1) Results: BL characteristicswerewell balanced between BLV 2 mg (n = 49) and controls (n = 51). For BLV 2 mg, mean age was 44 years, BMI was 24 kg/m(2), 61% were male, 83% were White, and 47% had compensated cirrhosis. Across groups, patients reported varying scores of HQLQ. From BL to W48, BLV 2 mg was associated with improvements in all HQLQ domains; notably, >5-point improvements in mean values were observed for 10 of the 14 items (Figure). Treatment differences vs controls in least-squares mean changes from BL to W48 were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for rolephysical, hepatitis-specific (HS) limitations, and HS health distress. Improvements with BLV 2 mg seen at W24 were largely maintained or increased at W48. (Figure Presented) Conclusion: CHD patients treated with BLV 2 mg showed an improvement at W48 in all domains of the HQLQ, while patients in the control group remained largely unchanged, apart from substantial improvements in health distress and HS health distress.

The nanoscale formulation of chemotherapeutic drugs often referred to as cancer nanomedicines (CNs), assists in delivering and targeting the pharmaceutical, therapeutic, and diagnostic agents to cancer and other targeted cells. Consequently, NF of combined chemotherapeutic drugs improves the DDS by increasing the circulation time and bioavailability.

Recently, it was also reported that the phase III trial of durvalumab+tremelimumab achieved the primary endpoint, and this combination therapy will also be available in clinical practice. In the development of new regimen for HCC, immune checkpoint inhibitors have become the main focus. For advanced-stage HCC, development of combination regimens containing a VEGF inhibitor and immune checkpoint inhibitor (e.g., lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, etc.) or combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., ipilimumab plus nivolumab, etc.) as first-line treatment is under way. For Intermediate-stage HCC, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is established as the standard treatment, but recent systemic therapy have been reported to be higher objective response rate, around 30-50%, which was comparable to those of TACE. In 2015, the criteria of “TACE refractory” was presented as a good indication for systemic therapy. Then, in Apple Consensus Meeting 2019, the concept of “TACE unsuitable” has been proposed. The indications for systemic therapy has been expanded to the intermediate stage, which is a good indication for TACE. Recently, various developments of systemic therapy, such as the combination therapy of TACE and new promising regimens are underway in patients with intermediate stage HCC. For early-stage HCC, combination immunotherapy is being attempted as adjuvant therapy after resection and radiofrequency ablation and as neoadjuvant treatment prior to surgical resection.

Although the strict evidence is for second line treatment after sorafenib, ramucirumab has been used in patients who have been pretreated with a variety of systemic therapies in clinical practice since it approved. In this study, we retrospectively examined the treatment outcomes of ramucirumab in patients that administrated after diverse treatments. Materials and Methods: We corrected data on patients who received ramucirumab in patients with advanced HCC at three institutions in Japan. Radiological assessments were determined according to RECIST version 1.1 and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 was used for the assessment of adverse events.

The present study aims to assess the degree of HCC incidence reduction in those under the BSV treatment. Materials and Methods: The present study is a part of an extensional phase 3 trial for BSV. A total of 190 CHB patients were treated with BSV up to 288 weeks. We assessed the incidence of HCC during the follow-up and compared it with predictive numbers of HCC cases using the models developed in untreated CHB patients (REACH-B and GAG). In addition, we compared the performance of HCC prediction models developed in CHB patients receiving antiviral therapy. Results: During the follow-up of 288 weeks, 7 patients developed HCC; 1 of 139 non-cirrhotic patients and 6 of 51 liver cirrhosis patients. We compared the HCC incidence with the prediction number of the REACH-B model in non-cirrhotic patients at 288 weeks. The standard incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated to be 0.128 (P = 0.039), which suggests a significant decrease of HCC incidence in non-cirrhotic patients. The incidence of HCC in the cirrhosis patient was compared using the GAG model, and the SIR was 0.392 (P = 0.026), suggesting decreased HCC incidence in liver cirrhosis patients. By multivariable analysis, liver cirrhosis (P = 0.006) and age (P = 0.002) were the significant factors for the development of HCC. When we compared the HCC prediction models developed in CHB patients under antiviral therapy, the HCC-RESCUE model showed higher AUROC (0.913) than PAGE (0.749), mPAGE (0.779), THRI (0.826), CAMD (0.911), or AASL (0.920) without statistical significance.

Materials and Methods: Of the 16,181 cases of all cancers registered during the 9-year period from 2007 to 2015, 516 cases of liver cancer were included in the analysis. All cases were classified by UICC (Union for International Cancer Control) stage according to tumor factors at the time of carcinogenesis. 214 cases of UICC Stage I, 126 cases of Stage II, 110 cases of Stage III, and 66 cases of Stage IV were registered. The cancer registration period was divided into three periods: Period I, 2007-2009 (167 cases); Period II, 2010-2012 (209 cases); and Period III, 2013-2015 (140 cases), and the overall survival of each stage was compared. Results: The Median Survival Time (MST) for UICC Stage I (IA + IB) was 75.6 months for Period I, 45.6 months for Period II, and 57.6 months for Period III. The MST for Stage II was 42.0 months for Period I, 22.8 months for Period II, and 27.6 months for Period III. The MST of Stage IV was 2.4 months in Period I, 1.8 months in Period II, and 4.8 months in Period III.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of regorafenib and the predictors of treatment outcomes in Taiwanese patients. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the survival, best overall response, predictors of treatment outcomes, and safety for uHCC patients who had tumor progression on sorafenib therapy and received regorafenib as salvage therapy between March 2018 and November 2020. Results: Eighty-six patients with uHCC were enrolled (median age, 66.5 years; 76.7% male). The median regorafenib treatment duration was 4.0 months (95% confidence intervals [CI], 3.6-4.6). The most frequently reported adverse events were hand-foot skin reaction (44.2%), diarrhea (36.0%), and fatigue (29.1%). No unpredictable toxicity was observed during treatment. The median overall survival (OS) with regorafenib was 12.4 months (95% CI, 7.8-17.0), and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.7-4.7). Of 82 patients with regorafenib responses assessable, 4 patients (4.9%) achieved a partial response, and 33 (40.2%) had stable disease, leading to a disease control rate (DCR) of 45.1% (n = 37). Patients possessing baseline AFP<400 ng/mL exhibited a markedly longer median OS, median PFS, and higher DCR compared with their counterparts (15.7 vs. 8.1 months, 4.6 vs. 3.7 months, 60.9% vs. 27.5%, respectively). Despite possessing high baseline AFP levels, patients with early AFP response ([10% reduction at 4 weeks or[20% reduction at 8 weeks after regorafenib administration) exhibited comparable treatment outcomes to those with baseline AFP<400 ng/mL. Conclusion: The results of this real-world study verified the tolerability and efficacy of regorafenib treatment for uHCC patients who failed prior sorafenib therapy, especially for those with lower baseline AFP levels or with early AFP response.",,,,L638738359,10.1007/s12072-022-10337-4

Date of Publication: 16 Jun 2022","2022","12",,,,"16 Jun 2022","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an important cause of cancer death and is considered the 3rd most lethal around the world. Hepatectomy, liver transplantation, and ablation therapy are considered curative treatments for early-stage HCC. Transarterial chemoembolization is the preferred therapy for intermediate stage HCC. Ssystemic therapy is recommended for advanced HCC. For more than a decade, sorafenib and lenvatinib were used as the first-line treatment for the advanced HCC. For the great success of immunotherapy in melanoma and lung cancer, some immune-based treatments, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have been applied in the treatment of HCC. The anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) antibodies, including nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for sorafenib-pretreated patients. Moreover, due to the results of durable antitumor responses attained from the phase 3 trials, atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab is now the standard therapy for advanced HCC. Recently, there are a lot of clinical trials involving the ICIs, as monotherapy or combination therapy, with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antiangiogenic drugs, cytotoxic agents, and locoregional treatments, providing a promising outcome for advanced HCC. Thus, this review summarized the role of ICIs for HCC patients with monotherapy or combination therapy. The success and failures of monotherapy and combination therapy involving ICIs have provided advanced insights into HCC treatment and led to novel avenues to improve therapy efficacy in HCC.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01008358, NCT01658878, NCT01693562, NCT02576509, NCT02702401, NCT02702414, NCT02989922)",,,L2018075849,10.3389/fonc.2022.898964

Methods: M13-576, a rollover study, evaluated the durability of SVR in a follow-up period of approximately 3 years after hepatitis C virus genotype 1–6-infected participants received a glecaprevir- and/or pibrentasvir-containing regimen in previous phase 2/3 clinical trials. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of participants maintaining SVR and the percentage of participants experiencing relapse or reinfections. Resistance-associated substitutions and safety outcomes related to liver progression were also assessed. Results: Of 384 participants enroled, 377 participants were included in the as-observed population and 287 participants completed the study. In prior studies, 99.7% (376/377) of participants achieved SVR12; of those, an observed 99.5% (374/376) and 100% (286/286) completing the study, maintained SVR. After non-responder imputation of missing data, 286/376 participants (76%) maintained SVR. The participant previously not achieving SVR was a treatment-experienced male with compensated cirrhosis who had NS3 and NS5A substitutions at enrolment, which remained detectable for 12 months. Of the two participants not maintaining SVR, one was re-infected and one experienced late relapse at post-treatment week 60. Five participants (all with a fibrosis stage ≥F3) had hepatocellular carcinoma. No events were deemed related to glecaprevir/pibrentasvir. Conclusions: Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir demonstrated long-term durability of efficacy after SVR12 was achieved. Hepatic-related decompensation events were not seen.

HCC comprises nearly 90% of all cases of primary liver cancer. Approximately half of all patients with HCC receive systemic therapy during their disease course, particularly in the advanced stages of disease. Immuno-oncology has been paradigm shifting for the treatment of human cancers, with strong and durable antitumor activity in a subset of patients across a variety of malignancies including HCC. Immune checkpoint inhibition with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, an antivascular endothelial growth factor neutralizing antibody, has become first-line therapy for patients with advanced HCC. Beyond immune checkpoint inhibition, immunotherapeutic strategies such as oncolytic viroimmunotherapy and adoptive T-cell transfer are currently under investigation. The tumor immune microenvironment of HCC has significant immunosuppressive elements that may affect response to immunotherapy. Major unmet challenges include defining the role of immunotherapy in earlier stages of HCC, evaluating combinatorial strategies that use targeting of the immune microenvironment plus immune checkpoint inhibition, and identifying treatment strategies for patients who do not respond to the currently available immunotherapies.

We aimed to identify prognostic and predictive factors of response to ramucirumab in patients with aHCC with AFP ≥400 ng/mL from the phase III REACH and REACH-2 randomized trials. Patients and Methods: Patients with aHCC, Child-Pugh class A with prior sorafenib treatment were randomized in REACH and REACH-2 (ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo, biweekly). Meta-analysis of individual patient-level data (pooled population) from REACH (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) and REACH-2 was performed. A drug exposure analysis was conducted for those with evaluable pharmacokinetic data. To identify potential prognostic factors for overall survival (OS), multivariate analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. To define predictors of ramucirumab benefit, subgroup-by-treatment interaction terms were evaluated. Results: Of 542 patients (316 ramucirumab, 226 placebo) analyzed, eight variables had independent prognostic value associated with poor outcome (geographical region, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score ≥1, AFP >1,000 ng/mL, Child-Pugh >A5, extrahepatic spread, high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, high alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase).

While no baseline factor was predictive of a differential OS benefit with ramucirumab, analyses demonstrated an association between high drug exposure, treatment-emergent hypertension (grade ≥3), and increased ramucirumab benefit.

This analysis examined the number of prior lines of systemic therapy and clinical outcomes associated with tislelizumab. Methods: Patients who received ≥ 1 prior line of systemic therapy for advanced HCC, excluding immune checkpoint inhibitors, received tislelizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was objective response rate by independent review committee (IRC) (ORR IRC ) per RECIST version 1.1. Secondary endpoints included investigator-assessed (INV) ORR INV, duration of response by IRC (DoR IRC ), DoR by INV (DoR INV ), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival by IRC (PFS IRC ), and safety. Results: As of June 2021, 249 patients were enrolled; 138 had received 1 prior line of therapy and 111 patients had received ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2022","2022","33",,"S308",,"1 Jun 2022","Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the world's sixth most prevalent cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. For patients with advanced HCC, trials combining TACE with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as Sorafenib have given mixed outcomes. (TACE) plus lenvatinib led showed significant improvement in OS compared to lenvatinib alone in the first-line setting in patients with advanced HCC according to phase 3 LAUNCH trial which was presented at the 2022 ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. This study was aimed to compare the outcome of HCC patients who received TACE plus TKI agent versus TACE alone. Methods: The subjects with unresectable HCC were included in this study retrospectively, who underwent liver transplantation (LT) and were treated by either TACE alone (TA) or TACE plus Sorafenib (TandS) between July 2008 – December 2021. For categorical factors, HCC recurrence after LT was reported as frequencies and proportions, while for continuous variables, the median and interquartile range (IQR) or mean was used. For categorical variables, Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used, while for continuous variables, Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Results: The total of seven hundred patients were screened; only 128 patients in total underwent LT with most being males (77%) with a median age of 61.5 years. The TA group included 79 (77%) subjects who matched Milan Criteria (MC) and 24 (23%) who did not, but the TandS group had a greater number of cases who did not meet MC: 16 (64%) versus 9 (36%); p=0.01. There was a significant variation in five-year disease-free survival (DFS) across the therapy groups investigated, with 100% DFS in the TandS group vs 67.2 percent in the TAne group (p=0.07). The TandS group had a five-year patient survival rate of 77.8% compared to 61.5 percent in the TA group (p=0.51). However, beyond the MC, patients who were treated with TA had the average percentage of necrotic tumor on resected histology of 43.8 %, 32 % compared to 69.6 %, 32.8 % for cases treated with TandS, p=0.03. Conclusions: We have found that using TandS is generally well tolerated and demonstrated improved OS compared to TA in patients with unresectable HCC.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2022","2022","33",,"S255",,"1 Jun 2022","Background: Tislelizumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 monoclonal antibody, demonstrated clinical activity and was well tolerated in patients with previously treated advanced HCC in the phase 2 RATIONALE-208 study (NCT03419897). Here, we report results for the Chinese subpopulation. Methods: Eligible patients who had received ≥ 1 prior line of systemic therapy for advanced HCC, excluding immune checkpoint inhibitors, received tislelizumab 200 mg intravenously once every three weeks. The primary endpoint was objective response rate by independent review committee (IRC) (ORR IRC ) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Secondary endpoints included ORR by investigator (INV) (ORR INV ), duration of response by IRC (DoR IRC ), DoR by INV (DoR INV ), overall survival (OS), PFS by INV (PFS INV ), PFS by IRC (PFS IRC ), and safety. Results: As of June 2021, 249 patients were enrolled, and the Chinese subpopulation comprised 122 patients; baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between the Chinese and overall (N=249) populations. Median follow-up duration was 12.9 months for the Chinese subgroup and 12.7 months for the overall population. Response rates were not impacted by region: ORR IRC was 12.3% (95% CI: 7.1, 19.5) and ORR INV was 13.9% [95% CI: 8.3, 21.4) in the Chinese subpopulation, and ORR IRC was 12.9% (95% CI: 9.0, 17.7) and ORR INV was 14.5% (95% CI: 10.3, 19.5) in the overall population. Median DoR IRC in both populations was not reached. Median DoR INV was consistent between the Chinese (21.4 months [95% CI: 7.6, NE]) and overall (21.4 months [95% CI: 11.1, NE) populations. Median PFS IRC was 1.4 months (95% CI: 1.4, 2.6) and median PFS INV was 1.5 months (95% CI: 1.4, 2.7) for the Chinese subpopulation, while median PFS IRC was 2.7 months (95% CI: 1.4, 2.8) and median PFS INV was 2.8 months (95% CI: 2.6, 4.0) for the overall population. Median OS was 13.7 months (95% CI: 9.9, 17.0) vs 13.2 months (95% CI: 10.8, 15.2) for the Chinese vs overall population, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were similar between the Chinese and overall populations; 18.9% vs 15.5% of patients experienced ≥ Grade 3 TRAEs, and 4.9% vs 5.2% experienced TRAEs that led to treatment discontinuation in the Chinese vs overall population, respectively. The most common ≥ Grade 3 TRAEs were increased aspartate aminotransferase (4.1% vs 2.8%) and increased alanine aminotransferase (1.6% vs 1.2%) for the Chinese vs overall population, respectively. Conclusions: Tislelizumab is clinically active and well tolerated in Chinese patients with previously treated advanced HCC, and the results are consistent with the overall study population. An ongoing phase 3 clinical trial will continue to investigate the impact of region on the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab monotherapy (NCT03412773). Clinical trial identification: NCT03419897.

COSMIC-021 (NCT03170960), a multinational phase 1b study, is evaluating cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in various solid tumors. Efficacy and safety results in previously untreated aHCC (cohort 14) and previously treated GEJ/GC (cohort 15) are presented. Methods: Patients had measurable disease and ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Patients with aHCC, Child-Pugh A status, and no prior systemic anticancer therapy were eligible for cohort 14. Patients with GC, GEJ, or lower one-third esophageal adenocarcinoma who radiographically progressed during or following platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy and had ≤2 prior lines of therapy were eligible for cohort 15. Patients received cabozantinib 40 mg PO QD and atezolizumab 1200 mg IV Q3W. CT/MRI scans were performed Q6W for 52W and Q12W thereafter. The primary endpoint was ORR by investigator per RECIST 1.1. Other endpoints included safety, PFS, and OS. Results: As of the data cutoff of 21 Dec 2021, 30 patients with aHCC and 31 with GEJ/GC (22 with GEJ, 8 with GC, and 1 other) were enrolled with a median (range) follow-up of 31.2 mo (23.0, 34.2) and 30.4 mo (19.5, 33.6), respectively. For aHCC, median age was 71 y, 12 (40%) had ECOG PS 0; disease etiology was 6 (20%) HBV, 11 (37%) HCV, and 13 (43%) non-viral. Extrahepatic invasion was present/absent in 13 (43%)/16 (53%), macrovascular invasion in 2 (7%)/20 (67%), and portal vein invasion in 10 (33%)/13 (43%). For GEJ/GC, median age was 61 y, 11 (35%) had ECOG PS 0, and 16 (52%), 14 (45%), and 1 (3%) received 1, 2, or 3 prior lines of systemic therapy. ORR per RECIST 1.1 was 13% (all confirmed PRs) for aHCC and 0 for GEJ/GC. Median DOR was 22.1 mo for aHCC. DCR (CR + PR + SD) was 83% for aHCC and 48% for GEJ/GC. Median PFS per RECIST 1.1 was 5.7 mo in aHCC and 2.4 mo in for GEJ/GC; median OS was 19.0 mo and 6.4 mo, respectively. Frequent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) for aHCC and GEJ/GC were PPE (47% and 13%), diarrhea (37% and 26%), AST increased (33% and 13%), and fatigue (23% both). Grade 3/4 TRAEs occurred in 40% for aHCC and 35% for GEJ/GC. No grade 5 TRAEs occurred in either cohort. Conclusions: Cabozantinib plus atezolizumab had clinical activity with a manageable safety profile in previously untreated aHCC, consistent with the recently presented phase 3 results in this indication (NCT03755791).

"O-5 Outcomes by baseline liver function in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with tremelimumab and durvalumab in the phase 3 HIMALAYA study","Vogel A., Chan S., Furuse J., Tak W., Masi G., Varela M., Kim J., Tanasanvimon S., Reig M., Dayyani F., Makowsky M., Marcovitz M., Negro A., Abou-Alfa G.","Annals of Oncology (2022) 33 Supplement 4 (S380-S381). Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2022","2022","33",,"S380","S381","1 Jun 2022","Background: In the phase 3 HIMALAYA study (NCT03298451) in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), a single, high priming dose of tremelimumab (anti-CTLA-4) plus durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) in the STRIDE regimen significantly improved overall survival (OS) vs sorafenib, and durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib (Abou-Alfa et al. J Clin Oncol 2022;40[suppl 4]. Abs 379). Liver function is frequently impaired in patients with HCC, and it is important to evaluate the efficacy and safety of systemic therapies for these patients. Methods: HIMALAYA included patients with Child-Pugh Score class A. Baseline liver function was evaluated using albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score (log10[bilirubin] x 0.66−albumin x 0.085), an objective measure based on laboratory values. Exploratory analyses assessed OS, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), time-to-response (TTR), and safety in patients classified into ALBI grade 1 (score ≤-2.60), ALBI grade 2 (score >-2.60 to ≤-1.39), and ALBI grade 3 (score >-1.39) subgroups. OS hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for treatment, etiology, ECOG performance status, and macrovascular invasion. Due to small sample size, outcomes for the ALBI grade 3 subgroup (STRIDE, n=1; durvalumab, n=2; sorafenib, n=1) were combined with the ALBI grade 2 subgroup. Results: Patients randomized to STRIDE, durvalumab, and sorafenib were classified as ALBI grade 1 (n=217, n=198, and n=203, respectively) or ALBI grade 2/3 (n=175, n=191, and n=186, respectively). Baseline demographics and disease characteristics in the subgroups were similar across treatment arms. In patients with ALBI grade 1, OS HRs (95% CIs) were 0.79 (0.62-1.01) for STRIDE vs sorafenib, consistent with the full analysis set (0.78 [96% CI, 0.65-0.93]), and 0.91 (0.71-1.15) for durvalumab vs sorafenib, numerically higher than the full analysis set (0.86 [96% CI, 0.73-1.03]). Median OS (95% CI) was 23.43 months (19.19-28.75) with STRIDE, 21.16 months (17.38-25.86) with durvalumab, and 19.02 months (15.67-23.16) with sorafenib; 36-month OS rates were 38.0%, 27.0%, and 27.3%, respectively. ORRs were 21.7% for STRIDE, 18.7% for durvalumab, and 7.4% for sorafenib. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) DoR was 22.34 months (8.71-Not reached [NR]), 23.26 months (7.43-NR), and 22.06 months (6.51-25.99), respectively; median TTR (IQR) was 2.07 months (1.84-3.94), 1.91 months (1.81-3.98), and 3.52 months (1.84-5.49), respectively. In patients with ALBI grade 2/3, OS HRs (95% CIs) were 0.83 (0.65-1.05) for STRIDE vs sorafenib and 0.87 (0.69-1.09) for durvalumab vs sorafenib. Median OS (95% CI) was 11.30 months (9.33-14.19) with STRIDE, 12.29 months (9.30-16.03) with durvalumab, and 9.72 months (7.23-11.76) with sorafenib; 36-month OS rates were 21.8%, 22.5%, and 12.9%, respectively. ORRs were 18.3% for STRIDE, 15.2% for durvalumab, and 2.7% for sorafenib. Median (IQR) DoR was 26.55 months (7.43-NR), 13.83 months (7.43-27.43), and 12.25 months (7.69-NR), respectively; median TTR (IQR) was 3.52 months (1.91-5.40), 3.65 months (1.94-3.94), and 9.10 months (7.79-11.01), respectively. Safety in the ALBI subgroups was generally consistent with the full analysis set. Conclusions: STRIDE showed a favorable benefit-risk profile compared with sorafenib across ALBI subgroups. STRIDE and durvalumab may represent new treatment options in uHCC for patients with less optimal liver function. Clinical trial identification: NCT03298451.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2022","2022","33",,"S362","S363","1 Jun 2022","Background: The phase III IMbrave150 trial led to the approval of immunotherapy with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as a new first-line standard of care for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent evidence suggests that patients with non-viral etiology might be less responsive to immunotherapy. Therefore, we performed a large multicenter analysis of patients with non-viral advanced HCC, treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, lenvatinib or sorafenib. Methods: We performed an analysis of prospectively collected retrospectively analysed data from patients with non-viral advanced HCC, treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, lenvatinib or sorafenib, in 36 centers in 4 countries (Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, and United Kingdom). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus lenvatinib. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus lenvatinib, and OS and PFS with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sorafenib. For the primary and secondary endpoints, we performed the analysis firstly on the whole population, then we divided the cohort into two groups NASH/NAFLD and non-NASH/NAFLD population. Results: 190 patients received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, 569 patients received lenvatinib, and 210 patients received sorafenib. In the whole population Univariate unweighted Cox regression model showed a 29% reduction in the risk of death for patients on lenvatinib (HR 0.71 95%CI: 0.50-1.06; p = 0.1028) and a 36% reduction in the risk of progression for patients on lenvatinib (HR 0.64; 95%CI: 0.49-0.84; p = 0.0017) for patients on lenvatinib, compared with patients on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. In NASH-NAFLD population univariate unweighted Cox regression model showed a 54% reduction in the risk of death risk (HR 0.46; 95%CI: 0.25-0.88; p = 0.0181), and a 48% reduction in the risk of progression for patients on lenvatinib (HR 0.52; 95%CI: 0.34-0.80; p = 0.0028) for patients on lenvatinib compared with patients on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. In non- NASH-NAFLD population univariate unweighted Cox regression model showed a 4% reduction in the risk of death (HR 0.96; 95%CI: 0.60-1.54; p = 0.8862) and a 25% reduction in the risk of progression for patients on lenvatinib compared with patients on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (HR 0.75; 95%CI 0.52-1.08; p = 0.1300) for patients on lenvatinib, compared with patients on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. All these results were confirmed following propensity score matching analysis. By comparing patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sorafenib, no statistically significant difference in survival was observed. Conclusions: The present analysis conducted on a large number of advanced non-viral HCC patients showed for the first time a significant survival benefit with lenvatinib compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, in particular in patients with NASH/NAFLD-related HCC.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2022","2022","3","2","90","98","1 Jun 2022","In the past years, treatment options for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have thriven. Although globally recognised, the patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are often underused and quality of life (QoL) results are underreported in many phase III trials. We performed a systematic review to describe the prevalence of QoL inclusion and heterogeneity in QoL reporting in published phase III trials of systemic treatment in advanced HCC. Twenty-one publications were identified: 12 (57.1%) in first line setting, eight (38.1%) in second line and only one (4.7%) in second and further lines.

The hazard ratio ([HR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]) for OS was 0.781 (0.611-0.998) in KEYNOTE-240 and 0.79 (0.63-0.99) in KEYNOTE-394; HR (95% CI) for PFS was 0.78 (0.61-0.99) and 0.74 (0.60-0.92), respectively. ORR differences with pembro vs pbo were similar in KEYNOTE-240 (13.8% [95% CI, 7.7-19.5]) and KEYNOTE-394 (11.4% [95% CI, 6.7-16.0]). We performed a prespecified metaanalysis of KEYNOTE-240 and KEYNOTE-394 to obtain a more precise estimate of the pembro treatment effect. Methods: In KEYNOTE-240 and KEYNOTE-394, pts with confirmed aHCC and progression or intolerance to sorafenib or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (KEYNOTE-394 only) were randomized 2:1 to pembro (200 mg IV Q3W) or pbo for ≤35 cycles, both with best supportive care. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were similar. Meta-analysis of pt data pooled from the ITT population of the pembro and pbo arms of each study was completed. OS, PFS (blinded independent central review [BICR] per RECIST 1.1), and ORR (BICR per RECIST 1.1) were assessed. Results: In total, 578 pts who received pembro and 288 who received pbo were included. The HR for OS and PFS and the difference in ORR for pembro vs pbo in all pts was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67- 0.93), 0.76 (0.64-0.89), and 12.5 (8.8-16.2), respectively (Table).

TIS, an anti-PD-1 antibody, was clinically active and well tolerated in pts with previously treated advanced HCC in the Phase 2 RATIONALE-208 study (NCT03419897). Objective response rate by independent committee review (IRC) in pts with a history of HBV infection was consistent with the overall population (12.5% vs 13.3%, respectively). We explored whether TIS treatment was associated with increased HBV DNA and the clinical significance of HBV DNA elevations. Methods: Pts with ≥ 1 prior systemic therapy for advanced HCC received TIS 200 mg IV Q3W. Pts with inactive, chronic, or active HBV were eligible if HBV DNA levels were < 500 IU/mL at screening (pts with detectable hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] or detectable HBV DNA were required to be managed per treatment guidelines). HBV DNA testing was conducted every 4 cycles if HBV DNA was detectable at screening, or when clinically indicated. Results: Among 249 enrolled pts, 128 had a history of HBV infection. Of these pts, 114 were HBsAg positive at baseline (BL), 36 had detectable HBV DNA at BL, and 32 had detectable HBV DNA and HBsAg at BL. Clinically significant increases in HBV DNA levels from BL were reported in 7 pts, with no pattern relative to the time of TIS initiation (Table). All 7 pts were HBsAg positive at BL and had been receiving antiviral treatment for ≥ 3 months before the first dose of TIS. Six out of the 7 pts had increases in alanine transaminase (ALT) from BL during the study (Table), 4 of whom had ≥ 3-fold increases in ALT which were observed concurrently or soon after HBV DNA increases. IRC-assessed best overall response (BOR) was partial response (PR) for 1 pt with increased HBV DNA and progressive disease for the remaining 6. HBV-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 6 of the 7 pts (2 pts had a Grade 3 TEAE of hepatitis B; 2 pts had a Grade 2 TEAE of HBV reactivation; 2 pts had a TEAE of increased HBV DNA, with one Grade 1 and one Grade 3 event). All HBV-related TEAEs were non-serious and did not result in discontinuation of TIS. Conclusions: Clinically significant increases in HBV DNA from BL were reported in a small number of pts, which does not suggest that TIS is associated with increased HBV DNA. Tumor responses in these pts were consistent with the overall population and HBV-related TEAEs were manageable and did not require discontinuation of TIS, demonstrating that HBV DNA increases did not impact treatment. The effects of TIS in pts with HBV infection will be further investigated in an ongoing Phase 3 trial (NCT03412773).",,,,L638833901,10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.e16181

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2022","2022","40","16",,,"1 Jun 2022","Background: CS1003 is a novel humanized, recombinant IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. LEN, a multi-kinase inhibitor of VEGFR 1-3, FGFR 1-4, PDGFRα, RET, and KIT, is approved as 1L treatment in pts with uHCC in multiple countries. A multi-regional, double-blinded, randomized phase 3 trial (CS1003-305, NCT04194775) of CS1003/placebo in combination with LEN as 1L treatment in uHCC is underway. The preliminary efficacy and safety data from the open-label phase 1b study of CS1003 + LEN as 1L treatment in uHCC after a median 6.2 months of follow-up were previously reported at ESMO Congress 2020. Here we present the updated results with a median 18.0 months of follow-up. Methods: Pts with uHCC, BCLC stage B or C, Child-Pugh class A, and ECOG PS ≤ 1 received 200 mg CS1003 intravenously once every 3 weeks and LEN orally (body weight ≥ 60 kg: 12 mg; < 60 kg: 8 mg) daily as 1L treatment. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by investigators per RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety. Data cutoff for this final analysis was August 13, 2021. Results: At data cutoff, a total of 20 pts had received treatment. Compared with the last preliminary analysis, confirmed ORR was changed from 30.0% to 45.0% (95% CI: 23.06%, 68.47%) with 9 pts achieving partial response. DCR was 90.0% with 9 pts having stable disease as best overall response. DOR ranged from 4.2 to 18.7+ months, and median DOR in all responders had not been reached. Median PFS was extended compared with the previous study readout from 8.4 months to 10.4 months (95% CI: 6.2, not estimable) with 6-month and 12-month PFS rates of 85.0% and 48.2%, respectively. Median OS had not been reached. All adverse events (AEs) were grade 1-3. Grade 3 AEs attributed to CS1003 and/or LEN occurred in 9 (45.0%) pts with the most common being gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (2 pts, 10.0%). Six (6) pts experienced grade 3 CS1003-related AEs, among whom, 4 pts also experienced grade 3 AEs related to LEN. Only 2 pts discontinued treatment due to AEs. There were no deaths due to AEs, and no new safety signals were identified. Conclusions: The antitumor activity of CS1003 + LEN combination as 1L treatment in Chinese pts with uHCC remains encouraging and durable through a longer follow-up period, and the safety profile is well tolerated and manageable. The PFS is longer and the ORR is higher compared to the data previously reported, which support further development as a combination treatment for improving outcomes in uHCC pts. The ongoing multi-regional, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (CS1003-305, NCT04194775) is currently recruiting and will further evaluate adding CS1003 to LEN as a 1L treatment in uHCC.",,,,L638833972,10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.e16191

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2022","2022","40","16",,,"1 Jun 2022","Background: Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is now standard first-line therapy for advanced HCC. Early phase trials in HCC and phase III trials in other solid tumors testing IO and TKI have shown greater antitumor activity with the combination than with either agent alone. Cancer and vascular endothelial cells release VEGF, which not only increases angiogenesis, promoting tumor growth, but also induces an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Preclinical studies suggest that TKIs with anti-VEGF activity have immunomodulatory potential, enabling the infiltration and activation of effector T cells to the TME. Experimental models of HCC with combination of IO plus TKI also reverted immune escape mechanisms mediated by β-catenin, Wnt, and TGFβ activation and by Treg or neutrophil infiltration. At our institution, pts who were treated with IO alone in the front line often had a TKI added on progression of disease (PD). We aimed to evaluate whether the addition of a TKI could rescue IO failure. Methods: We conducted an IRB-approved retrospective chart review of pts with unresectable HCC at Mount Sinai Health System who received IO from 1/2017 to 6/2021 and who subsequently received a TKI on PD. We assessed the objective response rate (ORR), median progression-free survival (mPFS) and overall survival (mOS). Follow-up CT/MRI imaging studies were conducted every 2-3 months after addition of TKI. Results: Of 277 pts who received first-line IO during the study period, 46 evaluable pts subsequently had TKIs added to IO upon PD. Pts were predominantly male (37/46), with median age 63 years, and 38 had cirrhosis. Etiologies of HCC were as follows: 9 HBV, 22 HCV, 15 alcohol-related, 7 NASH-associated. All pts received first-line nivolumab. TKIs added were lenvatinib (44/46) and sorafenib (2). At the start of IO, most pts (31/46) had Child Pugh class A liver disease and performance status ECOG 0 (31/46). TKIs were added upon PD and after a median of 5.8 months (range 2.1-28.1 months) from IO initiation. ORR of IO plus TKI was 15% (7/46; 2 complete responses and 5 partial responses). 16 pts had stable disease, and 13 had PD. Among the 11/46 pts who initially responded to first-line IO, 2 achieved a response with TKI. There were 5 responses among the 35/46 non-responders to first-line IO. TKI-related grade 3-4 adverse events, including liver toxicity, rash, and encephalopathy, led to discontinuation in 7/46 pts. mOS after adding TKI was 9.5 months (95% CI: 6.1-13.7) and mPFS was 5.4 months (95% CI: 3.6-9.7). The mOS and mPFS of adding TKI after PD did not differ between IO initial responders and non-responders. Overall, mOS from IO initiation was 17.6 months (95% CI: 14.5-24.4). Conclusions: Adding a TKI after PD on single agent IO in pts with advanced HCC did not add a signal of clinical benefit compared with reported outcomes from secondline TKIs alone.",,,,L638833993,10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.e16193

We assessed the safety and efficacy of triple therapy [Dona +anti-PD-1+ TACE] in uHCC in this Phase 1 study. Methods: The objective of this Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion study was to assess the MTD/recommended dose for Dona in combination of a fixeddose anti-PD-1 plus TACE in uHCC. The primary endpoint was DLT occurring in the first treatment cycle. Secondary endpoints included the overall safety and tolerability, ORR and PFS by mRECIST. Qualified pts (age 18-75) were enrolled if uHCC without macrovascular invasion (VP3/4) or extrahepatic spread; measurable disease by mRECIST; ECOG 0 to 1; Child-Pugh A; systemic therapy naive. Results: At the cut-off date (Dec 31 2021), data of 25 pts who underwent triple therapy from 6 cancer centers in China were analyzed (Table).

This study was aimed to compare the outcome of HCC patients who received TACE plus TKI agent versus TACE alone. Methods: Retrospectively all subjects with unresectable HCC were included in this study, who underwent liver transplantation (LT) and were treated by either TACE alone (TA) or TACE plus Sorafenib (TandS) between July 2008-December 2021. For categorical factors, HCC recurrence after LT was reported as frequencies and proportions, while for continuous variables, the median and interquartile range (IQR) or mean was used. For categorical variables, Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used, while for continuous variables, Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Results: Seven hundred patients were screened; only 128 patients in total underwent LT with most being males (77%); the median age of 61.5 years. The TA group included 79 (77%) subjects who matched Milan Criteria (MC) and 24 (23%) who did not, but the TandS group had a greater number of cases who did not meet MC: 16 (64%) versus 9 (36%); p = 0.01. There was a significant variation in five-year disease-free survival (DFS) across the therapy groups investigated, with 100% DFS in the TandS group vs 67.2 percent in the TAne group (p = 0.07). The TandS group had a fiveyear patient survival rate of 77.8% compared to 61.5 percent in the TA group (p = 0.51).

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2022","2022","40","16",,,"1 Jun 2022","Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with macrovascular invasion are consistently considered to be at an advanced stage of disease. The combination therapy of atezolizumab (atezo) plus bevacizumab (bev) has been the new standard-of-care for those patients. In patients responding to systemic therapy, hepatic resection may provide additional benefit. Here we propose a phase 3 study to investigate whether hepatic resection following atezo/bev can bring more benefits for HCC patients with macrovascular invasion when compared with atezo/bev alone. Methods: This is a multicenter, open-label, two-arm, randomized study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of surgical resection plus peri-operative atezo/bev compared with regular systemic atezo/bev (Q3W, every three weeks) in HCC patients with macrovascular invasion and without extrahepatic metastasis. Initially eligible patients have enrolled into induction phase, during which they receive 3 cycles of atezo/bev and 1 cycle of atezo alone as primary systemic therapy. Patients who are assessed as partial response or stable disease (RECIST v1.1 criteria) and considered suitable for R0 hepatic resection are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either Arm A, hepatic resection with post-operative atezo/bev for 1 year (or until loss of clinical benefit or intolerable toxic effects), or Arm B, continuing atezo/bev for 1 year (or until loss of clinical benefit or intolerable toxic effects). The primary endpoint of this study is time-to treatment failure (TTF), defined as time from randomization to the first documented treatment failure (i.e., tumor recurrence or metastasis [Arm A], disease progression [Arm B] according to RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause). We hypothesize that hepatic surgery with peri-operative atezo/bev will improve the TTF from 5.8 months to 9.2 months, with the hazard ratio of 0.63.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2022","2022","40","16",,,"1 Jun 2022","Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors can promote tumor regression and long-term survival in patients with advanced solid tumors. Despite the characteristic durability of response to ICI, unfortunately some patients may develop acquired resistance after an initial response. The underlying mechanism and effective measure are remarkably limited, perhaps restraining development of immunotherapies. The PRaG trial as a salvage therapy in patients with refractory metastatic solid tumors has obtained satisfactory results(Yuehong Kong et al. ASTRO 2021). With great surprise we found that patients with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors acquired resistance are more likely to benefit from the PRaG regimens. This is the PRaG regimen rechallenge that could represent an attractive option in advanced solid tumors. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical efficacy and safety of PRaG regimen (PD-1 inhibitors combined with radiotherapy and GM-CSF with or not IL-2) rechallenge to treat immunotherapy-refractory patients with advanced solid tumors. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of patients who showed initial resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were retrospectively collected from PRaG serial trails (ChiCTR1900020175 and NCT04892498). Patients received SBRT or HFRT (2-3 doses of 5-8Gy) to a target metastatic site, PD-1 inhibitor was dosing intravenously within one week after completion of SBRT or HFRT, and GM-CSF subcutaneous (SC) injection once daily for 14 days after radiotherapy(the PRaG 2.0 regimen, GM-CSF 200mg SC d1-7, sequentially IL-2 2million IU d8-14.). The specific PRaG regimens had been reported at the meeting of 2020 ASCO. Pooled analysis of response rate (ORR), median progression-free survival (mPFS), and treatment-related adverse events were calculated. Results: A total of 15 multi-metastatic patients were enrolled between October 2020 and February 2022. Thirteen patients showed acquired resistance and underwent at least one assessment, 5 patients were lung cancer, 3 patients were renal cancer, 2 patients were liver cancer, 2 patient was colon cancer, 1 patient was sarcoma. The ORR was 18.2%, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 90.9%. The median PFS was 8.87 months (95%CI, 1.41 to 16.33 months). One lung cancer achieved complete remission, with PFS over 17 months. Treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurred in 11 of 15(73.3%) patients, while there was no grade 3 or higher adverse events. Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggested that PRaG regimens rechallenge maybe an active and feasible strategy in PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors acquired resistance. The therapy was well tolerated and had acceptable toxicity.

Nivolumab is a recombinant human IgG4 mAb targeting PD-1 with clinically meaningful activity in about 15-20% of HCC patients, but the confirmatory phase III trial Checkmate 459 failed to demonstrate superiority over sorafenib. VEGF signaling is not only a driver of tumor angiogenesis, but also contributes to the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Combinations of anti-angiogenic multikinase inhibitors, specifically lenvatinib, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have demonstrated remarkable antitumor activity and manageable toxicity in several tumor types, including HCC. We therefore aimed to evaluate the efficacy of nivolumab in combination with lenvatinib as first line treatment in patients with advanced HCC. Methods: This investigator-initiated single-armed phase II trial (NCT03841201) recruited 50 patients (pts) at 8 sites in Germany between 07/2019 and 05/2021. Primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) according to investigator assessed RECIST 1.1 and safety/tolerability. Secondary endpoints included ORR according to iRECIST, time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Recruitment of the trial was completed in 05/2021.

Results: Between June, 2016 and August, 2021, a total of 315 patients in 5 centers were enrolled in to the study and eligible patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group (n = 157) or control group (n = 158) and were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Among these 14 patients from treatment group and 15 patients from control group were excluded from the per-protocol (PP) population. 148 patients in treatment group underwent at least 1 cycle of HAIC were included in safety analyses. The median DFS of treatment group and control group were 27.0 months (95% CI, 17.0-37.0) and 11.3 months (95% CI, 7.9-14.7), respectively in ITT population, while which was 20.4 months (95% CI, 9.5-31.3) and 9.7 months (95% CI, 6.9-12.4), respectively in PP population. The DFS were significantly better in the treatment group than in the control group in both ITT population and PP population (p = 0.001 and < 0.001, respectively). The DFS rates at 1, 2, and 3-years were 64.3%, 50.4%, and 44.3% in treatment group and 47.3%, 33.3%, and 24.2% in control group, respectively in ITT population, while which were 64.0%, 48.2%, and 42.2% in treatment group and 43.3%, 27.1%, and 18.4% in control group, respectively in PP population. The OS rates at 1, 2, and 3-year for the treatment group were 94.7%, 87.6%, and 80.5%, and were 91.9%, 85.9%, and 77.0% for the control group, respectively in ITT population, while which were 94.9%, 86.7%, and 80.9% in treatment group and 91.8%, 84.9%, and 75.3% in control group, respectively in PP population. Furthermore, in ITT population, there were 63 (40.1%) patients in the treatment group and 88 (55.7%) patients in the control group had recurrence. Majority of the AEs observed were grade 0-1 (n = 124 (83.8%)) and no treatment related death was observed during the study period. Conclusions: Postoperative adjuvant HAIC with FOLFOX significantly improved the survival benefits with acceptable toxicities in HCC patients with MVI.",,,,L638836126,10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.4013

J Clin Oncol 2022;40[suppl 4]. Abs 379). Methods: A pre-planned secondary objective of HIMALAYA was to assess pt-reported outcomes (PROs) in pts receiving STRIDE (T 300 mg plus D 1500 mg [one dose] plus D 1500 mg once every 4 weeks [Q4W]; N=393) or D (1500 mg Q4W; N=389) vs S (400 mg twice daily; N=389). The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 30-item Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire and the EORTC 18-item HCC QoL questionnaire were used to assess disease-related symptoms, physical functioning (PF), and Global Health Status (GHS)/ QoL. Time to deterioration (TTD), defined as time from randomization to first clinically meaningful deterioration (worsening ≥10 points) confirmed at a subsequent visit or death, was assessed in pts with baseline scores ≤90 for symptoms or ≥10 for PF and GHS/QoL. Results: Across treatment arms, compliance rates for PROs were >77% at baseline and >70% overall. Baseline scores were comparable across treatment arms. TTD in fatigue, appetite loss, abdominal pain, PF, and GHS/QoL were significantly longer for both STRIDE and D vs S (Table). TTD in nausea and abdominal swelling were significantly longer for STRIDE vs S.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2022","2022","40","16",,,"1 Jun 2022","Background: Anti-PD-1 monotherapy elicits various organ-specific immune responses. Although advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) showed 20-40% objective response rates (ORR) for cases of extrahepatic lesions in sites such as the lungs or lymph nodes (LNs), only 10% of intrahepatic lesions responded to the monotherapy. The organ-specific responses were due to tumor heterogeneity and differential microenvironments, and may have contributed to the failure of the phase III trials of anti-PD-1 monotherapy for aHCC. Recently, the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab (Ate/Bev) as first-line systemic treatment has resulted in survival benefits for patients with aHCC. However, the organ-specific response for this treatment has not been explored. We aimed to evaluate the organ-specific response to Ate/Bev combination therapy in patients with aHCC. Methods: We enrolled patients who received first-line Ate/Bev treatment for aHCC. Eligible patients included those with Child-Pugh A liver function, measurable tumor lesions, and serial image studies available for response evaluation. An independent radiologist reviewed the tumors located in the liver, lungs, LNs, and other sites. Organ-specific response criteria, adapted from RECIST 1.1 and immune-related RECIST, were used. Results: Between May 2020 and June 2021, 124 patients from two Korean cancer referral institutions received first-line Ate/Bev treatment for aHCC. The patient baseline characteristics included: hepatitis B (n = 85, 68.5%), hepatitis C (n = 6, 4.8%), non-viral (n = 33, 26.7%); BCLC stage A/B/C (n = 2, 1.6%/n = 19, 15.3%/n = 103, 83.1%); macrovascular invasion (n = 39, 31.5%); extrahepatic metastasis (n = 75, 60.5%); and AFP >400 ng/ml (n = 39, 31.5%). The median age was 62 years (range: 34-90). With median follow-up duration of 10.1 months, median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% CI, 3.6-10.0) and median overall survival was 16.9 months (95% CI, range not available). The ORR was 29.8%. For 260 individual tumor lesions, the liver was the most commonly involved organ (n = 152, 58.5%), followed by the LNs (n = 42, 16.2%) and lungs (n = 24, 9.2%). Ate/Bev treatment induced potent tumor shrinkage in both intrahepatic and extrahepatic lesions: ORR for hepatic lesions was 28.3%; LN lesions, 40.5%; lung lesions, 29.1%; and other metastatic lesions, 19.0%. Further, the organ-specific response rate for intrahepatic tumors decreased as the tumor size increased (36.7%: ≤50 mm, 13.0%: >50 mm). Conclusions: Unlike anti-PD-1 monotherapy, Ate/Bev combination therapy showed favorable responses even in intrahepatic lesions, which are comparable to those in extrahepatic lesions. As such, Ate/Bev may overcome an immune-tolerant hepatic microenvironment in patients with aHCC. (NCT04862949).",,,,L638836227,10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.4076

Meanwhile, more data were published from retrospective studies evaluating the sequence of single drug sorafenib and regorafenib in advanced HCC patients treated in real-world settings [eg, REFINE study (N = 1000; 100 from China)].We aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of regorafenib alone or in combinations in advanced HCC patients in a real-world setting. Methods: This retrospective multicenter study included pathologically or clinically diagnosed advanced HCC patients who received regorafenib alone or in combinations in first to fourth line settings for at least 28 consecutive days. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR, RECIST 1.1 criteria) and progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) rate at 6-month and 12-month, disease control rate (DCR) and safety. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival data. Results: A total of 61 advanced HCC patients (55 male vs. 6 female, 2 first-line recipients vs. 47 secondline recipients vs.11 third-line recipients vs. 1 fourth-line recipients, median age of 53.5 years) from 6 Chinese centers were included between January 2018 and June 2021. Most patients had BCLC stage C (96.7%) and a Child-Pugh A or B score in 23% or 57.4% of cases respectively. 23 (37.7%) patients received single drug regorafenib therapy, the remaining patients (62.3%) received different combination therapies, including regorafenib plus immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) (29.5%), regorafenib combined with TACE (14.8%), and triple therapy (TKI, ICI, TACE) (18.0%).

Here we present the results of prespecified exploratory HRQoL analyses. Methods: EORTC QLQ-C30 and EuroQol-5D3L (EQ5D-3L) questionnaires were administered at baseline (BL); wks 3, 6, 9, 12, 18; every 9 wks thereafter up to 1 yr or end of treatment; at treatment discontinuation, and at the 30-day safety follow-up visit. Pts who received ≥1 dose of study treatment and completed ≥1 HRQoL assessment were included in the analyses. Least squares mean (LSM) score changes from BL to wk 12 were compared using a constrained longitudinal data analysis model, including treatment by study visit interaction and stratification factors as covariates. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate time to deterioration (TTD) (time to 1st onset of ≥10-point decline from BL/confirmed by a 2nd adjacent ≥10-point decline from BL) for EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status (GHS)/QoL. Stratified Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (HR) between treatment arms in TTD with nominal, one-sided P value calculated. Results: The HRQoL population included 450 pts (298 pembro; 152 PBO). HRQoL compliance rate at wk 12 was 95.7% for pembro for both questionnaires and 94.4% for EORTC QLQ-C30 and 95.3% for EQ5D-3L for PBO. There was a statistically significant difference in LSM for change from BL to wk 12, between the two arms for the QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL score and EQ-5D VAS score, with more decline observed in the PBO arm. Difference in LSM for QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL score between pembro (-3.97; 95% CI, -6.38, -1.56) and PBO (-8.40; 95% CI, -11.71, -5.10) arms was 4.43 (95% CI, 0.47, 8.40; P= 0.0142). Difference in LSM for EQ-5D VAS score between pembro (-2.74; 95% CI, -4.51, -0.96) and PBO (-6.94; 95% CI, -9.40, -4.48) arms was 4.20 (95% CI, 1.21, 7.19; P= 0.0030). GHS/QOL mean scores generally remained stable over time in pembro arm. TTD in EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL score was similar between arms (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.58, 1.25; P= 0.1993). Conclusions: Over 12 wks, pts treated with PBO + BSC showed more decline in HRQoL than those receiving pembro + BSC.

Approvals were based on clinical trials with strict eligibility criteria limiting generalizability to the entire spectrum of clinical practice. Survival outcomes have not been evaluated in a real-world population and there is no established post ICI treatment standard. Methods: Patients (pts) with advanced HCC treated with ICI across lines of therapy were included in this retrospective study. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, HCC etiology, liver function (Child Pugh Score [CPS] and ALBI Grade [G]), tumor burden, AFP, treatments, reason for discontinuation (dc) and outcomes were collected. Descriptive statistics and survival analysis were performed using Stata with cox regression analysis. Results: The cohort consisted of 138 pts: median age 63 years (24,95); 83% male; 38% Hispanic/Latino, 27% Asian, 17% Non-Hispanic White, 4% Black and 14% other/unknown. Etiology of cirrhosis: 16% Hepatitis B, 38% Hepatitis C, 12% alcohol liver disease, 9% NAFLD and 24 % mixed/other; Baseline CPS were 74% CPA, 23% CPB, and 2% CPC; ALBI Scores were G1 in 35%, G2 in 53%, and G3 in 12% pts; 62% had extrahepatic disease and/or portal invasion; AFP was ≥ 400ng/mL in 30% of pts. 88% of pts had prior local therapy. For the entire cohort, first line systemic therapy consisted of 52% ICI (18% IC-C and 34% IC-SA) and 48% TKI. mOS was 12 months (mo) (0,74) for first line ICI group and 19.5 mo (3,78) in those with first line TKI. In CPA pts, first line therapy was 51% ICI (24% IC-C and 27% ICSA) and 39% TKI. 79% of CPA patients received ≥ 2 lines of therapy with second line consisting of 65% ICI and 20% TKI. First line therapy for pts with CPB cirrhosis was 58% ICI (2% IC-C and 55% IC-SA) and 42% TKI. 55% of CPB patients received ≥ 2 lines of therapy and second line therapy for CPB pts included 71% ICI and 18% TKI. mOS was 18 mo in CPA pts and 10 mo in CPB pts. Cirrhosis related complications resulted in treatment discontinuation in 2% of CPA pts vs. 14% of CPB pts. On multivariable analysis, Asian ethnicity (HR 0.41 p = 0.006), CPS (HR 1.64 p = 0.027), and number of treatment lines (HR 0.74 p = 0.005) were associated with OS. Conclusions: This single institution real-world cohort highlights the reality of sequential therapy in pts with advanced HCC. Survival outcomes in our CPA cohort are comparable to data from recent phase 3 trials. The survival in our CPB cohort in a tertiary care setting compares favorably with available data from clinical trials and suggests the feasibility of sequential and effective anti-cancer therapy in this population. Liver function, Asian ethnicity, and number of treatment lines are independent predictors of OS in this cohort of HCC patients receiving ICI.

In 2020, the results of IMbrave150 established the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab (A+B) as the novel standard of care for patients with uHCC. Parallel reporting of novel immunotherapy combinations tested in phase III trials against sorafenib limits therapeutic decision making in clinical practice, given direct comparison between novel first line treatment options does not exist. We conducted a network metanalysis (NMA) to compare A+B with other first line systemic therapies that reached their primary endpoint in phase III trials. Methods: After performing a literature review from January 2008 to February 2022, we identified 13709 studies for screening, 70 for revision, and the following 9 phase III trials for the analysis: SHARP, Asia Pacific, REFLECT, Check-Mate459, IMbrave150, ORIENT32, HIMALAYA, COSMIC312 and Qin et al.2021, which tested respectively: sorafenib (Sor) vs placebo (SHARP and Asia Pacific), lenvatinib (Len) vs Sor, nivolumab (Nivo) vs Sor, A+B vs Sor, Sintilimab+IBI305 vs Sor, Durvalumab+Tremelimumab (D+T) vs Sor, atezolizumab+ cabozantinib (A+C) vs Sor, and Donafenib vs Sor, as first line systemic treatments for uHCC. Hazard ratios(HR) and 95% confidence intervals(95%CI) for overall (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were extracted for each study. A frequentist network metanalysis, with fixed effect multivariable meta-regression models to estimate the indirect pooled HRs and corresponding 95%CI, was performed. CheckMate459 was the only trial testing PD-1 monotherapy and was included as a reference despite not reaching its primary endpoint. Results: In total, 6272 patients were included in the analysis, among them, 5896 received active treatment and 376 had placebo. Amongst analyzed treatment regimens, A+B reduced the risk of death by 60% compared to placebo (HR 0.40; 95%CI 0.28-0.57), and by 42%, 37%, 36% and 32% compared to Sor (HR 0.58; 95%CI 0.43-0.79), Len (HR 0.63; 95%CI 0.45-0.89), A+C (HR 0.64; 95%CI 0.43-0.97) and Nivo (HR 0.68; 95%CI 0.48-0.98), respectively. With regards to OS, D+T was not significantly inferior to A+B (HR 0.74; 95%CI 0.52-1.06) and the efficacy of sintilimab+IBI305 was similar to A+B (HR 1.02; 95%CI 0.67-1.54). Considering PFS, A+B was significantly superior to placebo, Sor, donafenib and Nivo. Conclusions: In this network metanalysis comparing 9 landmark phase III trials in uHCC, we confirmed combination of immunotherapy with PD-1 pathway plus VEGF blockade (A+B, sintilimab+IBI305) to be associated to the highest reduction in the risk of death compared to other regimens. Within the methodological limits of this NMA, we provide evidence for the first time of comparable efficacy in terms of OS and PFS for D+T and A+B.",,,,L638836433,10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.4098

REACH-2 confirmed the RAM treatment benefit for patients with baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL, consistent with results in a prespecified subgroup of patients in REACH with AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. A pooled analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RAM in Chinese patients (including patients from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) from REACH-2 and REACH with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL. Methods: Except for AFP level requirement, REACH-2 and REACH were similar in study design and included patients who had advanced HCC (BCLC stage C or B disease refractory or not amenable to locoregional therapy), Child-Pugh A, ECOG PS 0-1, and prior sorafenib. Patients were randomized to RAM (8 mg/kg) I.V. or PL Q2W, plus best supportive care, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Individual patient data were pooled from REACH-2 and REACH (AFP ≥400 mg/mL). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model. Objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety were reported. Efficacy analyses were stratified by study to account for any potential difference in the two studies. Results: Data from 155 Chinese patients were pooled from REACH (51) and REACH-2 (104) (N = 98 RAM vs N = 57 PL). Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between arms in pooled data set; however, lower median level of AFP was noted in the RAM arm. In the pooled population, RAM treatment numerically improved OS over PL (median OS 7.1 months vs 4.7 months; HR = 0.735 [95% CI: 0.512, 1.055]). Improvements in PFS (median PFS 2.6 months vs 1.5 months; HR = 0.666 [95% CI: 0.459, 0.967]), ORR (3.1% vs 0%), and DCR (44.9% vs 29.8%) were also observed.

Treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 175 (55.6%) pts receiving luspatercept vs 31 (28.4%) receiving placebo; 23 (7.3%) pts in luspatercept vs 1 (0.9%) in placebo arm discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. Rate of discontinuation was comparable to the primary data cut (Table). Three of 5 pts died during the study due to TEAEs; no deaths were study drug-related. TEAEs more frequent with luspatercept included headache, arthralgia, bone pain, dizziness, nausea, hypertension, jaw pain, and hyperuricemia; similar to TEAEs reported in the primary data cut. No premalignant conditions were reported; the 2 reported malignancies (acute erythroid leukemia and hepatocellular carcinoma) were unrelated to the study drug. Median (range) time to TEE was 474.0 (75-1184) vs 238.0 (238-238) d with luspatercept vs placebo, respectively. TEEs occurred in 13 (4.1%) vs 1 (0.9%) pts in the luspatercept vs placebo arms, respectively; all pts were splenectomized and had ≥1 other TEE risk factor. Similar rates of TEEs with luspatercept were reported in the primary data cut (8 pts [3.6%]). Bone pain was more frequent with luspatercept vs placebo (21.6% vs 8.3%), comparable with the primary data cut (19.7%). Bone pain was mild and occurred more commonly in wk 1-24. Median (range) time to first bone pain event was 24.5 (1-947) vs 16.0 (1- 342) d in the luspatercept and placebo arms, respectively. Hypertension was reported in 8.9% vs 2.8% of pts in the luspatercept and placebo arms, respectively; median (range) time to first hypertension event was 209.5 (2-1136) vs 176.0 (148-464) d. Rates of hypertension with luspatercept were comparable between the 2 data cutoffs. Summary/Conclusion: In this long-term analysis, treatment discontinuations due to TEAEs were more common in the luspatercept arm compared with placebo, as expected due to longer treatment exposure, and similar to the discontinuation rate reported in the primary data cut. No new safety concerns were reported and occurrence of TEAEs of special interest (bone pain, hypertension, and TEE) was comparable with previous reports. Overall, longterm safety analysis showed results consistent with the safety profile of luspatercept. (Figure Presented).",,,,L638940018,10.1097/01.HS9.0000852292.38263.b8

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of NAFLD, is likely to become the leading cause of cirrhosis and etiology for liver transplantation in future decades in the Western World. Most patients with NAFLD have some components of metabolic syndrome, including obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. NAFLD encompasses a wide spectrum of liver damage, ranging from simple steatosis to NASH, that can progress to advanced liver disease, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma. Unfortunately, the options for the pharmacological treatment of NASH are still very limited. Nonetheless, several classes of therapies have shown promise, and are currently being evaluated in large phase 2b and phase 3 trials, creating some hope that selected agents will be approved in the coming years. As NASH is a heterogeneous disease, multiple mechanistic pathways are being targeted to achieve optimal treatment response. Combination therapy is also on the horizon, where 2 or more drugs targeting different mechanistic pathways are being used to boost the clinical response. In this review, we first present the current concept of the pathophysiology of NASH, focusing on the pathways currently targeted in clinical trials. We then present the pharmacological agents that are being evaluated in phase IIb of clinical development and beyond, using histological outcomes, and finally we present preliminary results from the combination trials that have already been initiated.",,,,L2016880746,10.20524/aog.2022.0704

We previously defined and validated a composite score of a serum-based 8-protein Prognostic Liver Secretome signature (PLSec) with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), named PLSec-AFP, for prediction of long-term HCC risk in multiple cohorts of cirrhosis patients. Methods: To further evaluate clinical utility of PLSec-AFP, we conducted a phase 3 cancer biomarker study in the NCI EDRN Hepatocellular Carcinoma Early Detection Study (HEDS) cohort, in which cirrhosis patients were prospectively enrolled and monitored by semi-annual HCC screening at 7 U.S. centers, following the prospective specimen collection, retrospective blinded evaluation (PRoBE) design. Incident HCC was diagnosed per the American Association for Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines. Association of PLSec-AFP with incident HCC was assessed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. A hazard ratio [HR] of >2 was pre-defined as the threshold to enable a cost-effective individual-risk-based HCC screening as shown in a prior Markov-model-based simulation analysis. Results: PLSec- AFP was tested in 1,300 evaluable patients with a median age of 60 years (interquartile range [IQR], 54-66) and 694 (53.4%) males. During a median follow-up of 2.6 years (IQR, 1.4-4.2), 102 HCCs developed. PLSec-AFP identified 292 (22.5%) high-risk and 1,008 (77.5%) low-risk patients. The cumulative HCC incidence rates at 3 years were 4.5% and 13.5% in low- and high-risk patients, respectively. The HR of high-risk PLSec-AFP was 2.66 (95% confidence interval, 1.79-3.96; p<0.0001). Conclusion: PLSec-AFP was successfully validated for HCC risk stratification in the nationwide prospective-retrospective cirrhosis cohort in this phase 3 biomarker validation study. This result warrants its further clinical evaluation and translation to enable cost-effective, individual-risk-based HCC screening in cirrhosis patients.",,,,L2018832520,10.1016/S0016-5085(22)63421-8

The aim of this study was conducted a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). A total of 1657 patients were included. The completed phase III trials with details data, such as overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse effects (AEs) were included. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) of OS and PFS were.75 (95% CI:.61–.92) and.74 (95% CI:.56–.97) with heterogeneity between PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors groups and control groups. Sensitivity analysis revealed IMbrave-150 could be the most important factor of heterogeneity for OS, while CheckMate-459 was the main fact of heterogeneity for PFS. In addition, the relative risk (RR) of ORR and DCR were 2.43 (95% CI: 1.80–3.26) and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.11–1.43) with low heterogeneity in PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors groups. The therapeutic effect of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors was better in females, Asia without Japan, BCLC status C and infected hepatitis groups. The RR of AEs from any cause and serious adverse events (SAEs) for patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were 1.03 (95% CI:.93–1.13) and 1.13 (95% CI:.89–1.44), respectively. Pruritus was the most common AEs reported in 10% of patients or more (RR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.33–2.15).

On August 31, 2020, after a median 15.6 (range, 0-28.6) months of follow-up, the median OS was 19.2 months (95% CI 17.0–23.7) with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and 13.4 months (95% CI 11.4–16.9) with sorafenib (hazard ratio [HR] 0.66; 95% CI 0.52-0.85; descriptive p <0.001). The median PFS was 6.9 (95% CI 5.7-8.6) and 4.3 (95% CI 4.0-5.6) months in the respective treatment groups (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.53-0.81; descriptive p < 0.001). Treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 143 (43%) of 329 and 72 (46%) of 156 safety-evaluable patients in the respective groups, and treatment-related grade 5 events occurred in 6 (2%) and 1 (<1%) patients. Conclusion: After longer follow-up, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab maintained clinically meaningful survival benefits over sorafenib and had a safety profile consistent with the primary analysis. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03434379. Lay summary: The primary analysis of IMbrave150 showed that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab had significantly greater benefits than sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, but survival data were not yet mature. At this updated analysis done 12 months later, median overall survival was 5.8 months longer with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab than sorafenib, and the severity profile of treatment-related side effects remained similar. These updated results confirm atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as the first-line standard of care for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03434379)",,34902530,L2016737585,10.1016/j.jhep.2021.11.030

Recent chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer (FOLFIRINOX) improves median survival from 2–4 months to approximately 11 months in phase III trials. Even though this regimen increased survival, since the implementation of the POLST in Korea, paradigm it began to change. We described and analyzed the status of POLST and treatment in the real world and discuss about principle of palliative care focused on HBP malignancy. Method: Between February 2018 and December 2019, we reviewed the terminal stage hepatobiliary and pancreas cancer patient who have already agree with POLST retrospectively. Result: Total 158 patients of HBP malignancy were analyzed. The mean age was 65 years and proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer was 20.2% vs. 37.9% vs 41.9%. Symptoms were reported differently according to the types of cancer, In the case of hepatocellular carcinoma, 70% of patients suffered from abdominal distension due to malignant ascites, and 84% of patients of biliary tract cancer had jaundice and itching sense. Opioid analgesics were significantly used common in 96% of pancreatic cancer. Patients with HCC and biliary tract cancer had a high rate of treatment such as PTBD and PCD even after POLST. Previous operation history was significantly related with gastrointestinal obstructive symptom. Conclusion: In the era of POLST, palliative treatments have become a major issue. Depending on the symptoms associated with the type of cancer, appropriate treatment should be applied and it will be a good way to improve QOL in terminal cancer patients",,,,L2017920439,10.1016/j.ijsu.2022.106300

The recent ORIENT-32 study showed the significant survival benefit of sintilimab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) plus IBI305 (a bevacizumab biosimilar) in advanced HCC. This study updates a previous network meta-analysis of systematic treatment options in the first-line setting in patients with advanced HCC. Material and methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for abstracts and full-text articles published from database inception through July 2021. Phase 3 trials that evaluated systematic therapies including vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors, or their combinations in advanced HCC, in the first-line setting for advanced HCC were included. Main outcomes were overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The random effects model was used to pool the overall effect via R package “netmeta”. Results: Nine trials at low risk of bias were included. Network meta-analysis showed that sintilimab plus IBI305 and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab were all superior compared with other systematic agents in OS and PFS. Sintilimab plus IBI305 is equivalent to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in OS (hazard ratio 0.98, 0.65-1.50) and PFS (hazard ratio 0.98, 0.85- 1.12). The combination of sintilimab and IBI305 also showed superior to lenvatinib, sorafenib and nivolumab.

Physiologically, the intrinsic microenvironment in the liver is immunosuppressive, which represents a major obstacle for effective immune therapies in primary and secondary liver malignancies. For this reason, combination therapies that can overcome immune inhibitory mechanisms and enhance the immune response are a rationale approach for drug development in HCC. A recent example is the combination of the anti-PD-L1 antibody (atezolizumab) and anti-VEGF-A antibody (bevacizumab), which has shown significant improvement in survival as compared to standard of care in the first-line treatment for HCC.

Analyzing trends in clinical outcomes of patients treated with sorafenib for the same indication over time offers the opportunity for unique insight into the evolution of clinical trial conduct and potential non-drug factors impacting outcomes. Methods: We identified RCTs in patients with treatment-naïve advanced HCC where sorafenib was compared to another systemic therapy or placebo. We extracted trial-level demographic, clinicopathologic, and outcome data (overall survival [OS], progression-free survival [PFS], objective response rate [ORR], and duration of therapy). Sample-weighted linear regression was used to identify temporal trends with significance set at p ≤ 0.05. Results: Sixteen RCTs (9 phase III and 7 phase II) enrolling 4,086 patients treated with sorafenib were included in the analysis. Included trials enrolled patients from 2005 to 2019. OS has significantly improved by 4.5 months from 2005 to 2019 (p = 0.048) over time.

NAFLD is closely linked to the metabolic syndrome, and comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, obesity and insulin resistance aggravate liver disease, while NAFLD promotes cardiovascular risk in affected patients. The pathomechanisms of NAFLD are multifaceted, combining hepatic factors including lipotoxicity, mechanisms of cell death and liver inflammation with extrahepatic factors including metabolic disturbance and dysbiosis. Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a family of ligand-controlled transcription factors that regulate glucose, fat and cholesterol homeostasis and modulate innate immune cell functions, including liver macrophages. In parallel with metabolic derangement in NAFLD, altered NR signaling is frequently observed and might be involved in the pathogenesis. Therapeutically, clinical data indicate that single drug targets thus far have been insufficient for reaching patient-relevant endpoints. Therefore, combinatorial treatment strategies with multiple drug targets or drugs with multiple mechanisms of actions could possibly bring advantages, by providing a more holistic therapeutic approach. In this context, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and other NRs are of great interest as they are involved in wide-ranging and multi-organ activities associated with NASH progression or regression.

Resident macrophages and leukocytes exert a key role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. In particular, CD4+ effector T cells are activated during the early stages of liver inflammation and are followed by the increase of natural killer T cells and of CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocytes which contribute to auto-aggressive tissue damage. To counteract T cells activation, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PDL-1 are exposed respectively on lymphocytes and liver cells’ surface and can be targeted for therapy by using specific monoclonal antibodies, such as of Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and Atezolizumab.

We provide a brief update of this rapidly evolving field, with specific focus on the development in the field of predictive factors and the immunomodulation induced by locoregional therapies.Recent findingsEven if the immune contexture of HCC before the treatment remains the most promising predictive marker for response to immunotherapies, recent findings show that the cause of HCC may have also a key role. Specific inflammatory mechanisms induced by NASH may result in limited efficacy of immunotherapy compared with viral HCC. Other recent findings showed that percutaneous ablations are responsible for intratumoral immune changes and systemic immune system activation that may help to prevent recurrence when combined with immunotherapies. In case of multifocal HCC, transarterial therapies (TACE and SIRT) may help to turn a cold tumor type to a hot tumor type and could be associated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors to improve outcomes.SummaryThe future HCC management will focus on patient stratification for specific immunotherapies depending on the signature and cause of HCC and the best combined approaches in which locoregional therapies may play a pivotal role.",,,34923550,L2016818015,10.1097/CCO.0000000000000812

Most cases (90%) of HCC arise in the setting of a chronic liver disease. The advanced stages of HCC are amendable only to systemic treatment. Systemic therapy has been revolutionized by immune-based therapies. However, a recent meta-analysis of three randomized phase III clinical trials that tested inhibitors of PD-L1 or PD1 in more than 1,600 patients with advanced HCC, revealed that immune therapy did not improve survival in patients with non-viral HCC. Aim: The aim of the study was to identify differences in immune cell population of patients with HCC, according to etiopathogenesis of cirrhosis, in order to identify different patterns that may be targeted for immunotherapy. Patients and Methods: We analyzed 50 leukocyte sub-populations, using flow cytometric technique, in a cohort of 111 consecutive HCC cirrhotic patients with different etiopathogenesis. Differences between groups were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: We divided HCC patients with cirrhosis into five groups according to etiology of liver disease: alcoholic, viral (HCV/HBV), metabolic (NAFLD/NASH), overlap between etiological factors and other etiology. Leukocyte sub-populations were significantly different in two groups. Specifically in the group of alcoholic etiology there were increased levels of PMN (p<0.01), monocytes (p<0.01) and NKT cells CD57+RA-(4-8-) (p=0.011), while in viral etiology group there were increased levels of T cells CD57-RA+(4-8-) (p=0.007) and T cell CD3+ (4-8-) (p=0.009). No specific leukocyte subpopulation was significantly increased in the other groups, in particular in the metabolic one. Conclusions: These data suggest that in liver disease with different etiopathogenesis there are different immunological microenvironments. Innate and innate-like cells are the principal regulators of immune response in alcoholic HCC, while adaptive immune system is predominant in viral etiology. This suggests that differences in cancer-mediated immune escape could explain the different response to immunotherapy and may be helpful in identification of responder patients to new HCC therapy",,,,L2017052716,10.1016/j.dld.2022.01.010

As such, trials assessing symptom burden and supportive interventions are crucial. Here, we characterise the landscape of phase III GI cancer clinical trials and explore study outcomes centred on the patient's quality of life (QoL). Methods We searched ClinicalTrials.gov for phase III randomised controlled trials (RCTs) registered between 2000 and 2017 that are assessing a therapeutic intervention in adult patients with cancer and grouped trials by GI disease sites. Results Overall, we identified 76 phase III trials specific to GI cancers that enrolled a total of 53 725 patients. When analysing the primary outcomes measured, the vast majority of studies (n=71, 86%) measured disease-related endpoints such as progression-free survival or overall survival. All trials had a secondary endpoint that measured adverse events, but only 30 trials (39%) included QoL measures as secondary endpoints. Of the 30 trials that included QoL secondary endpoints, only 16 (53%) reported these results. Only five trials (7%) assessed interventions aimed at supportive measures impacting disease-related or treatment-related toxicity. None of the supportive trials included QoL as a primary endpoint and only two of these trials (40%) included QoL as a secondary endpoint. Conclusions Most GI cancer trials failed to incorporate patient-centred outcomes or QoL measures when studying new interventions. These findings call for greater integration of patient-reported metrics, which may lead to better care and outcomes for patients with GI malignancies.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00316914, NCT00582426, NCT00911170, NCT00994110, NCT01596283)",,,L633056743,10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002538

METHODS In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with advanced HCC, previously untreated with systemic therapy, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive HAIC-FO or sorafenib. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) in the intention-to-treat population. An exploratory model for predicting the efficacy of HAIC-FO on the basis of genomic sequencing was developed. RESULTS Between May 2017 and May 2020, 262 patients were randomly assigned. The median tumor size was 11.2 cm (interquartile range, 8.5-13.7 cm). Macrovascular invasion was present in 65.6%, and the percentage of patients with. 50% tumor volume involvement of the liver and/or Vp-4 portal vein tumor thrombosis was 49.2%. At data cutoff (October 31, 2020), median OS was 13.9 months for HAIC-FO and 8.2 for sorafenib (hazard ratio [HR] 0.408; 95% CI, 0.301 to 0.552; P,.001). Tumor downstaging occurred in 16 (12.3% of 130) patients receiving HAIC-FO, including 15 receiving curative surgery or ablation, and finally achieving a median OS of 20.8 months, with a 1-year OS rate of 93.8%. In high-risk subpopulations, OS was significantly longer with HAIC-FO than with sorafenib (10.8 months v 5.7 months; HR 0.343; 95% CI, 0.219 to 0.538; P,.001). A newly developed 15-mutant-gene prediction model identified 83% of patients with response to HAIC-FO. HAIC-FO responders had longer OS than HAIC-FO nonresponders (19.3 months v 10.6 months; HR 0.323; 95% CI, 0.186 to 0.560; P 5.002).

Most HCCs occur in patients with liver cirrhosis, and the competing mortality risks from the tumor and the cirrhosis should be considered. Presently, previously identified risk factors, such as hepatitis virus infection, hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, and metabolic syndrome, may be used as chemoprevention targets. The application of precision medicine for HCC management challenges the one-size-fits-all concept; moreover, patients should no longer be treated entirely according to the histology of their tumor but based on molecular targets specific to their tumor biology. Next-generation sequencing emphasizes HCC molecular heterogeneity and aids our comprehension of possible vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Moreover, genetic sequencing as part of a precision medicine concept may work as a promising tool for postoperative cancer monitoring. The use of genetic and epigenetic markers to identify therapeutic vulnerability could change the diagnosis and treatment of HCC, which so far was based on Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) staging. In daily clinical practice, the shift from a stage-oriented to a therapeutic-oriented approach is needed to direct the choice of HCC treatment toward the potentially most effective option on an individual basis. The important factor in precision medicine is the promotion of patient management based on the individual approach, knowing that the final decision must be approved by a multidisciplinary expert team.",,,,L2015584958,10.3390/jpm12020149

The aim of the present study was to provide an insight into the features of anti-tumor drugs approved in Europe; (2) Methods: We included all the indications for solid tumors issued by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) between 2015 and 2020. We extracted data from European Public Assessments Reports (EPAR), including drug name, mechanism of action, setting, features of pivotal clinical trials, primary end-points, quality of life (QoL); (3) Results: In the explored period, EMA issued 132 new indications (81 indications’ extensions) for 62 oncology drugs. In about half of indications (47%), the approval was biomarker-based. Immune check point inhibitors (ICIs) and signal transduction inhibitors were the two most representative drug categories (62%). Most of the indications were for the advanced setting (91%) and front-line therapy (66%). The most common tumor types were non-small cell lung cancer (24%), breast (16%), and melanoma (10%). Two thirds of the indications (73%) were approved based on phase III trials. Overall survival (OS) represented the primary end-point only in 39% of indications, mainly limited to advanced setting (98%) and ICI trials (80%). Almost all (94%) cell cycle and DNA repair mechanism inhibitors were approved based on progression free survival (PFS) data. In pivotal trials with signal transduction inhibitors, objective response rate (ORR) was the prevalent (45%) primary end-point. QoL was never considered as primary end-point; (4) Conclusions: In this analysis, we intended to offer an updated picture of the recent drug development in oncology. Most of the efforts led to broadening indications of pre-existing molecules, with signal transduction inhibitor and ICIs contending the leadership.

Recently, immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been shown with encouraging anticancer activity and safety in clinical trials. To reverse the phenomenon of tumours evading immune response, ICIs can be used to stimulate the natural antitumour potential of cancer cells by blocking the relevant checkpoints to activate T cells. However, the components and functions of the immune system may undergo a series of changes with ageing, known as ‘immunosenescence,’ potentially affecting the antitumour effect and safety of immunotherapy. In the current phase III clinical trials of ICIs including nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, the proportion of patients with HCC older than 65 years in CheckMate 459, KEYNOTE-240 and IMbrave150 is 51%, 58% and 50%, respectively, which is less than 70%–73% of epidemiological investigation. Therefore, the elderly population recruited in clinical trials may not accurately represent the real-world elderly patients with HCC, which affects the extrapolation of the efficacy and safety profile obtained in clinical trials to the elderly population in the real world. This review provides the latest advances in ICIs immuno-treatment available for HCC and relevant information about their therapeutic effects and safety on elderly patients. We discuss the benefits of ICIs for older HCC patients, and relevant recommendations about conducting further clinical trials are proposed for more complete answers to this clinical issue.",,,34954439,L2016053418,10.1016/j.ejca.2021.11.024

Studies have shown the increased de novo lipogenesis in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples. Multiple mechanisms, such as activation of the AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, lead to high SREBP1 induction and the coordinated enhanced expression of ACLY, ACACA, FASN, and SCD genes.

Objective response rate by independent committee review (IRC) in pts with a history of HBV infection was consistent with the overall population (12.5% vs. 13.3%, respectively). We explored whether TIS treatment was associated with increased HBV DNA and the clinical significance of HBV DNA elevations. Methods: Pts with ≥ 1 prior systemic therapy for advanced HCC received TIS 200 mg IV Q3W. Pts with inactive, chronic, or active HBV were eligible if HBV DNA levels were < 500 IU/mL at screening (pts with detectable hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] or detectable HBV DNA were required to be managed per treatment guidelines). HBV DNA testing was conducted every 4 cycles if HBV DNA was detectable at screening, or when clinically indicated. Results: Among 249 enrolled pts, 128 had a history of HBV infection. Of these pts, 114 were HBsAg positive at baseline (BL), 36 had detectable HBV DNA at BL, and 32 had detectable HBV DNA and HBsAg at BL. Clinically significant increases in HBV DNA levels from BL were reported in 7 pts, with no pattern relative to the time of TIS initiation (Table). All 7 pts were HBsAg positive at BL and had been receiving antiviral treatment for ≥ 3 months before the first dose of TIS. Six out of the 7 pts had increases in alanine transaminase (ALT) from BL during the study (Table), 4 of whom had ≥ 3-fold increases in ALT which were observed concurrently or soon after HBV DNA increases. IRC-assessed best overall response (BOR) was partial response (PR) for 1 pt with increased HBV DNA and progressive disease for the remaining 6. HBV-related treatmentemergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 6 of the 7 pts (2 pts had a grade 3 TEAE of hepatitis B; 2 pts had a grade 2 TEAE of HBV reactivation; 2 pts had a TEAE of increased HBV DNA, with one grade 1 and one grade 3 event). All HBV-related TEAEs were non-serious and did not result in discontinuation of TIS. Conclusions: Clinically significant increases in HBV DNA from BL were reported in a small number of pts, which does not suggest that TIS is associated with increased HBV DNA. Tumor responses in these pts were consistent with the overall population and HBV-related TEAEs were manageable and did not require discontinuation of TIS, demonstrating that HBV DNA increases did not impact treatment.

Conversely, lenvatinib has shown a good response rate in the phase III trial REFLECT and was considered promising as an initial treatment for patients with BCLC stage B2 HCC. Methods: We conducted a multicenter prospective observational study to evaluate the efficacy of lenvatinib as an initial treatment for pts aged 20 years or older, diagnosed with BCLC stage B2 HCC, naive to TACE, and with preserved organ function. The primary endpoint was a 1-year survival rate, with a threshold of 60% and an expected survival rate of 78% based on previous reports of TACE. With a one-sided alpha error of 5% and a power of 70%, 25 pts were recruited over an enrollment period of 2 years and a follow-up period of 10 months. Results: Enrollment began in June 2018 and was closed with 31 eligible pts enrolled by June 2020. Data cut-off was done in April 2021. Patient characteristics are as follows: the median age was 77 years (range: 57-86); 94% of the pts were male; the etiology of chronic liver disease was hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, alcohol abuse, and others in 3, 6, 9, and 10 pts, respectively; 20 and 11 pts had a Child-Pugh score of 5 and 6 points, respectively; the median maximum tumor diameter was 36 mm (range: 10-135); the number of pts with a tumor number of ≥10 was 8; and the median AFP level was 52.1 ng/mL (range: 2.4-49800). The 1-year survival rate was 71.0% (90% confidence interval [CI]: 68.4-73.6) and the primary endpoint was met. The median overall and progression-free survival was 17.0 months (95% CI, 15.3-19.2) and 10.4 months (95% CI, 6.6-13.8), respectively; the 2-year survival rate was 32.3%.

The trial is registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (s031190057). Results: Between July 2019 and January 2021, 49 patients from 11 centers were enrolled in this trial. One patient who died because of an accidental trauma immediately after study enrollment was excluded. The complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rate of the 48 patients were 0% and 13% based on RECIST and 2% and 35% based on mRECIST, respectively. An R0, R1, and R2 resection was performed in 27 (56%), 2 (4%), and 4 patients (8%), respectively. Among the 15 unresected cases, the reasons for not undergoing surgery were inadequate response to lenvatinib in 10 patients (21%), decline of performance status in 2 patients (4%), refusal of surgery in 2 patients (4%), and worsening of comorbidities in 1 patient (2%). Postoperative 90-day mortality was not observed in any patients. Complications ≥grade III according to the Clavien-Dindo classification included bile leakage in 4 patients (8%) and intra-abdominal abscess in 3 patients (6%). The 1-year OS rate was 75.9%. Conclusions: This trial, which was the first prospective trial assessing conversion surgery, demonstrated the feasibility of conversion surgery after lenvatinib therapy in patients with initially unresectable HCC. The response rate of lenvatinib was similar to that of the REFLECT trial. Postoperative complications directly related to the administration of lenvatinib were not observed, suggesting the safety of preoperative lenvatinib therapy.",,,,L637296452,10.1200/JCO.2022.40.4_suppl.458

Combination therapy with TACE and molecular targeted agents has been reported to have higher antitumor efficacy than respective monotherapies. This study aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of combination of TACE and lenvatinib in uHCC patients. Methods: Phase II, prospective, multicenter, single-arm study was conducted in 19 Japanese sites. Lenvatinib was administered orally once daily for 14 to 21 days prior to TACE at a dose of 12 mg (body weight ≥60 kg) or 8 mg (< 60 kg). The first TACE was performed after a 2-day lenvatinib withdrawal period. This combination therapy was repeated until the time to untreatable progression (TTUP). The primary endpoint was progressionfree survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included TTUP, objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results: Between February 2019 and April 2020, 62 patients were enrolled. Median age was 72.0 years (< 65 years, 13 [21.0%]; ≥65 years, 49 [79.0%]). Number of patients with Child-Pugh score 5 and 6 was 51 (82.3%) and 11 (17.7%); Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0 and 1 was 59 (95.2%) and 3 (4.8%); and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage A and B was 25 (40.3%) and 37 (59.7%). The number of previous TACE procedures was 0 in 35 patients (56.5%) and 1 to 3 in 27 patients (43.5%). The estimated median PFS, OS, and TTUP were more than 2 years. The ORR was 88.7% (90% CI 79.8 - 94.6 with complete response (CR) rate of 66.1%). Treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) occurred in 98.4% of patients, and the most common AEs were hypothyroidism (58.1%), hypertension (53.2%), decreased appetite (50.0%), and fatigue (48.4%). Grade 3 and 4 AEs occurred in 71.0% and 4.8%, and serious AEs occurred in 40.3%. One death not causally related to the protocol treatment was observed. Conclusions: In this final analysis, the combination of TACE and lenvatinib showed promising therapeutic efficacy in patients with uHCC. No new safety signal was observed.

Date of Publication: 1 Feb 2022","2022","40","4 SUPPL",,,"1 Feb 2022","Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant liver cancer and a leading cause of cancer related mortality. Sorafenib was the first approved systemic treatment for HCC, and remains one of few front-line treatments for this malignancy. Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low intensity (1-3 V/cm), intermediate frequency (100-500 kHz), alternating electric fields that exert antimitotic effects on cancerous cells. Results of the phase 2 HEPANOVA study of TTFields (150 kHz) plus sorafenib for advanced HCC support investigation of TTFields in a randomized controlled phase 3 study. The current research aimed to describe the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of this combination and to elucidate details regarding the underlying mechanism of action. Methods: In vitro examinations were performed in HepG2 and Huh-7D12 human HCC cell lines, to which TTFields at a frequency of 150 kHz were applied using the inovitro system. Autophagy was examined by western blot and fluorescence detection of microtubuleassociated protein light chain 3 (LC3) levels, an accepted autophagy marker. The effect of TTFields in combination with sorafenib was evaluated using cytotoxic, clonogenic, and apoptotic assays. In vivo, SD rats were inoculated orthotopically into the left hepatic lobe with N1S1 HCC cells. 7 days later, TTFields or sham (heat) were applied to the abdominal region of the rats, continuously for 6 days. Daily intraperitoneal injections of sorafenib (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle were performed during this time. To determine tumor volume growth, MRI images were acquired before and after treatment. Levels of autophagy and apoptosis were examined in tumor sections by immunohistochemistry for LC3 and cleaved PARP, respectively. Results: Application of TTFields induced autophagy in HCC cells. TTFields delivery was cytotoxic to the cells, reduced their colony forming ability, and induced apoptosis while combination with sorafenib elevated these effects. In vivo, tumor volume increased 6-fold in control animals vs 1.6-fold in animals treated with TTFields plus sorafenib. This effect was accompanied by significantly elevated levels of cleaved PARP and LC3 within the tumors of treated relative to control rats. Conclusions: The results demonstrate induction of autophagy and apoptosis in HCC following treatment with TTFields. Concomitant application of TTFields with sorafenib enhanced efficacy via a mechanism that may involve overwhelming autophagy, in vitro and in vivo.",,,,L637296587,10.1200/JCO.2022.40.4_suppl.464

Immune check point inhibitors and its combination therapies are completely ineffective in some population of patients based on previous reports in several other malignancies. Regarding the results of a phase III trial (IMbrave 150) and several reports from real world practice,∼20% of patients were determined to be progression disease (PD) as the best radiological response to Atezo + Bev in patients with advanced HCC. In this study, we analyzed the tumor microenvironment using tumor biopsy samples obtained before starting Atezo + Bev to clarify the mechanism of resistance to Atezo + Bev in patients with advanced HCC. Methods: This study enrolled patients with advanced HCC treated with Atezo + Bev at Chiba University Hospital between October 2020 and April 2021. We defined an ineffective group as patients with PD within 2 months according to RECIST version 1.1. The analysis of the tumor microenvironment in this study was performed using the nCounter PanCancer IO 360TM Panel. Results: Of 56 patients who initiated Atezo + Bev during the study period, biopsy samples with a sufficient amount of tumor tissue for analysis were obtained from 30 patients by percutaneous needle biopsy immediately before administering Atezo + Bev. According to radiological assessments, 7 and 23 patients were classified as ineffective and effective groups, respectively. Comparing baseline characteristics of the two groups, the rate ofalpha fetoprotein (AFP) ≥ 400 ng/mL was significantly higher in the ineffective group (ineffective group: 85.7%; effective group: 34.8%; p = 0.031). According to gene expression analyses, 101 of 775 genes were differentially expressed between the two groups. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that antigen presentation, cytokine and chemokine signaling, cytotoxicity, immune cell adhesion and migration, and interferon signaling had a lower expression in the ineffective group. Conversely, a higher expression of cell proliferation signaling was observed in the ineffective group. In this cohort, the expression of Wnt signaling showed no significant difference between the two groups. We calculated the cytolytic activity based on the expression of granzyme A and perforin 1, and it was significantly lower in the ineffective group (6.1 in the effective group and 5.3 in the ineffective group, p = 0.013). Conclusions: Analysis of the tumor microenvironment found differences of several gene expressions and those of signaling between the ineffective and effective groups of Atezo + Bev in patients with advanced HCC. The ineffectiveness of Atezo + Bev is due to the reduced action of T cell infiltration and its immune response to tumor.",,,,L637296681,10.1200/JCO.2022.40.4_suppl.468

HIMALAYA (NCT03298451) evaluated the efficacy and safety of STRIDE or D vs sorafenib (S) in uHCC. Methods: HIMALAYA is an open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study, in which pts with uHCC and no prior systemic therapy were initially randomized to STRIDE (T 300 mg plus D 1500 mg [one dose] plus D 1500 mg every 4 weeks [Q4W]), D (1500 mg Q4W), S (400 mg twice daily), or T 75 mg Q4W (4 doses) plus D 1500 mg Q4W (T75+D). Recruitment to T75+D ceased after a planned analysis of Study 22 showed T75+D did not meaningfully differ from D. The primary objective was overall survival (OS) for STRIDE vs S. The secondary objective was OS noninferiority (NI) of D to S (NI margin: 1.08). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR; RECIST v.1.1), duration of response (DoR), and safety. Results: In total, 1171 pts were randomized to STRIDE (N=393), D (N=389), or S (N=389). At data cutoff (DCO), the primary objective was met: OS was significantly improved for STRIDE vs S (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 96% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.92; p=0.0035; Table). D met the objective of OS NI to S (HR, 0.86; 96% CI, 0.73-1.03). ORRs were higher for STRIDE (20.1%) and D (17.0%) than for S (5.1%). No new safety signals were identified. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 25.8% (STRIDE), 12.9% (D), and 36.9% (S) of pts. Grade 3/4 hepatic TRAEs occurred in 5.9% (STRIDE), 5.2% (D), and 4.5% (S) of pts. No TRAE of esophageal varices hemorrhage occurred. Rates of TRAEs leading to discontinuation were 8.2% (STRIDE), 4.1% (D), and 11.0% (S). Conclusions: HIMALAYA was the first large phase 3 trial with a diverse, representative uHCC population and extensive long-term follow-up to assess both mono- and combination immunotherapy. D was noninferior to S with favorable safety. The combination of a single priming dose of T plus D in STRIDE displayed superior efficacy and a favorable benefit-risk profile vs S.

This clinically meaningful tx benefit was maintained with an additional 12 months of follow-up (Finn ASCO GI 2021). We report the efficacy and safety in pts who received atezo beyond radiological progression until loss of clinical benefit. Methods: Pts were randomized 2:1 to receive atezo 1,200 mg IV + bev 15 mg/kg IV q3w or sor 400 mg bid until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit per investigator (INV). In the presence of clinical benefit, pts with progressive disease (PD) per INV RECIST 1.1 (not at a critical anatomical site) could continue study tx. Pts from the atezo + bev arm who had PD and continued atezo were included. Results: Of the 336 pts who received atezo + bev, 236 had PD, of whom 130 continued atezo (± bev), 60 had other tx, and 46 received no tx on or after first PD. Of the pts who continued atezo, 78% were Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C and 80% Child-Pugh A5 vs pts receiving other tx (85% BCLC stage C, 72% ChildPugh A5). Sor (13% and 53%) and lenvatinib (14% and 35%) were the most common other txs received post PD among pts who continued atezo or received other tx, respectively. At clinical cutoff (August 31, 2020), the mediannumber of cycles of atezo received post PD was 5 (range, 1-33) and 41 (32%) pts received ≥ 10 cycles. 60 of 130 (46%) pts who continued atezo died vs 180 of 336 (54%) receiving atezo + bev in the ITT population. See Table for efficacy data from baseline (BL) and PD. Grade (Gr) 3/4 and tx-related Gr 3/4 AEs occurred in 30 (23%) and 21 (16%) pts who continued atezo, respectively. There were 6 (5%) Gr 5 AEs, none tx-related. Conclusions: Atezo + bev is the standard of care for pts with unresectable HCC. In IMbrave150, pts with maintained clinical benefit continuing atezo after PD may have further benefited from staying on tx, although interpretation is limited by selection bias (prespecified criteria excluding pts with loss of clinical benefit). These data suggest that tx with atezo until loss of clinical benefit may contribute to post-PD outcomes. Beyond this exploratory analysis in select pts, the value of tx with atezo beyond formal progression will be assessed prospectively in IMbrave251 (NCT04770896).",,,,L637296733,10.1200/JCO.2022.40.4_suppl.470

Methods: Patients with advanced HCC were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lenvatinib plus TACE (LEN-TACE group) or lenvatinib alone (LEN group). Randomized stratification factors include: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score (0 vs. 1), tumor thrombus (presence vs. absence), body weight (<60 vs. ≥60kg) and site. In both Len group and LENTACE group, patients received oral lenvatinib after randomization within 3 days. The initial dose is 12 mg/day for patients weighing ≥ 60 kg, and 8 mg/day for patients weighing < 60 kg. TACE was started one day after initial lenvatinib in LEN-TACE group and then performed ondemand according to the condition of the tumor and liver function. The primary endpoint were overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR, the proportion of patients with complete response or partial response according to mRECIST), and adverse events. The deadline for interim analysis of data is September 20, 2021. Results: Overall, 338 patients from 12 hospital in China were randomly assigned to receive either lenvatinib plus TACE (n = 170) or lenvatinib (n = 168). The median follow-up duration was 18.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.7-23.1 months) in the LEN-TACE group and 17.0 months (95% CI 14.2-19.8 months) in the LEN group. The median OS was 17.8 months (95% CI 16.1-19.5) for the lenvatinib-TACE group and 11.5 months (95% CI 10.3-12.7) for the lenvatinib group (stratified hazard ratio [HR] for death = 0.45, 95% CI 0.33- 0.61, P<0.001).

First-line treatment options for patients with advanced disease previously included tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have resulted in a median overall survival (OS) of less than a year. Combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR) inhibitors are of interest given the known effects of VEGF in the tumor microenvironment, including promoting inhibitory immune cells, suppressing maturation of dendritic cells, decreasing cytotoxic T cell responses, and altering lymphocyte development and trafficking. The phase III IMbrave150 trial investigated the combination of atezolizumab (A) and bevacizumab (B) as compared to sorafenib (S) in previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic HCC patients, and resulted in significantly improved OS (mOS: 19.2 mos AB vs 13.4 mos S), PFS (mPFS: 6.9 mos AB vs 4.3 mos S), and response rates (ORR: 29.8% AB vs 11.3% S), and a meaningful improvement in duration of response (mDOR: 18.1 mos AB vs 14.9 mos S). Notably, patients with class Child-Pugh B liver dysfunction were excluded from this study, although they are clinically abundant. We hypothesize the combination of AB will be safe and well tolerated in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HCC with Child-Pugh class B7 liver dysfunction. In addition, we expect efficacy will be similar to that demonstrated by the IMbrave150 study, and that ctDNA will correlate with, and possibly predict, clinical outcomes. Methods: This will be a single arm phase II study investigating the safety of the combination of AB in patients with previouslyuntreated locally advanced or metastatic HCC with Child-Pugh B7 liver dysfunction.

At IA2, pembro significantly improved PFS (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60-0.92, P = 0.0032) and ORR (estimated difference 11.4%, 95% CI 6.7-16.0, P = 0.00004); median (95% CI) PFS was 2.6 mo (1.5- 2.8) for pembro vs 2.3 mo (1.4-2.8) for placebo, 12-mo PFS rates were 15.9% vs 1.4%, and ORR was 12.7% vs 1.3%. At FA, ORR was 13.7% vs 1.3%, median DOR was 23.9 mo vs 5.6 mo, DCR was 52.7% vs 47.7%, and median TTP was 2.7 mo vs 1.7 mo (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58-0.90). At FA, treatment-related AEs occurred in 66.9% of pts in the pembro arm and 49.7% in the placebo arm, including 14.4% and 5.9% with grade 3-5 events. 3 pts (1.0%) in the pembro arm and 0 in the placebo arm died of treatment-related AEs. Conclusions: Pembro plus BSC significantly improved OS, PFS, and ORR compared with placebo plus BSC as second-line therapy for patients from Asia with advanced HCC. The pembro safety profile was as expected. Overall, results were consistent with those previously observed in KEYNOTE-224 and KEYNOTE-240 and thus add to the body of evidence supporting the use of pembro as second-line therapy for advanced HCC.",,,,L637296804,10.1200/jco.2022.40.4_suppl.383

Toripalimab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1, has already been approved for melanoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma in China. Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of toripalimab plus bevacizumab as a first-line treatment for unresectable HCC. Methods: This is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, phase II study. Patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HCC, BCLC stage C or B, Child-Pugh stage A, ECOG PS ≤ 1, at least one measurable lesion, no prior systemic therapy, were enrolled and treated with toripalimab (240mg, IV, D1) plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, IV, D1) every 3 weeks as first-line treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. The primary endpoints were tolerability and objective response rate (ORR, per RECIST 1.1 by investigators). The secondary endpoints included the ORR (per mRECIST by independent review committee), the disease control rate (DCR) and progressive free survival (PFS), DoR, time-to-progression (TTP), time-to-response (TTR) and OS. Tumor response was assessed every 6 weeks. Results: As the data cut-off dateofJune 23, 2021,54 pts were enrolled (males 48; median age 54 years [range 26-68]; ECOG PS 0-1; 87.0% with HBV infection; 74.1% in BCLC stage C; 74.1% had received previous local treatment). All pts received at least one cycle of toripalimab plus bevacizumab treatment with median cycles 10 [range 1-18]. Among 52 evaluable patients, per RECIST v1.1, ORR was 32.7% (17/52) with 1 CR and 16 PR, and DCR was 78.8% (41/52); per mRECIST, ORR was 46.2% (95% CI: 32.2-60.5%) and DCR was 94.2% (95% CI: 84.1-98.8%). The median PFS was 9.9 months (95%CI: 5.5-11.0) and median OS has not reached. Most treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) were grade 1-2. Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 25.9% pts, SAEs occurred in 27.8% pts, and grade ≥3 irAEs occurred in 11.1% pts. No treatmentemergent adverse event (TEAE) leading to death occurred in the study. Conclusions: Toripalimab in combination with bevacizumab as first-line treatment showed promising antitumor activity in patients with advanced HCC, and a manageable safety profile.

Date of Publication: 1 Feb 2022","2022","40","4 SUPPL",,,"1 Feb 2022","Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most common and deadliest cancers worldwide. In the intermediate stage the current standard of care is locoregional treatment with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). The IMbrave150 phase 3 study has demonstrated that the combination of atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, and bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody (atezo/bev), extends survival in comparison to sorafenib in the first-line setting in advanced HCC[1] which has led to its approval for patients with unresectable HCC. However, it is unknown whether atezo/bev is more efficacious than TACE for the treatment of intermediate HCC. ABC-HCC (NCT04803994) is a phase 3b, randomized, multicenter, open-label, investigator-initiated trial of atezo/bev versus TACE in intermediate stage HCC with high tumor burden exceeding the Milan criteria. Methods: The ABC-HCC study is recruiting patients ≥18 years of age who have a confirmed diagnosis of HCC in the intermediate stage (multifocal, exceeding the Milan criteria, no extrahepatic spread, no macrovascular invasion) and no curative treatment option. In addition, patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0, preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A), and ≥2 untreated lesions with a diameter > 10 mm and arterial hyperenhancement on cross-sectional imaging. Those who have previously received locoregional or systemic treatment are excluded. 434 patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to systemic treatment (atezo at 1200 mg IV plus bev at 15 mg/kg IV) once every three weeks or to TACE. Both conventional and DEB-TACE are allowed. Region, AFP level (< 200 ng/mL vs. ≥200 ng/mL), and ALBI (1 vs. 2) will be used for stratification. Cross-sectional imaging (CT/MRI) will be performed every 8 weeks to determine the time to failure of treatment strategy, a novel primary endpoint. Failure of strategy is reached in case of progressive disease and any of the following: loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, liver function deterioration, and therapy not further applicable for other reasons. Secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS), OS rate at 24 months, objective response rate, time to progression, time to loss of systemic treatment options, progression-free survival, duration of treatment, duration of response, time to deterioration of liver function, safety, and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 and HCC18). Patients will be followed for survival, quality of life and subsequent anti-cancer therapy every 12 weeks after the end of study treatment. Recruitment for this study began in July 2021.

Date of Publication: 1 Feb 2022","2022","40","4 SUPPL",,,"1 Feb 2022","Background: The phase 2 Study 22 trial (NCT02519348) investigated durvalumab (antiprogrammed cell death ligand-1 [PD-L1] antibody) and tremelimumab (anti-cytotoxic Tlymphocyte associated antigen 4 antibody) as monotherapy, or durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab or bevacizumab (antivascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] antibody), for the treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). Results of Study 22 that evaluated durvalumab and tremelimumab as monotherapy or in combination were reported previously. PD-L1 inhibition plus VEGF inhibition with bevacizumab may exhibit an additive effect to improve clinical activity. Herein, we report results from a single-arm cohort of Study 22, evaluating durvalumab plus bevacizumab as first-line treatment in patients with uHCC. Methods: Patients with uHCC who had not received any prior systemic therapy were administered durvalumab 1120 mg plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. Adequate endoscopic therapy according to institutional standards was required for patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding for >12 months or those at high risk for esophageal varices. The primary endpoint was safety. Secondary endpoints included confirmed objective response rate (ORR; assessed by blinded independent central review [BICR] according to RECIST v1.1), duration of response (DoR; RECIST v1.1 by BICR) and overall survival (OS). Results: At the data cut-off (November 6, 2020), 47 patients were allocated to receive treatment. Median total treatment duration was 6.2 months (durvalumab) and 4.1 months (bevacizumab). Thirty-three (70.2%) patients experienced an adverse event possibly related to treatment (TRAE). Grade 3 or 4 TRAEs occurred in 4 (8.5%) patients; serious TRAEs occurred in 5 (10.6%) patients, including gastric ulcer perforation, ascites, and liver tumor rupture, possibly related to bevacizumab, and raised creatinine and pneumonitis, possibly related to durvalumab. There were 3 (6.4%) discontinuations and no deaths associated with TRAEs. Objective responses (RECIST 1.1 by BICR) were confirmed in 10 patients (ORR, 21.3%; 95% CI, 10.7-35.7); median DoR (RECIST 1.1 by BICR) was not reached.

Methods: This is a multicenter phase 1 study of NIVO and deb-TACE in unresectable HCC pts and Child Pugh A cirrhosis (NCT03143270). The primary objective is to assess safety. Secondary objectives include response rate by RECIST v1.1, progression-free and overall survival by KaplanMeier methodology, and blood/tumor immune correlates. A 3 + 3 design with expansion cohort sequentially evaluates 3 cohorts of differing schedules of NIVO relative to deb-TACE. DebTACE (75mg of doxorubicin) is administered on Day 0. NIVO is dosed at 240mg IV every 14 days for 1 year (Cohort 1: NIVO begins day +14 after deb-TACE; Cohort 2, interrupted NIVO dosing begins at Day -28 but is held on the Day 0 then restarted on Day +14; Cohort 3, continuous NIVO dosing begins on Day -28 without interruption). Results: As of September 2021, 19 pts were treated [median 67 years (range: 54- 78), male (80%), ECOG PS 0 (47%), Child Pugh A (100%), 3 pts in each cohort 1 and 2, 13 pts in cohort 3]. No cases of treatment related liver failure or Grade 5 adverse events (AEs) were observed. 1 DLT of Grade 3 transaminitis was observed in cohort 3 and resolved without intervention and did not recur with drug rechallenge. Median ALT at baseline, day 28, day 56, and end of treatment (EOT) were 27, 43.5, 36.5, and 29 U/L. Median bilirubin at baseline, day 28, day 56, and EOT were 0.6, 0.6, 0.5, and 0.6 mg/dL. Mean ALBI score at baseline (N=19) and EOT (N=14) were -2.75 ± 0.48 vs. -2.55 ± 0.50. The most common treatment-related AEs of any grade were fatigue (53%), ALT/AST increase (42%), fever (37%), and pruritis (32%).

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Ate/Bev in Child-Pugh B HCC patients. Methods: This multicenter retrospective study included 27 HCC patients classified as Child-Pugh B who received Ate/Bev at four cancer referral centers between May 2020 and August 2021. Comparative analyses were performed with an independent cohort of Child-Pugh A patients from the same registry (n=130). Results: All patients received Ate/Bev as first-line systemic treatment for aHCC. The objective response rates of patients in Child-Pugh groups B and A were 14.8% and 32.3%, and the disease control rates were 55.5% and 76.1%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.0 months (95% CI, 1.6-4.3) and 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.9-7.0) in Child-Pugh B patients, while the median PFS was 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.6-13.4) and the median OS was not-reached (95% CI not available) in Child-Pugh A group. Compared to Child-Pugh A group, grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) were more common in the Child-Pugh B group (48.1% vs 17.7%, p=0.001), with the most frequent grade 3-4 AEs being thrombocytopenia (11.1%) and AST elevation (11.1%).

This approach results in F8 or F9 gene delivery to the liver using a single intravenous infusion to produce FVIII or FIX expression. The longest reported follow-up in clinical studies is at 5 (haemophilia A) and 8 (haemophilia B) years, with ongoing FVIII or FIX expression and reduction in bleeding episodes. There are however questions surrounding variability in response and the long-term durability of this treatment modality. Focusing on safety, this can be divided into three phases: immediate, early (months) and long-term. Although infusion reactions have been reported in a small number of participants these have generally been mild. The predominant adverse event described has been elevations in liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, ALT), which in some cases has been assigned to activation of a cytotoxic T-cell immune response. In view of loss of vector expression that has occurred with this reaction, studies have incorporated immunosuppressive mitigation strategies to preserve transgene expression. The predominant long-term safety considerations relate to liver health and whether there is a potential for vector integration that might result in genotoxicity. Data on AAV vector persistence has been presented a decade after vector delivery in the severe haemophilia A dog model. This has confirmed that although AAV predominantly persist as episomal (non-integrating) forms, that integration does occur at low frequency, without evidence of liver disease or tumour formation. Although, long-term data in clinical studies is currently limited, no adverse liver safety signals have been reported during follow up in the phase 1/2 studies. Recently presented molecular studies from a case of hepatocellular carcinoma in a participant within one of the phase 3 haemophilia B studies, demonstrated that this was unlikely to be related to AAV-FIX treatment. There are four phase-3 studies currently ongoing and it is anticipated that licensing approvals will be seen in the near future for the first AAV based approach for treatment of haemophilia.

Methods: Adult male participants (n = 54) with severe or moderately severe HB (FIX ≤2%), with (n = 31) or without (n = 23) pre-existing AAV5 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), were treated in the Phase 3, open-label, single-dose, single-arm, HOPE-B trial (NCT03569891) with 2 × 10(13) gc/kg etranacogene dezaparvovec, following a ≥6-month lead-in period of FIX prophylaxis. FIX activity, annualized bleed rate (ABR), and FIX infusions were assessed over a uniform ≥52-week period after achieving stable FIX expression, designated as Months 7-18 after vector infusion to serve as the basis for regulatory approval. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Results: Mean FIX activity was 39.0 IU/dL (±18.7; 8.2, 97.1) (standard deviation; min, max) at Month 6 and 36.9 IU/dL (±21.4; 4.5, 122.9) at Month 18. Individual participant FIX activity and titer of pre-existing AAV5 NAbs (present in 23 participants) did not correlate up to a titer of 678; one participant with NAbs = 3212 did not express FIX Padua. Compared with the ≥6-month lead-in period (ABR 4.19), 52-week adjusted ABR for all bleeds during Months 7-18 (ABR 1.51) was reduced by 64% (p = 0.0002), demonstrating statistical superiority over FIX prophylaxis. FIX-treated bleeds were reduced by 77% (from ABR 3.65 to 0.83; p<0.0001). 52/53 (98%) participants who received a full dose discontinued prophylaxis, with an overall 97% reduction in mean unadjusted annualized FIX consumption (from lead-in period 257338.8 to Months 13-18 8486.6 IU/yr/participant). After dosing, 37 participants experienced 92 treatment-related AEs, of which 74 (80.4%) were mild. A serious AE of hepatocellular carcinoma was determined by independent molecular tumor characterization and vector integration analysis to be unrelated to vector.

However, the choice of the second-line treatment after the failure of immunotherapy-based first-line remains elusive. Taking into account the weaknesses of the available evidence, we developed a simulation model based on available phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to identify optimal risk/benefit sequential strategies. Methods: A Markov model was built to estimate the overall survival (OS) of sequential first- and second-line systemic treatments. Sequences starting with first-line ATEZO plus BEVA followed by 5 second-line treatments (sorafenib [SORA], lenvatinib [LENVA], regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab) were compared. The probability of transition between states (initial treatment, cancer progression, and death) was derived from RCTs. Life-year gained (LYG) was the main outcome. Rates of severe adverse events (SAEs) (≥ grade 3) were calculated. The incremental safety-effectiveness ratio (ISER) was calculated as the difference in probability of SAEs divided by LYG between the 2 most effective sequences. Results: ATEZO plus BEVA followed by LENVA (median OS, 24 months) or SORA (median OS, 23 months) was the most effective sequence, producing a LYG of 0.50 and 0.42 year, respectively. ATEZO plus BEVA followed by SORA was the safest sequence (SAEs 63%). At a willingness-to-risk threshold of 10% of SAEs for LYG, ATEZO plus BEVA followed by second-line SORA was favored in 72% of cases, while at a threshold of 30% of SAEs for LYG, ATEZO plus BEVA followed by second-line LENVA was favored in 69% of cases. Conclusion: Our simulation model provides a strong rationale to support ongoing trials evaluating second-line tyrosine-kinase inhibitors after first-line ATEZO plus BEVA.

We aimed to compare the overall survival of patients treated with FOLFOX-HAIC versus TACE as first-line treatment in this population. METHODS In this randomized, multicenter, open-label trial, adults with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (largest diameter ≥ 7 cm) without macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread were randomly assigned 1:1 to FOLFOX-HAIC (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2), leucovorin 400 mg/m(2), fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m(2) on day 1, and fluorouracil infusion 2,400 mg/m(2) for 24 hours, once every 3 weeks) or TACE (epirubicin 50 mg, lobaplatin 50 mg, and lipiodol and polyvinyl alcohol particles). The primary end point was overall survival by intention-to-treat analysis. Safety was assessed in patients who received ≥ 1 cycle of study treatment. RESULTS Between October 1, 2016, and November 23, 2018, 315 patients were randomly assigned to FOLFOX-HAIC (n = 159) or TACE (n = 156). The median overall survival in the FOLFOX-HAIC group was 23.1 months (95% CI, 18.5 to 27.7) versus 16.1 months (95% CI, 14.3 to 17.9) in the TACE group (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.75; P <.001). The FOLFOX-HAIC group showed a higher response rate than the TACE group (73 [46%] v 28 [18%]; P <.001) and a longer median progression-free survival (9.6 [95% CI, 7.4 to 11.9] v 5.4 months [95% CI, 3.8 to 7.0], P <.001). The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the TACE group than in the FOLFOX-HAIC group (30% v 19%, P =.03). Two deaths in the FOLFOX-HAIC group and two in the TACE group were deemed to be treatment-related. CONCLUSION FOLFOX-HAIC significantly improved overall survival over TACE in patients with unresectable large hepatocellular carcinoma.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02973685)",,34648352,L2020873817,10.1200/JCO.21.00608

In this exploratory analysis, outcomes were evaluated according to plasma biomarker levels. Methods: Baseline plasma levels were evaluated for MET, AXL, VEGFR2, HGF, GAS6, VEGF-A, PlGF, IL-8, EPO, ANG2, IGF-1, VEGF-C, and c-KIT for 674/707 randomized patients; and Week 4 levels were evaluated for MET, AXL, VEGFR2, HGF, GAS6, VEGF-A, PlGF, IL-8, and EPO for 614 patients. OS and PFS were analyzed by baseline levels as dichotomized or continuous variables and by on-treatment changes at Week 4 as continuous variables; biomarkers were considered potentially prognostic if p < 0.05 and predictive if p < 0.05 for the interaction between treatment and the biomarker. Multivariable analyses adjusting for clinical covariates were also performed. Results: In the placebo group, high levels of MET, HGF, GAS6, IL-8, and ANG2 and low levels of IGF-1 were associated with shorter OS in univariate and multivariable analyses; these associations were also observed for MET, IL-8, and ANG2 in the cabozantinib group. Hazard ratios for OS and PFS favored cabozantinib over the placebo at low and high baseline levels for all biomarkers. No baseline biomarkers were predictive of a treatment benefit. Cabozantinib promoted pharmacodynamic changes in several biomarkers, including increases in VEGF-A, PlGF, AXL, and GAS6 levels and decreases in VEGFR2 and HGF levels; these changes were not associated with OS or PFS. Conclusion: Cabozantinib improved OS and PFS versus placebo at high and low baseline concentrations for all biomarkers analyzed. Low baseline levels of MET, HGF, GAS6, IL-8, and ANG2 and high levels of IGF-1 were identified as potential favorable prognostic biomarkers for survival in previously treated advanced HCC. Although cabozantinib promoted pharmacodynamic changes in several biomarkers, these changes were not associated with survival.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01908426)",,,L2015945958,10.1159/000519867

The therapeutic options for the main types of primary liver cancer—hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)—are very limited. HCC and CCA are immunogenic cancers, but effective immune-mediated tumour control is prevented by their immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. Despite the critical involvement of key co-inhibitory immune checkpoint interactions in immunosuppression in liver cancer, only a minority of patients with HCC respond to monotherapy using approved checkpoint inhibitor antibodies. To develop effective (combinatorial) therapeutic immune checkpoint strategies for liver cancer, in-depth knowledge of the different mechanisms that contribute to intratumoral immunosuppression is needed. Here, we review the co-inhibitory pathways that are known to suppress intratumoral T cells in HCC and CCA. We provide a detailed description of insights from preclinical studies in cellular crosstalk within the tumour microenvironment that results in interactions between co-inhibitory receptors on different T-cell subsets and their ligands on other cell types, including tumour cells. We suggest alternative immune checkpoints as promising targets, and draw attention to the possibility of combined targeting of co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory pathways to abrogate immunosuppression.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01658878, NCT01853618, NCT02476123, NCT02572687, NCT02715531, NCT02923934, NCT02942329, NCT03006926, NCT03046862, NCT03298451, NCT03434379, NCT03478488, NCT03605706, NCT03713593, NCT03755791, NCT03764293, NCT03778957, NCT03847428, NCT04003636, NCT04039607, NCT04102098, NCT04167293, NCT04246177, NCT04340193, NCT04523493, NCT04669496)",,34400801,L2013462333,10.1038/s41416-021-01453-3

Notwithstanding, treatment efficacy is low, with few patients obtaining long-lasting benefits due to the high chemoresistance rate. Objective: To perform, for the first time, an overview of the literature concerning the role of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in sorafenib therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Three online databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched, from inception to October 2020. Study selection, analysis, and data collection were independently performed by two authors. Results: The search yielded 224 results; 29 were selected for inclusion. Most studies were pre-clinical, using HCC cell lines; three used human samples. Studies highlight the effect of sorafenib in decreasing ABC transporters expression. Conversely, it is described the role of ABC transporters, particularly multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR-1), multidrug resistance-associated proteins 1 and 2 (MRP-1 and MRP-2) and ABC subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) in sorafenib pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, being key resistance factors. Combination therapy with naturally available or synthetic compounds that modulate ABC transporters may revert sorafenib resistance by increasing absorption and intracellular concentration.

The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (1 [<1%] of 367 patients in the nivolumab group vs 52 [14%] of patients in the sorafenib group), aspartate aminotransferase increase (22 [6%] vs 13 [4%]), and hypertension (0 vs 26 [7%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in 43 (12%) patients receiving nivolumab and 39 (11%) patients receiving sorafenib. Four deaths in the nivolumab group and one death in the sorafenib group were assessed as treatment related. Interpretation: First-line nivolumab treatment did not significantly improve overall survival compared with sorafenib, but clinical activity and a favourable safety profile were observed in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, nivolumab might be considered a therapeutic option for patients in whom tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antiangiogenic drugs are contraindicated or have substantial risks.

However, in the last few years, immunotherapy-based combinations have emerged as efficacious therapeutic strategy in this setting. This paper critically summarizes the recent therapeutic progress in the systemic treatment of HCC. Area covered: This paper examines the preclinical rationale of the following combinations in HCC: dual checkpoint inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors plus anti-angiogenic agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors plus tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Results of recent clinical studies are presented, along with a brief overview of ongoing and future trials. Expert opinion: The approval of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and the positive results of the HIMALAYA trial have broadened the therapeutic scenario for advanced HCC, opening, at the same time, new challenges. First of all, predictive biomarkers to allocate patients to the best treatment are eagerly required; second, specific studies are urgently needed to define the use of new combinations in patients usually excluded from clinical trials, e.g. those with deranged liver function and HIV or transplant recipients.

Methods: A partition survival model adapted to the French setting was used to estimate clinical outcomes and costs of ATZ+BVA versus sorafenib over a 15 years’ time horizon. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 2,5%. Parametric functions of both treatment were fitted to the phase III IMbrave150 trial data regarding progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and Time To Off Treatment (TTOT). Health state utilities were estimated from the IMbrave150 trial using EQ-5D-5L with French tariff to apply French preference scores. Costs were calculated from a collective perspective. Probabilistic, deterministic and scenario analyses were run to explore parameter uncertainty. Results: Compared to sorafenib, the therapeutic combination ATZ+BVA was associated with a gain of 0.69 Life Years (LY), 0.6 (1.95 vs 1.35) Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) and an incremental cost of €87 359 (€124 838 vs. €37 478) resulting in an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of 144 126€/QALY. Conclusions: The results of this model with an additional 12 month follow-up confirms that ATZ+BVA could be a cost-effective strategy considering the value for QALY proposed by Tehard et al.

Methods: This is a retrospective study including 772 HCC clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov and 1784 HCC patients receiving antiviral treatment. The Kaplan–Meier (K-M) method was used to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between different groups, and Cox regression analyses were performed to validate possible risk factors on PFS and overall survival OS. Results: Among 772 clinical trials, 58.3% did not adopt baseline HBV loads as exclusion criteria, 18.0% was 2000 IU/mL, and 10.5% was receiving antiviral therapy. We observed baseline HBV loads had no significant impact on PFS (p = 0.491, 0.155, 0.119, 0.788, 0.280, 0.683 respectively) and OS (p = 0.478, 0.741, 0.263, 0.039, 0.999, 0.581 respectively) in all patients or each treatment group including hepatectomy, radiofrequency ablation, interventional therapy, targeted drugs and anti-programmed cell death immunotherapy, except for the OS of interventional therapy group, where patients with high HBV loads had higher BCLC stage, serum AFP level and ALBI grade (p = 0.009, 0.015 and 0.003, respectively).

Date of Publication: 2022","2022","9",,"1011","1027","2022","Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) management has become more complex as novel therapies have been proven effective. After sorafenib, the approval of other multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) and immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICIs) has considerably increased the number of systemic therapies available. Therefore, careful assessment and monitoring of response to systemic treatment are essential to identify surrogate endpoints of overall survival (OS) in clinical trials and reliable tools to gauge treatment benefit in clinical practice. Progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) are early informative parameters of efficacy that are not influenced by further lines of therapy. However, none of them has shown sufficient surrogacy to be recommended in place of OS in phase 3 trials. With such a wealth of therapeutic options, the prime intent of tumor assessments is no longer limited to identifying progressive disease to spare ineffective treatments to non-responders. Indeed, the early detection of responders could also help tailor treatment sequencing. Tumor assessment relies on the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST), which are easy to interpret – being based on dimensional principles – but could misread the activity of targeted agents. The HCC-specific modified RECIST (mRECIST), considering both the MKI-induced biological modifications and some of the cirrhosis-induced liver changes, better capture tumor response. Yet, mRECIST could not be considered a standard in advanced HCC. Further prognosticators including progression patterns, baseline and on-treatment liver function deterioration, and baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and AFP response have been extensively evaluated for MKIs. However, limited information is available for patients receiving ICIs and regarding their predictive role. Finally, there is increasing interest in incorporating novel imaging techniques which go beyond sizes and novel serum biomarkers in the advanced HCC framework. Hopefully, multiparametric models grouping dimensional and functional radiological parameters with biochemical markers will most precisely reflect treatment response.",,,,L2018013233,10.2147/JHC.S268293

Methods: This PMS was conducted as a multi-center, prospective, observational study at 34 centers in Korea from August 2013 to August 2019. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of regorafenib in real-world practice, with the secondary objective to investigate its effectiveness, including its overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: In total, 301 patients were included in the analysis (254 patients with CRC, 14 patients with GIST, and 33 patients with HCC). The incidence rates of adverse events (AEs) were 85.0%, 78.6%, and 81.8% in patients with CRC, GIST, and HCC, respectively. The most frequent AE related to regorafenib in the three cancer types was palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES). The ORRs of patients with CRC, GIST, and HCC were 4.7%, 0%, and 41.4%, respectively. The median PFS and OS were 2.1 and 6.1 months for CRC, respectively; 9.2 and 16.4 months for GIST, respectively; and 5.5 months and not estimated (NE) for HCC, respectively. Patients who experienced a dose modification or discontinuation of regorafenib showed significantly shorter median PFS and OS (2.2 vs. 2.6 months, respectively, P = 0.0335 for PFS; 5.3 vs. 8.5 months, respectively, P = 0.0010 for OS). Conclusion: This PMS study, which is the largest surveillance study of CRC in Korea, found no newly identified safety concerns for patients who received regorafenib in the real-world setting.

We hypothesized that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) derived scores may provide improved survival prediction over CTP classification. This study aimed to evaluate the potential prognostic and predictive effects of IGF-1 derived scores in the phase III IMbrave150 study. Patients and Methods: Baseline and on-treatment serum IGF-1 levels from 371 patients were subjected to central analysis. Patients’ IGF-1 score (1/2/3) and IGF-CTP score (A/B/C) were determined based on pre-specified cutoffs. Outcomes were analyzed by baseline and by on-treatment changes of the IGF-1 and IGF-CTP scores within and between the two treatment arms. The interaction between these scores and outcomes was assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Baseline IGF-CTP score (A vs B/C) showed prognostic significance for OS in both the atezolizumab-bevacizumab (hazard ratio [HR], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20–0.56; P<0.001) and sorafenib (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16–0.65; P=0.002) arms. Baseline IGF-1 score (1 vs 2/3) also showed prognostic significance for OS in both the atezolizumab-bevacizumab (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20–0.55; P<0.001) and sorafenib (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26–0.89; P=0.02) arms. HRs for PFS were consistent with those for OS. No significant predictive effects were observed for either score between the two arms. Kinetic analysis revealed that patients with increased IGF-1 score (1-> 2/3) at 3 weeks post treatment had shorter OS than patients with stable IGF-1 score of 1 in both the atezolizumab-bevacizumab (HR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.56–8.77; P=0.003) and sorafenib (HR, 5.83; 95% CI, 1.88–18.12; P=0.0023) arms.

"CAN WE GET BETTER AT TREATING HEPATOCELLULAR CANCER?","Josipa F., Mirela Š.P., Ivana C., Luka P.","Libri Oncologici (2022) 50:SUPPL 1 (22-24). Date of Publication: 2022","2022","50","SUPPL 1","22","24","2022","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy and the third most lethal neoplasm in the world. The treatment approach is determined by the stage of the disease and the degree of liver damage. The objective of treatment in the early stages is to cure the patient completely. Hepatectomy and liver transplantation are recommended for these individuals, which also cures cirrhosis as a cause of HCC. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are advised in circumstances where surgical excision is not possible. Chemoembolization, radioembolization, or embolization are indicated in the intermediate stage. Sorafenib, which was approved in 2008 and demonstrated a 2.8- month increase in survival when compared to placebo, was the first drug to show effectiveness. There have been several phase III trials comparing sorafenib to other drugs, however, only the REFLECT study with lenvatinib found it to be non-inferior to sorafenib. As a result, in August 2018, lenvatinib was authorized as the first-line therapy for unresectable HCC. The IMbrave study, published in May 2020, proved the importance of immunotherapy as a first-line treatment for HCC. Finn et al found that the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab improved overall survival by 67.2 % in the atezolizumab and bevacizumab group, compared to 54.6 percent in the sorafenib group, and also showed that survival to disease progression was 6.8 months in the atezolizumab and bevacizumab group, compared to 4.3 months in the sorafenib group. As a result, in the first line of inoperable HCC, the combination of atezolizumab with bevacizumab has become the standard of therapy. HCC may be separated into two types based on the expression of immune biomarkers: non-inflammatory “cool” tumors, which account for 70% of all HCC, and inflammatory “warm” tumors, which represent about 30% of all HCC. Regorafenib was added after 9 years to the HCC drug list. A phase III RESORCE trial comparing regorafenib to placebo found a 7.8 to 10.6-month survival improvement. Regorafenib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved in second-line treatment that has been licensed for patients with a Child-Pugh score of A who have progressed on sorafenib. Cabozantinib, a treatment alternative to regorafenib, is also in the second-line treatment. It improved survival from 8 to 10.2 months in a CELESTIAL phase III trial, while progression-free survival (PFS) climbed to 5.2 months. The REACH study found that ramucirumab increased survival from 7.3 to 8.5 months and survival to disease progression from 1.6 to 2.8 months in individuals with AFP levels more than 400 ng/ml when compared to placebo. Ramucirumab in the second line was particularly effective for patients with ascites, whose overall survival improved from 3.4 to 6.7 months. Checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab, which have demonstrated encouraging outcomes in phase II trials, have been approved for second-line therapy of HHC patients. CheckMate 040 with nivolumab had a 15.6-month survival rate in patients who had previously undergone sorafenib. Unfortunately, no statistically meaningful results were found in phase III investigations. It's worth noting that checkpoint inhibitors have a response rate of less than 25%, and there have been reports of grade 3/4 severe effects. Pembrolizumab was authorized for second-line therapy of HCC after the Keynote- 224 trial. The FDA has also approved a combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in the second line. Dozens of new discoveries have pushed the frontiers of HCC patient care. The proper use of potential therapy modalities is a significant problem, and what we wish to achieve must include not just overall survival but also patient quality of life.",,,,L638201323,

Date of Publication: 2022","2022","50","SUPPL 1","82","83","2022","Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers represent a variety of malignancies, each with a unique interplay between the tumor and local immune microenvironment. The successes that immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibition, achieved in some other tumor types, has not yielded the same benefits to majority of GI-cancer-patients. Nevertheless, small subsets of cancers, such as DNA mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instable (MSI) cancers, among others, seem to benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibition. Routine testing for the rare molecular features that can predict response should be implemented in clinical routine for all GI tumors, and large scale clinical trials to identify predictive biomarkers are needed. It is now clear that some patients with GI-cancer are suitable for immunotherapy and as such, they change standard paradigms and guideline protocols known up to recent days. Various phase I-III trials focusing on immunotherapies for GI tumors have found only moderate to unsatisfactory objective response rates (ORR), ranging between 10 % and 25 %. The approval of several PD-1/ PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors radically changed the treatment landscape in many cancer types and established immune-oncology as a new treatment strategy against cancer. Several immunotherapies for the treatment of GI tumors have recently emerged; however, checkpoint inhibition has not yet shown similar success in GI malignancies compared to other solid tumors. Some of the recent data might be practice changing - the updated KEYNOTE-590 data lend greater weight for the use of pembrolizumab plus che motherapy as first-line standard of care in advanced esophageal cancer (includede squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and Siewert type 1 esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma, regardless of PDL1- status). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overal survival (OS) were superiro for CPS≥10 for combination treatment.(HR 0.59, 0,64, 0,73).A novel dual immunotherapy regimen significantly improved overall survival compared to a standard of care in patients with advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the large phase 3 HIMALAYA trial. The novel regimen, dubbed STRIDE (Single T Regular Interval D), comprised a single priming dose of the investigational agent tremelimumab followed by regular doses of durvalumab. Patients on this regimen experienced a 22% lower risk of death than patients treated with sorafenib, which at the time the trial began was the only approved frontline standard of care for patients with advanced HCC. Adding the checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab to chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer, as compared to chemotherapy alone, according to interim results from the TOPAZ-1 trial. According to results of TOPAZ-1, the risk of death for those taking durvalumab plus chemotherapy was 20% lower than for patients on chemotherapy alone. At 18 months, overall survival was 35.1% in the durvalumab group vs 25.6% for chemotherapy alone. By 2 years, overall survival was 24.9% vs 10.4%. TOPAZ-1 is the first phase 3 trial to show that adding immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy can increase survival in biliary tract cancer, and importantly, does so without inducing any new serious side effects. In the near future, innovative techniques with thoughtful treatment combinations, adoptive cell therapy, CAR-T cells, as well as novel predictive biomarkers are needed to bring the benefits of immunotherapy to the majority of patients with GI malignancies.",,,,L638201384,

More recent developments in oncology have offered renewed hope for advanced liver cancer patients. Hypofractionated radiation has shown feasibility and promise in unresectable setting, and is now being tested in a randomized phase III trial in HCC (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03186898). Antiangiogenic agents have strongly impacted the management of advanced HCC, with multiple drug options in first line setting (sorafenib, lenvatinib) and second line setting (regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab). Chemotherapy based regimens are standard of care in ICC and PDAC. Immunotherapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies has shown real potential to transform advanced HCC therapy, both in first line and second line settings. Finally, combinations of these new strategies are very attractive approaches, as they promise durable and profound responses in advanced HCC. But in order to achieve this promise more broadly, these concepts require greater understanding based on mechanistic preclinical studies and validation in correlative studies in clinical trials as a basis to establish optimal combinatorial strategies.

The key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with PLT ≥50×109/L on or after day 8 and within 2 days (the alternative criterion that does not require platelet transfusion) prior to the invasive procedure. Adverse events (AEs) were also recorded. Results: From July 2020 to June 2021, 66 patients were enrolled. Lusutrombopag had potent effect of platelet elevation and was well tolerated. All of the AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Only one patient in the lusutrombopag group reported thrombosis-related AEs (brachiocephalic vein thrombosis), which was mild and determined not related to the treatment. Three bleeding events in three patients occurred in the lusutrombopag group, and four bleeding events in three patients reported in the placebo group (6.8% vs. 13.6%). Conclusion: Lusutrombopag was effective in increasing PLT and avoiding preoperative platelet transfusion in Chinese patients with CLD-associated thrombocytopenia scheduled to undergo invasive procedures, with comparable safety profiles to placebo.",,,,L640339713,10.1159/000528570

Date of Publication: 2022","2022","11",,"14",,"2022","Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) accounting 5% of primary liver cancer has more invasive and metastatic biological behavior compared to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). ICC sometimes invades Glissonean pedicles, hepatic veins, or hepatic hilum. One third of surgical cases accompanies nodal metastasis. In the Japanese TNM-based staging of ICC, T factor includes 1) tumor number, 2) tumor size, and 3) vascular or biliary invasion. Solitary ICC involving the hepatic hilum with nodal metastasis can be estimated in Stage IVA, and 5-year survival rate of surgical patients with Stage IV ICC was 20% in Japanese national data. According to the treatment algorithm for ICC in the Japanese guideline published in 2020, surgical resection can be optimally indicated in patients with single nodular ICC without nodal metastasis. Surgical resection includes hepatectomy with/without biliary resection and nodal dissection. On the other hand, in patients with multiple ICCs with nodal metastasis or distant metastasis, systemic chemotherapy for biliary cancer is recommended. Systemic chemotherapy includes GC (Gem+Cis), GS (Gem+S-1), and GCS (Gem+Cis+S-1) therapy. Chromosomal translocations of FGFR2 can been found in 5-10% of ICC, thus pemigatinib, an anti-FGFR2 drug, might be an alternative anti-cancer drug. Radiation therapy can be an option for unresectable ICC. A Japanese randomized phase III trial of adjuvant therapy after surgical resection of biliary cancer (ASCOT trial, JCOG1202) revealed that survivals of patients undergoing adjuvant S-1 treatment for 6 months were significantly better than those of patients with surgery alone (3-yr survival 77.1% vs 67.6%, p=0.008, HR = 0.694), which was presented in ASCO-GI 2022.

"Locoregional treatment for HCC in the era of immunotherapy: Hype or hope?","Park J.-W.","Liver Cancer (2022) 11 Supplement 1 (17). Date of Publication: 2022","2022","11",,"17",,"2022","Newer systemic therapies, atezolzumba plus bevacizumab, and durvalumab plus tremelimumab, are expected to change traditional treatment strategies due to improved survival and reduced adverse events regimens. Systemic therapy has been recommended for patients who are expected to require repeated locoregional treatment, even for HCC localized in the liver, and for those who do not respond to repeated locoregional treatment. However, it is estimated that the indication and timing of these recommendations will change due to the advent of immunotherapeutic agents that are more effective and show fewer side effects. The advent of immunotherapeutic agents for HCC raises concerns not only about the indication of the first treatment but also about how to do secondary of subsequent treatment for immunotherapeutic responders. It is necessary to evaluate the strategy of applying locoregional treatment after immunotherapy or applying combination treatment with locoregional and systemic immunotherapy. However, there is no study comparing the new first-line treatment of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab with a combination therapy of locoregional treatment. We are waiting for the results of an ongoing phase 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus immunotherapy. Although the phase 3 RCT of combination therapy with TACE and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, brivanib) for patients with advanced HCC in the past has failed, there is hope for the combination therapy with TACE and immunotherapy. Among patients with advanced HCC, if the liver function is grade B or the risk of bleeding is high, it may be challenging to apply immunotherapy, so local treatment should be carefully considered. Although the currently available immunotherapeutic agents have improved overall survival and/or progression-free survival compared to the past, they are not satisfactory compared to the outcome of other cancers. As there are currently no biomarkers, it is considered that combination treatment or sequential treatment of locoregional treatment is necessary to improve the outcomes of patients with HCC.",,,,L640340337,10.1159/000528570

Date of Publication: 2022","2022","11",,"19",,"2022","Intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma comprised a very heterogeneous populations, these patients might not benefit from surgical treatments. Locoregional interventional therapies play a leading part in the management of HCC, and it is estimated that 50-60% of patients with HCC might receive those treatments in their lifespan. TACE has been recommended therapy for those patients. Median overall survival (mOS) were about 26-30 months in those patients with intermediate-stage HCC treated with TACE. However, in the past two decades, whether with the application of novel materials of embolization, such as drug-eluting beads or combination with molecular targeted drug, no improvement of OS was observed. How to improve outcomes of intermediate-stage HCC is one of the most important problems. The prognosis of HCC was affected by tumor burden, preserved liver function, performance status, etiology, etc. Even in recommended TACE candidates, OS is heterogenous. Scores proposed for patient selection and/or re- treatment with TACE have not yet been universally adopted. An easy-to-use individual method to predict the prognosis with high performance is needed. Systemic treatments with molecular and immune therapies have dramatically changed the management of cancer. the positive results of a phase III trial demonstrating superior results for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sorafenib for advanced HCC heralded a new era of combination therapies and set a new benchmark for survival benefits. Currently, RCTs are in progress with immunotherapy alone or combined with molecular therapy, either in combination with or directly challenging chemoembolization in intermediate- stage disease. Results of these trials will be public within the next 5 to 10 years. Although several therapeutic alternative transarterial devices (such as TARE) have challenged TACE, none of them has been able to substantially improve the standard of care established decades ago.

Recently, the efficacy of multiple MTAs, including lenvatinib, in practice has been reported, and therapeutic strategies for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) intermediate stage HCC are undergoing major changes. Based on these results, lenvatinib could be recommended for patients with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE)-refractory, ALBI grade 1, within the up-to-seven criteria in the BCLC intermediate stage. Lenvatinib provides a more favorable outcome than TACE, even in cases with large or multinodular HCC beyond the up-to-seven criteria with Child-Pugh grade A. When patients meet the definitions of TACE-refractory or TACE-unsuitable, switching to systemic chemotherapy, including lenvatinib, is for favorable for preserving liver function. If initial treatment, including MTA, has a significant therapeutic effect and downstaging of HCC is obtained, additional TACE or surgical resection should be considered. Lenvatinib also has a therapeutic effect for poorly differentiated type and non-simple nodular type HCC thanks to the survival-prolonging effect of this drug. Furthermore, a significant therapeutic effect is expected in tumors with more than 50% liver involvement or main portal vein invasion, which have traditionally been considered to have a poor prognosis in patients.

Cancer immunotherapies have been successfully bolstered by low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT), which is capable of reprogramming the tumor microenvironment (TME) from an immunosuppressive to an immunostimulatory one. Likewise, LDRT may be able to revoke the immune privilege enjoyed by the liver, permitting successful immunotherapies there. Here, we first review challenges that face the treatment of liver metastases. We next outline emerging preclinical and clinical evidence supporting enhanced systemic tumor control of LDRT in the context of cancer immunotherapy. Finally, we will discuss the rationale of combining liver-directed LDRT with immunostimulatory strategies to overcome immune resistance and achieve better clinical response.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer. Unfortunately, the traditional treatment methods to cure HCC showed poor efficacy in patients who are not candidates for liver transplantation. Until recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were the front-line treatment for unresectable liver cancer. However, rapidly emerging new data has drastically changed the landscape of HCC treatment. The combination treatment of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (immunotherapy plus anti-VEGF) was shown to provide superior outcomes and has become the new standard first-line treatment for unresectable or metastatic HCC. Currently, ongoing clinical trials with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) have focused on assessing the benefit of antibodies against programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte- associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) as monotherapies or combination therapies in patients with HCC.

Date of Publication: 3 Dec 2021","2021","11",,,,"3 Dec 2021","Background: Studies using data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world data (RWD) have suggested that adjuvant cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell immunotherapy after curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prolongs recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). However, the cost-effectiveness of CIK cell immunotherapy as an adjuvant therapy for HCC compared to no adjuvant therapy is uncertain. Methods: We constructed a partitioned survival model to compare the expected costs, life-year (LY), and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of a hypothetical population of 10,000 patients between CIK cell immunotherapy and no adjuvant therapy groups. Patients with HCC aged 55 years who underwent a potentially curative treatment were simulated with the model over a 20-year time horizon, from a healthcare system perspective. To model the effectiveness, we used OS and RFS data from RCTs and RWD. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and performed extensive sensitivity analyses. Results: Based on the RCT data, the CIK cell immunotherapy incrementally incurred a cost of $61,813, 2.07 LYs, and 1.87 QALYs per patient compared to no adjuvant therapy, and the estimated ICER was $33,077/QALY. Being less than the willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, CIK cell immunotherapy was cost-effective. Using the RWD, the ICER was estimated as $25,107/QALY, which is lower than that obtained using RCT. The time horizon and cost of productivity loss were the most influential factors on the ICER. Conclusion: We showed that receiving adjuvant CIK cell immunotherapy was more cost-effective than no adjuvant therapy in patients with HCC who underwent a potentially curative treatment, attributed to prolonged survival, reduced recurrence of HCC, and better prognosis of recurrence.

In China, phase II and a large phase III clinical trial of icaritin reagent for the treatment of hepatocellular cancer is under-going, but the specific mechanism of icaritin action was unclear. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), an oncofetal protein, produced in the healthy fetal liver and yolk sac. Intracellular AFP promoted cellular proliferation and inhibited cellular apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study was aimed to investigate the effect of icaritin on HCC through p53/AFP pathway. Methods: Real-time RT PCR and western blot were used to detect p53 and AFP expression levels in HCC cells treated with icaritin. The mechanism of icaritin affecting p53 expression was verified by ubiquitination experiment, and the binding activity of icaritin on p53 in AFP promoter region was verified by luciferase experiment. EdU, MTT and flow cytometry were used to determine whether icaritin affected HCC cellular proliferation and apoptosis through p53/ AFP pathway. Expression levels of p53 and AFP in xenograft mouse model were determined by western blotting. Results: Our results showed icaritin inhibited AFP expression at mRNA and protein level. AFP was also identified as the target gene of the p53 transcription factor. Icaritin abrogated murine double minute (Mdm) 2-mediated p53 ubiquitination degradation to improve the stability of p53. Up-regulated p53 protein levels then transcriptionally inhibited the AFP promoter. Icaritin-mediated decrease of AFP through Mdm2/p53 pathways inhibited HCC cellular proliferation and promoted HCC cellular apoptosis. Conclusion: Our findings revealed the mechanism of icaritin in promoting apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation in liver cancer cells.

"Systemic immune-inflammation index predicts prognosis of sequential therapy with sorafenib and regorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma","Hong Y.M., Yoon K.T., Cho M.","BMC Cancer (2021) 21:1 Article Number: 569. Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2021","2021","21","1",,,"1 Dec 2021","Background: Regorafenib has shown promising results as a second-line therapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who progressed on sorafenib. Although there have been several data regarding the efficacy of sequential therapy with sorafenib and that of regorafenib in real-life, specific inflammation markers for predicting the prognosis have not been studied. This study aimed to investigate prognostic value of systemic inflammatory markers in patients with HCC who received sorafenib-regorafenib sequential therapy. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed medical data of patients who received regorafenib for the treatment of HCC after sorafenib failure. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using the Kaplan–Meier survival curves. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze the factors associated with survival. Results: A total of 58 patients who received at least one dose of regroafenib and fulfilled the eligibility criteria, good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] 0–1) and preserved liver function (Child-Pugh-A), were included in the analysis. The median PFS was 3 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.981–5.019) and the median OS was 8 months (95% CI = 5.761–10.239). Elevated systemic immune-inflammation index (SII ≥340) was independently associated with poor OS. In multivariate analysis, the SII (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.211, 95% CI = 1.089–4.489, P = 0.028) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (HR = 2.750, 95% CI = 1.259–6.010, P = 0.011) were independent predictors of OS. Conclusion: Elevated SII is associated with poor OS in patients with HCC who received sequential therapy with sorafenib and regorafenib. In addition, when selecting a treatment strategy, the SII can be used in combination with the AFP level as a promising prognostic tool for HCC.",,,34006248,L2011573235,10.1186/s12885-021-08124-9

Although potentially curative therapies are available for the early and intermediate stages, the treatment of patients with advanced HCC remains to be resolved. Fortunately, the past few years have shown the emergence of successful systemic therapies to treat HCC. At the molecular level, HCC is a heterogeneous disease, and current research on the molecular characteristics of HCC has revealed numerous therapeutic targets. Targeted agents based on signalling molecules have been successfully supported in clinical trials, and molecular targeted therapy has already become a milestone for disease management in patients with HCC. Immunotherapy, a viable approach for the treatment of HCC, recognizes the antigens expressed by the tumour and treats the tumour using the immune system of the host, making it both selective and specific. In addition, the pipeline for HCC is evolving towards combination therapies with promising clinical outcomes. More drugs designed to focus on specific pathways and immune checkpoints are being developed in the clinic. It has been demonstrated that some drugs can improve the prognosis of patients with HCC in first- or second-line settings, and these drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration or are nearing approval. This review describes targeting pathways and systemic treatment strategies in HCC and summarizes effective targeted and immune-based drugs for patients with HCC and the problems encountered.",,,,L2013510330,10.1186/s40364-021-00319-3

Although several trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of HAIC, evidence corroborating its overall survival (OS) benefits compared with standard treatments is insufficient. Nevertheless, HAIC may provide prominent benefits in selected patients such as patients with portal vein thrombosis or high intrahepatic tumor burden. Moreover, HAIC has been combined with several therapeutic agents and modalities, including interferon-alpha, multikinase inhibitors, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy, to augment its treatment efficacy. Most of these combinations appeared to increase overall response rates compared with HAIC alone, but results regarding OS are inconclusive. Two prospective randomized controlled trials comparing HAIC plus sorafenib with sorafenib alone have reported conflicting results, necessitating further research. As immunotherapy-based combinations became the mainstream treatments for advanced HCC, HAIC plus immunotherapy-based treatments also showed encouraging preliminary results. The trials of HAIC were heterogeneous in terms of patient selection, chemotherapy regimens and doses, HAIC combination agent selections, and HAIC technical protocols. These heterogeneities may contribute to differences in treatment efficacy, thus increasing the difficulty of interpreting trial results. We propose that future trials of HAIC standardize these key factors to reveal the clinical value of HAIC-based treatments for HCC.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03775395, NCT04135690, NCT04191889, NCT04479527)",,34884684,L2014680172,10.3390/ijms222312880

However, not all patients and cancer types respond to ICI, or become resistant over time. Combining ICIs with therapeutic cancer vaccines is a promising option as vaccination may help to overcome resistance to immunotherapies while immunotherapies may increase immune responses to the particular cancer vaccine by reinvigorating exhausted T cells. Thus, it would be possible to reprogram a response with appropriate vaccines, using a particular cancer antigen and a corresponding ICI. Target populations include currently untreatable cancer patients or those who receive treatment regimens with high risk of serious side effects. In addition, with the increased use of ICI in clinical practice, questions arise regarding safety and efficacy of administration of conventional vaccines, such as influenza or COVID-19 vaccines, during active ICI treatment.

CSCs show intrinsic resistance to conventional therapies and phenotypic plasticity within the tumor, which make these a difficult target for conventional therapies. CSCs have different metabolic phenotypes based on their needs as compared to the bulk cancer cells. CSCs show metabolic plasticity and constantly alter their metabolic state between glycolysis and oxidative metabolism (OXPHOS) to adapt to scarcity of nutrients and therapeutic stress. The metabolic characteristics of CSCs are distinct compared to non-CSCs and thus provide an opportunity to devise more effective strategies to target CSCs. Mechanism for metabolic switch in CSCs is still unravelled, however existing evidence suggests that tumor microenvironment affects the metabolic phenotype of cancer cells.

REACH/REACH-2 were global phase III studies investigating ramucirumab in advanced HCC (aHCC) following sorafenib treatment. We performed an exploratory analysis of outcomes by liver disease aetiology and baseline serum viral load. Methods: Meta-analysis was conducted in patients with aHCC and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥400 ng/mL (N = 542) from REACH/REACH-2 trials. Individual patient-level data were pooled with results reported by aetiology subgroup (hepatitis B [HBV] or C [HCV] and Other). Pre-treatment serum HBV DNA and HCV RNA were quantified using Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model (stratified by study). Results: Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between arms in each subgroup (HBV: N = 225, HCV: N = 127, Other: N = 190). No significant difference in treatment effect by aetiology subgroup was detected (OS interaction P-value =.23).

Here, the change in the treatment strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using atezolizumab plus bevacizumab combination therapy is reviewed. The phase 3 IMbrave150 clinical trial was successful because of the direct antitumor effect of bevacizumab, which shifted the suppressive immune microenvironment to a responsive immune microenvironment, in addition to its synergistic effects when combined with atezolizumab. The analysis of CR cases was effective in patients with poor conditions, particularly tumor invasion in the main portal trunk (Vp4), making the combination therapy a breakthrough for HCC treatment. The response rate of the combination therapy was 44% against intermediate-stage HCC. Such a strong tumor-reduction effect paves the way for curative conversion (ABC conversion) therapy and, therefore, treatment strategies for intermediate-stage HCC may undergo a significant shift in the future.

Methods: We searched databases from inception until December 30, 2020 to identify phase 2 or 3 randomized clinical trials involving ICI treatments with data on hazard ratios (HRs) for survival according to viral infection status. We evaluated the heterogeneity between patients with and without viral infections using an interaction test. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore variations in the efficacy of immunotherapy according to viral infection status. Results: Six phase 3 trials with 3672 patients (1382 with viral infections [38%] and 2115 without viral infections [57%]) were included. Among these patients, the pooled HR for survival was 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60–0.79) for those with viral infections and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77–0.91) for those without infections after ICI treatment.

We compared the efficacy of TACE with cisplatin versus with epirubicin in patients with unresectable HCC. Methods: This multicentre, randomised, phase 2/3 trial was performed at 21 hospitals in Japan. Patients with liver-confined HCC, performance status 0–2, and Child-Pugh class A/B were randomised to receive TACE with cisplatin or epirubicin. Patients were stratified in accordance with the institution, Child-Pugh class, tumour size, tumour thrombosis, α-fetoprotein and prior treatment. The primary end-point was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Tumour response was evaluated in accordance with the Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours criteria. Findings: Between 2008 and 2012, 455 patients were randomly assigned to undergo TACE with cisplatin (n = 228) or epirubicin (n = 227). Eleven patients were ineligible, and 444 patients were included in the full analysis. Twelve patients not receiving TACE were excluded, and 432 patients were included in the safety analysis set. In phase 2, disease control rates in cisplatin (91·7%) and epirubicin (91·8%) groups exceeded the predefined threshold of 70%, and the study proceeded to phase 3. After a median follow-up of 32·7 months (IQR = 15·3–49·3), median overall survival periods were 2·93 years (95% CI 2·60–3·79) and 2·74 years (95%CI 2·26–3·21), respectively (hazard ratio 0·90 [95% CI 0·71–1·15], p = 0·22). Median times to treatment failure were 1·38 and 1·46 years (hazard ratio 1·09 [95% CI 0·88–1·35], p = 0·88), response rates were 65·3% and 60·6% (p = 0·31), and serious adverse event rates were 49·8% and 48·3% (p = 0·56), respectively. No treatment-related deaths occurred in either group. Interpretation: In our phase 2/3 randomised trial, cisplatin is not significantly superior to epirubicin in TACE for patients with HCC.","",,34563992,L2014702897,10.1016/j.ejca.2021.08.027

Right colon and left colon have different features while right colon cancer displays an even worse prognosis. The randomized phase III FOxTROT trial demonstrated better downstaging effect with neoadjuvant plus adjuvant chemotherapy compared with adjuvant chemotherapy alone (P=0.04).1 Moreover, 2-year relapse rate was improved with neoadjuvant therapy, though the difference was not statistically significant. The NICHE study of neoadjuvant immunotherapy (maximum 6 weeks) showed that the pathological response was observed in 20/20 mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) resectable colon cancers, with 19 major pathological responses and 12 pathological complete responses (pCRs).2 Recently, KEYNOTE-177 study showed improved progression-free survival with PD-1 inhibitor over chemotherapy (16.5 months vs. 8.2 months) in untreated microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/dMMR colon cancer patients, including 68% of right colon cancers.3 In addition, camrelizumab (PD-1 inhibitor) plus apatinib (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor) demonstrated favorable antitumor effects and a manageable safety profile in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer.4 5 This phase II trial aims to explore whether the combination of camrelizumab, apatinib and chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6) could significantly improve the pathological regression rate in locally advanced right colon cancer so as to bring considerable survival benefit for patients. Methods Eligible patients are aged 18-75 years, with locally advanced (T4 or T3 with extramural depth ≥5 mm, N0-2, M0, AJCC 8th) adenocarcinoma of right colon (including ileocecal area, ascending colon, and transverse colon to splenic flexion), and without prior systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy. All patients will receive 5 cycles of camrelizumab (200 mg once every 2 weeks) plus mFOLFOX6 and 2 months of apatinib (250 mg orally once a day), followed by surgery and 7 cycles of adjuvant camrelizumab plus mFOLFOX6.

Methods: We aimed to comprehensively review and compare the efficacy and safety of different MTDs, ICIs, HAIC and their combinations in AHCC. Adverse events (AEs), disease control rates (DCRs), objective response rates (ORRs), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed. Results: The pooled incidence rates of grade 1-5/3-5 AEs were 98.0%/48.6%, 98.3%/57.4%, 91.4%/22.0%, 96.4%/54.6%, 98.2%/61.1%, 86.3%/34.1%, 88.9%/9.4%, and 95.2%/53.2% for sorafenib, lenvatinib, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, HAIC-cisplatin plus sorafenib, HAIC-oxaliplatin, and HAIC-oxaliplatin plus sorafenib, respectively, which suggested that nivolumab exhibited optimal safety regarding grade 1-5 AEs, whereas HAIC-oxaliplatin monotherapy ranked lowest regarding grade 3-5 AEs. According to RECIST1.1, lenvatinib (72.8%), atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (73.6%), HAIC-oxaliplatin (78.8%) and HAIC-oxaliplatin plus sorafenib (75.2%) showed higher DCRs than sorafenib (57.3%), nivolumab (33.9%), and pembrolizumab (62.3%), whereas only HAIC-oxaliplatin-based treatments demonstrated a higher ORR than the others.

In order to render these patients susceptible to ICPI, initiation of de novo tumour-targeted immune responses is required. This involves triggering of inflammatory signalling, innate immune activation including recruitment and stimulation of dendritic cells (DCs), and ultimately priming of tumour-specific T cells. The ability of tumour localised therapies to trigger these pathways and act as in situ tumour vaccines is being increasingly explored, with the aspiration of developing combination strategies with ICPI that could generate long-lasting responses. In this effort, it is crucial to consider how therapy-induced changes in the tumour microenvironment (TME) act both as immune stimulants but also, in some cases, exacerbate immune resistance mechanisms. Increasingly refined immune monitoring in pre-clinical studies and analysis of on-treatment biopsies from clinical trials have provided insight into therapy-induced biomarkers of response, as well as actionable targets for optimal synergy between localised therapies and ICB.

METHODS: In this open-label, single-center, randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04127396), participants with previously untreated HCC and type I-IV PVTT were randomized 1:1 to receive TACE plus lenvatinib (arm L; orally once daily, 12 mg for body weight ≥60 kg or 8 mg for body weight <60 kg) or TACE plus sorafenib (arm S; 400 mg orally twice daily in 28-day cycles). The primary end point was time-to-progression (TTP; time from randomization to disease progression) and secondary end points included objective response rate and toxicity. Prognostic factors were evaluated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Between December 30, 2018 and May 31, 2020, 64 patients were randomized (arm L, n = 32; arm S, n = 32); most patients had type I/II PVTT (71.9%), and the median target tumor diameter was 9.8 cm (range, 3.8-21.8). After a median follow-up of 16.1 months, patients in arm L had a higher median TTP (4.7 vs 3.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32-0.95; P =.029) and objective response rate (53.1% vs 25.0%, P =.039) versus arm S.

CONCLUSIONS: TACE plus lenvatinib was safe, well tolerated, and had favorable efficacy versus TACE plus sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC with PVTT and large tumor burden. LAY SUMMARY: Hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus has a poor prognosis. In addition, most phase 3 trials of drugs for hepatocellular carcinoma exclude patients with major portal vein invasion, and treatment options for these patients are limited. Transarterial chemoembolization has shown promising efficacy in these patients, especially in combination with systemic treatment or radiotherapy.

Sorafenib, an orally available multikinase inhibitor, is a systemic therapy approved for treating patients with advanced HCC yet providing limited benefits. Consequently, new drugs have been developed to overcome sorafenib resistance and improve patients’ prognoses. A new promising strategy is using c-MET inhibitors, such as cabozantinib, as activation of c-MET occurs in up to 40% of HCC patients. In particular, cabozantinib, in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab, is currently in phase 3 clinical trial for HCC, and the results are eagerly awaited.

Early termination due to adverse events (AEs) was <5%, and Aramchol 600 and 400 mg were safe, well tolerated and without imbalance in serious or severe AEs between arms. Although the primary end point of a reduction in liver fat did not meet the prespecified significance level with Aramchol 600 mg, the observed safety and changes in liver histology and enzymes provide a rationale for SCD1 modulation as a promising therapy for NASH and fibrosis and are being evaluated in an ongoing phase 3 program.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02279524, NCT04104321)",,34621052,L2013891333,10.1038/s41591-021-01495-3

However, there is a paucity of prospective data and no phase 3 biomarker studies from North American populations. Methods: We conducted a prospective-specimen collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation (PRoBE) cohort study in which we enrolled patients with cirrhosis irrespective of etiology in a 6-monthly surveillance with liver imaging and AFP. Research blood samples were prospectively collected every 6 months and analyzed in a retrospective blinded fashion for AFP, AFP L-3 and DCP. We calculated the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) for detecting any HCC and early HCC (one nodule <5 cm) within 6, 12 and 24 months of HCC diagnosis based on published thresholds for each biomarker individually, in combination and in GALAD and HES scores. We also calculated the area under receiver operating curve (AUROC), and estimated TPR based on an optimal threshold at a fixed FPR of 10%. Results: The primary analysis was conducted in a cohort of 534 patients who underwent 1,362 surveillance episodes; 50 HCC cases of which 68% early, and 484 controls with consistently negative imaging. The mean age was 63.2 and 98% were men. The cirrhosis etiology was hepatitis C in 71%, alcohol abuse 61% and NAFLD in 21%. Using conventional cutoffs, GALAD had the highest TPR (63.6, 73.8 and 71.4% for all HCC, and 53.8, 63.3 and 61.8 % for early HCC within 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively) but more than a fifth of surveillance episodes had a false positive GALAD (FPR: 21.5-22.9%). However, there were no differences between in AUROC between GALAD, HES, AFP-3 or DCP. At a fixed 10% FPR, TPR for GALAD dropped considerably (42.4, 45.2 and 46.9%) and became not different from HES (36.4, 40.5 and 40.8%) or AFP-3 alone (39.4, 45.2 and 44.9%), within 6, 12 and 24 months (Fig 1). Conclusion: In a prospective cohort phase 3 biomarker study, we found that GALAD was associated with a considerable improvement in sensitivity for HCC detection but also a considerable increase in false positive results over individual or combined biomarkers. Therefore, the overall performance of GALAD was modest and not different from AFP-3 alone or HES. More work needs to be done in search of better HCC biomarkers. .",,,,L636384827,10.1002/hep.32187

The GALAD score (Gender, Age, AFP-L3, AFP, and Des-carboxy-prothrombin (DCP) has been shown in case-control studies to have excellent performance characteristics for early detection of HCC. Phase 3 biomarker studies are prospective cohort studies of patients with cirrhosis that aim to detect pre-clinical HCC. Our study aimed to determine if GALAD would be able to detect HCC prior to the actual diagnosis. Methods: The HEDS (Hepatocellular Carcinoma Early Detection Study) is an NCI-funded cohort, in which patients with cirrhosis were enrolled at 7 centers in the United States. All patients were without liver masses or hepatic decompensation. Surveillance for HCC was performed every 6 months at each site according to established guidelines, and HCC diagnosis was confirmed per AASLD guidelines. Blood for biomarker research was obtained and stored at each follow-up visit. Measurements of AFP, AFP-L3, and DCP (des-gamma carboxyprothrombin) were performed in a blinded fashion to the patient's status. The performance of GALAD in detecting HCC was evaluated within 6 and 12 months prior to diagnosis. AUROC and performance characteristics were performed, with sensitivity determined with specificity fixed at 90%. The study was powered to confirm tests with sensitivity > 60% at 90% specificity. Results: A total of 1,550 patients with cirrhosis were enrolled and followed for a median of 36 months. 42.2% had history of HCV infection, 20.8% had alcohol-related liver disease, and 21.6% had nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. During a follow up of 3,202 person years, there were 97 HCC detected (55-BCLC early stage (0/A)), for an annual incident rate of 2.7%. The AUROC for GALAD, AFP, AFP-L3 and DCP within 6 months prior to HCC diagnosis were 0.81, 0.73, 0.72, and 0.75, respectively. With specificity fixed at 90%, the sensitivity for GALAD (threshold of -0.8) within 6 months prior to HCC diagnosis was 50% (95%CI: 35% - 65%), compared to a sensitivity of 35% (95%CI:22%-49%) for AFP. When using the previously published GALAD threshold of -1.36, the sensitivity and specificity within 6 months prior to HCC diagnosis were 65% (95%CI: 50%-78%) and 82% (95%CI: 80%-85%), respectively. With specificity fixed at 90%, GALAD had a sensitivity of 49% (95%CI:37%-63%), compared to AFP 29% (95%CI:19%-40%) within 1-year prior to the diagnosis of HCC. The table below summarizes the findings. Conclusion: GALAD improves the detection of pre-clinical HCC 6 and 12 months prior to the actual diagnosis compared to AFP.",,,,L636385300,10.1002/hep.32187

The aMAP (Age, Male, Albumin-bilirubin, Platelets) score was recently developed and externally validated as a simple, reliable, and accurate means for assessing 5-year HCC risk due to viral and non-viral etiologies (J Hepatol 2020;73:1368-78). We utilized aMAP scores to assess HCC risk in CHB patients enrolled in prospective, randomized, tenofovir (TFV)-based trials. Methods: Data from GS-US-203-0101 (NCT00507507), a Phase 2 study of TFV disoproxil fumarate (TDF) vs TDF plus emtricitabine (FTC) in immune-tolerant (IT) patients, and 2 similarly-designed Phase 3 studies, GS-US-320-0108/GS-US-320-0110 (NCT01940341/NCT01940471), comparing tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) vs TDF in immune-active (IA) patients, were used to generate aMAP scores at baseline and over 192 (IT), or 240 (IA) weeks. Risk scores were categorized as: low-risk (0 to <50), medium-risk (50 to ≤60) and high-risk (>60) and shifts in risk categories were evaluated during treatment. Results: Of 126 (64 TDF; 62 TDF/FTC) IT patients (49% male, 89% Asian, 99% HBeAg-positive), mean (range) aMAP score was 41.4 (28.4-62.5) at baseline, with 113 (89.7%), 12 (9.5%) and 1 (0.8%) categorized as low-, medium-, or high-risk. At Week 192, mean (SD) change in aMAP was -2.0 (3.62); 100%, 58%, and 100% remained categorically unchanged, while 5/12 (42%) medium-risk patients shifted to low-risk status (Table). Changes in aMAP scores were similar with TDF vs TDF/FTC; no IT patients developed HCC. Of 1631 (1092 TAF; 539 TDF) IA patients (65% male, 83% Asian, 64% HBeAgpositive), mean (range) aMAP score was 47.6 (20.4-72.6) at baseline; 1033 (63.3%), 508 (31.1%), and 90 (5.6%) were low-, medium-, or high-risk (Table). At Week 240, mean (SD) change in aMAP was -2.12 (3.04); 97%, 61%, and 37%, low-, medium-, and high-risk patients remained unchanged; 39% and 63% medium- and high-risk patients improved, respectively, vs ≤3% (24 patients) shifting to a higher risk category. Changes were similar with TAF vs TDF. Overall, 22 HCC cases (1.3%) developed (0.2%, 1.8%, and 12.2% in low-, medium-, and high-risk patients at baseline). Conclusion: Use of aMAP risk scores support few IT or IA patients at low risk for HCC at treatment initiation progressing to higher risk, while many at medium- or high-risk improved to lower risk after up to 5 years of treatment.",,,,L636386181,10.1002/hep.32188

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2021","2021","74","SUPPL 1","310A","311A","1 Oct 2021","Background: Severe complications of COVID-19 observed in patients with liver cirrhosis might be partly explained by their immune dysfunction, which can also account for to the impaired response to existing vaccinations. Anti SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development has progressed at an unprecedented rate, with phase 3 trial data offering the prospect of achieving herd immunity. Despite the inclusion of 100,000 participants in these trials, data for patients with liver disease are scanty. In our study we described SARS-CoV-2 IgG response rate after vaccination and vaccine reaction in cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplant. Methods: We enrolled all patients waiting for liver transplant who completed anti COVID-19 vaccination between January and June 2021, in our Center. According to our National Health Care System recommendations, patients with a previous documented COVID-19 received a single vaccine dose, within 6 months after infection. All other patients received 2 doses, administered 3 weeks apart. Patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay, positive ≥33.8 BAU/mL) within one month after anti SARSCoV-2 mRNA vaccination (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech). Results: At the beginning and at the end of the enrollment period, 76 and 73 adult patients were on the liver transplant waiting list, respectively. Fifty of them completed anti COVID-19 vaccination and were suitable for the enrollment in the study. The median age of the patients was 56 years (IQR 52-61), 76% were male, median BMI 24.7 kg/m2 (IQR 23-27), 42% was blood type 0. Viral etiology 44%, alcoholrelated 20% and NAFLD 8%. 50% of the patients showed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Median MELD score at the entry on the liver transplant waiting list was 8 (7-11), while in non-HCC patients MELD score was 13 (10-18). Median creatinine clearance was 96 mL/min. 46 out of 50 patients (92%) received 2 doses of vaccine, while 4 out of 50 (8%) received only 1 dose, as per described protocol. SARS-CoV-2 IgG were tested after a median time of 19 days (IQR 9-28) since vaccination. 45 out of 46 patients (97.8%) who received 2 doses, became IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 positive (median value 1,599 BAU/mL, IQR 669-2,080). The 4 patients injected with only 1 dose were IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 positive at baseline (median value 291 BAU/mL, IQR 65-548) and they increased their titer after vaccination (median value 1,530 BAU/mL, IQR 829-1997). No patient experienced severe adverse reactions, and none tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination. Conclusion: In our cohort of 50 adult compensated cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplant (50% with HCC), 98% produced high levels of neutralizing IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after a median time of 19 days from mRNA vaccination. This excellent immunization rate is consistent with data reported in the healthy population.",,,,L636386295,10.1002/hep.32188

Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) has demonstrated high efficacy and a good safety profile with phase-III studies and real-life data. This study aims to present the 12th-month efficacy and safety data of TAF's real-life experience in Turkey. Methods: Pythagoras is a retrospective cohort study conducted in 14 centers in Southern Anatolia of Turkey. This study evaluated the 12-month treatment outcomes of 480 non-HIV patients over 18 year-age treated initially with or switch to TAF. Medical histories and laboratory findings were obtained from records to assess changes in virological and biochemical response, kidney and bone functions, and lipid parameters. Results: The median age of the patients was 46.5 (36 - 59) years, 68.1% were male, and 78.1% were treated with at least one antiviral agent (89.9% tenofovir disoproxil-TDF). The most common reason for switching to TAF treatment was the use of drugs that affect bone mineral density. The virological response was higher in treatment-experienced and naive CHB patients at 12th month than baseline. In TDF-experienced patients, a partial increase in the ALT normalization ratio according to AASLD criteria observed at the 12th month from baseline, but not significant. Abnormal ALT related factors at 12 months of switching from TDF to TAF; low age and albumin and high body mass index and cholesterol, but no independently associated marker detected in the multivariate regression analysis. In those with TDF experience, both renal and bone function indicators showed significant improvement in the first follow-up period of switching to TAF (p<0.05). However, no change was observed in the subsequent follow-ups. Only TDF-experienced patients showed an increase in lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol-LDLc values from baseline at third month (p<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in total cholesterol-Tc/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol-HDLc and Tc/HDLc ratios during 12 months in both TDF experienced and naive treatment patients. Conclusion: In the real-life data of our country, it was observed that effective virological and biochemical response was achieved with TAF treatment. The gain in renal and bone functions in the early period after switching to TAF treatment continues at the 12th month. In TDF-experienced patients, the increase in LDLc values at third month was associated with decreased systemic exposure of tenofovir and abolition of its lipid-lowering effect. However, no change was observed in the Tc/HDLc ratios used to estimate the risk of ischemic heart disease.",,,,L636386376,10.1002/hep.32188

Methods: uHCC patients who experienced tumor progression with sorafenib treatment and received regorafenib between March 2018 and November 2020 were enrolled. The primary end-point was overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints included safety, progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) and tumor response, assessed radiologically by using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Results: Eighty-six uHCC patients who received regorafenib following progression on sorafenib treatment were analyzed (median age, 66.5 years; 76.7% male). The median regorafenib treatment duration was 4.0 months (95% confidence intervals [CI], 3.6-4.6). Of 82 patients with regorafenib responses assessable, none achieved a complete response, 4 (4.9%) achieved a partial response, and 33 (40.2%) had stable disease, with a disease control rate of 45.1%. With regorafenib, the median PFS was 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.7-4.7), and the median OS was 12.4 months (95% CI, 7.8-17.0). Hepatitis C, albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade 1, and lack of macrovascular invasion were associated with better OS. Baseline serum alpha-fetoprotein ≥ 400 ng/mL was predictive of a poor OS, PFS, and disease control rate after regorafenib treatment, except for patients who experienced an early alpha-fetoprotein response (decline > 10% from baseline at treatment week 4). The most frequently reported adverse events were hand-foot skin reaction (44.2%) and diarrhea (36.0%). Conclusion: The results of this real-world study verified the tolerability and efficacy of regorafenib treatment for uHCC that progressed on prior sorafenib treatment.

Until recently, there were no approved treatments options. In 2020, European Medicines Agency conditionally approved bulevirtide (BLV 2mg) as the first treatment for CHD. This abstract reports exploratory interim analysis of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) benefits of the 24-week treatment with approved BLV-2mg dose in CHD patients within an ongoing Phase 3 trial. Methods: In MYR301-a randomized, openlabel, parallel-group, multicentre Phase 3 clinical trial-CHD patients were randomised (1:1:1) to and started receiving three treatments (BLV 2mg or 10mg or delayed-treatment [DT]) for a total of 3 years). The BLV 10mg data are not reported as not regulatory approved. DT patients received no active treatment until week 48. Prior to initiating study-visit activities, patients completed the Hepatitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (HQLQTM, including SF-36 and 15 supplemental items) at baseline (BL) and Week 24 (W24) with subsequent periodic intervals throughout the study. Results: At BL, the subjects receiving BLV 2mg (n=49, mean±SD age 43.6 (±9.0), BMI 24.4 (kg/m), 61.2% male, 48% with cirrhosis) and DT (n=51, reported mean±SD age 40.5 (±7.5), BMI 25.26 (kg/m), 51% male, 51% with cirrhosis) reported varying levels of HRQoL (Table). From BL to W24, BLV 2mg-treated patients reported improvements in all domains on the HQLQTM, notably >5-point improvements in general health, bodily pain, vitality, mental health, hepatitis-specific (HS) limitations, and HS health distress and >4 points in social functioning and role functioningemotional domains. The DT patients reported >5-point improvements in mental health and HS health distress and >4-points on HS limitations. Conclusion: Both BLV 2mg and DT groups reported improvements from BL to W24 in HRQoL measured by HQLQTM, most notably in HS limitations, HS health in distress, and mental health. However more domain improvements were observed with BLV 2mg most notably in general health, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, and role functioning-emotional than with the DT arm.

Here, we report data from an exploratory analysis of patients with non-viral HCC etiology using updated IMbrave150 data (median follow-up: 15.6 mo; Finn RS ASCO GI 2021). Methods: IMbrave150 enrolled patients with systemic treatment-naive unresectable HCC and ≥1 measurable untreated lesion (RECIST 1.1), Child-Pugh class A liver function and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score 0 or 1, including those with non-viral etiology. Patients were randomized 2:1 to atezo 1200 mg + bev 15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks or sor 400 mg PO twice daily until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit per investigator. Results: Of the 501 enrolled patients, 153 (31%) had non-viral etiology (100 received atezo + bev and 53 received sor). Patients with non-viral etiology had baseline characteristics that were consistent with those of the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. In the non-viral population, median body mass index was 26.7 kg/m2 and 27.8 kg/m2 in the atezo + bev arm and the sor arm, respectively, and alphafetoprotein ≥400 ng/mL was observed in 29 (29%) and 20 patients (38%), respectively.

Methods: HOPE-B is an open-label, single-dose, single-arm, international trial in adult males with FIX≤2% on routine FIX prophylaxis ( n = 54). Participants with a history of, or well-controlled, hepatitis B/C infection were permitted in the study. Patients with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis (fibroscan ≥9 KPa) were excluded. Participants received a single intravenous dose of etranacogene dezaparvovec (2 × 10(13) gc/kg) and will be followed for 5 years. Liver-specific assessments include twice-yearly assessment of alpha-fetoprotein and annual ultrasound. Results: A liver lesion was detected by ultrasound in one participant during routine study assessment at 1 year post-dose. The participant was >65 years old, with a history of hepatitis C (eradicated 3 years prior to enrolment), hepatitis B and evidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver changes on biopsy. Hepatic ultrasound at study entry was normal. Alphafetoprotein, alanine-aminotransferase, and aspartate-aminotransferase levels were within normal limits and stable during the preceding study year. FIX activity was stable in the mild to nonhemophilic range without apparent upward/downward trend. Following surgical resection, tissue will undergo analysis for vector copy number and integration sites. Conclusions: This is the first reported case of HCC in a participant undergoing liver-directed AAV-based gene therapy. Risk factors for HCC are prevalent in the hemophilia population, including this participant. A full investigation will be conducted into possible contributing factors. Ultrasound monitoring of all participants enrolled in etranacogene dezaparvovec clinical trials will be increased to twice yearly regardless of HCC risk.",,,,L636407117,10.1002/rth2.12591

OBJECTIVE To report the long-term outcomes of TACE-RFA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study analyzed long-term follow-up data from a phase 3 randomized clinical trial of adults with early HCC conducted from October 2006 to June 2009. Participants were randomly assigned to the TACE-RFA group or the RFA group in a 1:1 ratio and followed up approximately 6 years after the trial was closed. Data analysis was performed March 2020. EXPOSURE In the TACE-RFA group, TACE was performed first, and RFA was done 2 weeks later. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS Of 189 patients who were included (mean [SD] age, 54.3 [12.0] years; 146 [77.2%] men), 94 and 95 patients were assigned to the TACE-RFA group and RFA group, respectively, with their baseline characteristics well matched. Three patients in each group were lost to follow-up. The 5-year and 7-year OS rates for the TACE-RFA group vs the RFA group were 52.0% and 36.4% vs 43.2% and 19.4%, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39-0.78; P = .001). The 5-year and 7-year RFS rates for the TACE-RFA group vs the RFA group were 41.4% and 34.5% vs 27.4% and 18.1%, respectively (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49-0.89; P = .007). On subgroup analysis comparing patients who had tumors larger than 3 cm with those who had tumors 3 cm or smaller, the OS and RFS survival rates in the TACE-RFA group (HR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.91-5.35, P < .001) were significantly better than those in the RFA group (HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.30-3.17; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort study, combined RFA and TACE was associated with better survival than RFA alone on long-term follow-up. Patients with tumors 3 cm or smaller did not benefit as well as patients with tumors larger than 3 cm from the combined treatment.",,,34570206,L636088806,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.26992

The International Rare Cancer Consortium defines rare cancer incidence as less than six per 100,000 per year. There is a growing number of reports of the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in patients with rare tumours, and hence, we conducted a comprehensive review to summarise and analyse the available literature. Methods: A literature search of PubMed was performed on January 31, 2021, using the following ICI names as keywords: ipilimumab, tremelimumab, cemiplimab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, avelumab, atezolizumab, and durvalumab. Studies on patients with rare tumours who were being treated with ICIs were included. We plotted the overall response rate against the corresponding median survival across a variety of cancer types using linear regression. Results: From 1,255 publications retrieved during the primary search, 62 publications were selected (with a total of 4,620 patients). Only four were randomised trials. A minority were first-line studies, while the remaining were studies in which ICIs were delivered as salvage therapy in pretreated patients. There was a good correlation between response rate and overall survival (Spearman R(2) >0.9) in skin cancers, mesothelioma, and sarcomas. Conclusions: Treatment of advanced-stage rare tumours with ICI therapy was found to be associated with significant activity in some orphan diseases (e.g., Merkel cell carcinoma) and hepatocellular carcinoma. Several ongoing prospective clinical trials will expand the knowledge on the safety and efficacy of ICI therapy in patients with these rare cancers.",,,34616395,L636139031,10.3389/fimmu.2021.720748

Here, we evaluated pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety by hepatic impairment status and geographic region. Methods: Patients received atezolizumab 1,200 mg + bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks. Drug concentrations were evaluated by descriptive statistics and population PK. PK and adverse event frequencies were evaluated by hepatic impairment status and region. Results: 323 IMbrave150 patients and 162 GO30140 patients were PK evaluable. Compared with IMbrave150 patients who had normal hepatic function per the National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI-ODWG) criteria (n = 123), patients with mild impairment (n = 171) had a geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 0.92 for cycle 1 atezolizumab area under the concentration-time curve (AUC); patients with moderate impairment (n = 27) had a GMR of 0.88. Patients in Asia ([n = 162] vs. outside [n = 161]) had a GMR of 1.25 for cycle 1 atezolizumab AUC. Compared with GO30140 patients who had normal hepatic function (NCI-ODWG [n = 61]), patients with mild impairment (n = 92) had a GMR of 0.97 for cycle 1 peak bevacizumab concentrations; those with moderate impairment (n = 9) had a GMR of 0.94.

However, in the two groundbreaking phase III clinical trials, the SHARP and Asia-Pacific trials, sorafenib has demonstrated a modest prolongation of overall survival in almost 30% of HCC patients. As HCC develops in an immune-rich milieu, particular attention has been placed on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as a novel therapeutic modality for HCC. Yet, HCC therapy is hampered by the resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and the subsequent tumor recurrence.

We aimed to analyze the current evidence and identify potential factors influencing response to therapies. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of phase III RCTs (2002–2020) across disease stages. A meta-analysis was designed to examine the relationship between etiology and outcome after systemic therapies with either tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI)/antiangiogenic or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Results: Out of 10,100 studies identified, 76 were phase III RCTs. Among them, a rigorous screening algorithm identified 49 with high quality including a total of 22,113 patients undergoing adjuvant (n = 7) and primary treatment for early (n = 2), intermediate (n = 7), and advanced (first-line, n = 21; second-line, n = 12) stages of disease.

This analysis assessed correlations between serum or tissue biomarkers and efficacy outcomes from REFLECT. Experimental Design: Serum biomarkers (VEGF, ANG2, FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23) were measured by ELISA. Gene expression in tumor tissues was measured by the nCounter Pan- Cancer Pathways Panel. Pharmacodynamic changes in serum biomarker levels from baseline, and associations of clinical outcomes with baseline biomarker levels, were evaluated. Results: Four hundred and seven patients were included in the serum analysis set (lenvatinib n = 279, sorafenib n = 128); 58 patients were included in the gene-expression analysis set (lenvatinib n = 34, sorafenib n = 24). Both treatments were associated with increases in VEGF; only lenvatinib was associated with increases in FGF19 and FGF23 at all time points. Lenvatinib-treated responders had greater increases in FGF19 and FGF23 versus nonresponders at cycle 4, day 1 (FGF19: 55.2% vs. 18.3%, P = 0.014; FGF23: 48.4% vs. 16.4%, P = 0.0022, respectively). Higher baseline VEGF, ANG2, and FGF21 correlated with shorter OS in both treatment groups. OS was longer for lenvatinib than sorafenib [median, 10.9 vs. 6.8 months, respectively; HR, 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.33-0.85; P-interaction = 0.0397] with higher baseline FGF21. In tumor tissue biomarker analysis, VEGF/FGF-enriched groups showed improved OS with lenvatinib versus the intermediate VEGF/FGF group (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16-0.91; P = 0.0253). Conclusions: Higher baseline levels of VEGF, FGF21, and ANG2 may be prognostic for shorter OS. Higher baseline FGF21 may be predictive for longer OS with lenvatinib compared with sorafenib, but this needs confirmation.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01761266, NCT03713593)",,34108184,L2014398616,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-4219

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2021","2021","32",,"S818",,"1 Sep 2021","Background: First-line atezo + bev has been approved in >70 countries based on significantly longer overall and progression-free survival (OS/PFS) vs sor in patients (pts) with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at the primary analysis of IMbrave150 (NCT03434379). We report exploratory efficacy and safety in pts without MVI or EHS after 12 mo additional follow-up. Methods: In this open-label, phase III study, 501 systemic treatment–naive pts with unresectable HCC, ≥1 measurable untreated lesion (RECIST 1.1), Child-Pugh A liver function and ECOG PS 0/1 were randomised 2:1 to atezo 1200 mg IV q3w + bev 15 mg/kg IV q3w or sor 400 mg bid. BCLC B pts or BCLC C pts without MVI or EHS were included in this analysis. Results: At baseline, 111 pts did not have MVI or EHS. Of the 72 MVI− EHS− pts receiving atezo + bev, 37 (51%) had prior locoregional therapy (LRT) with 32 (44%) receiving at least one TACE. Of the 39 MVI− EHS− pts receiving sor, 24 (62%) had prior LRT with 20 (51%) receiving at least one TACE. At the 31 Aug 2020 data cutoff, median (m) OS in these pts was 24.6 mo with atezo + bev and 18.1 mo with sor (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.34, 1.01); mPFS was 9.6 and 8.3 mo, respectively (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.52, 1.26). See Table for responses by independent review facility (IRF) RECIST 1.1 and HCC modified RECIST (mRECIST). Complete response by IRF RECIST 1.1 was achieved in 7 atezo + bev pts (10%) and 0 sor pts. Treatment-related Grade 3/4 AEs occurred in 71 atezo + bev pts (49%) and 38 sor pts (47%). Any-grade bleeding/haemorrhage AEs occurred in 34% (Grade 3/4 11%) of atezo + bev and 32% (Grade 3/4 21%) of sor pts. Conclusions: Atezo + bev is the standard of care for pts with unresectable HCC. The relative benefit of atezo + bev vs sor is maintained in pts without MVI or EHS, noting improved absolute results vs ITT. Safety outcomes were consistent with those in the ITT population.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2021","2021","32",,"S828",,"1 Sep 2021","Background: Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Ate/Bev) has demonstrated the efficacy and safety in patients with advanced HCC (aHCC) as first-line treatment in the IMbrave 150 trial. Further evaluation in real-world setting is necessary to define prognostic factors with Ate/Bev treatment. Methods: This is a multicenter, retrospective analysis performed by Korean Cancer Study Group (KCSG). Between May 2020 and February 2021, a total of 138 patients received Ate/Bev as first line treatment for aHCC from 11 Korean referral cancer institutions. We excluded patients with Child B/C class and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage (BCLC) D stage aHCC, and the remaining 121 patients who had at least one follow-up visit after the start of Ate/Bev were included in this analysis. Results: Patients characteristics were as follows: median age of 61 years (range, 36-83); hepatitis B (n=93, 76.9%), hepatitis C (n=6, 5.0%), non-viral (n=22, 18.2%); BCLC B/C (n=25, 20.7%/n=96, 79.3%); macrovascular invasion (n=45, 37.2%); extrahepatic metastasis (n=85, 70.2%); and AFP ≥ 400 ng/ml (n=46, 38.0%). According to the RECIST 1.1, 2 patients achieved complete response (CR) and 27 patients achieved a partial response (PR), resulting in an overall response rate of 24.0% and disease control rate of 76.0%. The median follow-up duration was 5.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4-6.4), the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.5 months (95% CI, 4.1-9.0), and median overall survival was not reached (95% CI, not available). Multivariate Cox analysis identified that baseline AFP<400 ng/ml (vs AFP≥400, hazard ratio [HR] 0.44, 95% CI 0.25-0.76, p=0.003) and AFP decrease ≥ 50% at first evaluation (vs <50% decrease or increase, HR 0.29, 95% CI, 0.09-0.99, p=0.048), baseline neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) <5 (vs ≥5, HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.87, p=0.018) and best response of CR or PR (vs stable disease or progressive disease, HR 0.38, 95% CI, 0.14-0.99, p=0.049) were independent predictors of better PFS. Conclusions: Ate/Bev showed real-life efficacy and safety outcomes for Korean aHCC patients in line with the results of a pivotal phase III trial. Baseline AFP, NLR, AFP response and tumor response (CR or PR) were associated with better PFS. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors. Funding: Has not received any funding.

Methods: In this multicenter, open-labeled, single-arm, phase II trial, advanced HCC pts categorized as Child-Pugh class A with no prior history of systemic therapy were enrolled to receive Len+CDDP (lenvatinib: 12 mg once daily for patients weighing ≥60 kg, 8 mg once daily for patients weighing <60 kg; HAIC with CDDP: 65 mg/m2, day 1, every 4 to 6 weeks, up to a maximum of 6 cycles). The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) as assessed with modified RECIST by an independent review committee (IRC). The secondary endpoints were the ORR as assessed with RECIST v1.1 by IRC, the progression-free survival, the overall survival, and frequency of adverse events associated with the treatment. The threshold and expected ORRs were 20% and 40%, respectively at a one-sided significance level of 0.05, and statistical power of 80%. Based on these data, the number of pts required was estimated to be 35. Results: A total of 36 pts were enrolled between September 2018 and March 2020, but two pts were judged as having no measurable lesions by the IRC. Among the remaining 34 evaluable pts, the ORR by the IRC according to modified RECIST and RECISTv1.1 were 64.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 46.5%-80.3%), and 45.7% (95% CI: 28.8%-63.4%), respectively. The study treatment was discontinued in all the 36 pts for the following reasons: disease progression (24 pts, 67%), adverse events (9 pts, 25%), others (3 pts, 8%). The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.3 months (95% CI: 5.1-7.9 months) and 17.2 months (95% CI: 10.9-NA, months), respectively. The main grade 3-4 adverse events were increased AST (34%), hyponatremia (25%), leukopenia (22%), increased ALT (19%), and hypertension (11%). There were no treatment-related deaths in this series. Conclusions: Len+CDDP yielded very favorable ORR and overall survival, and was well-tolerated in pts with advanced HCC. Further evaluation of this regimen in a phase III trial is warranted.

"Cost-effectiveness of obeticholic acid for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: An early economic evaluation","Tran C.-P., Kim J.J., Feld J.J., Wong W.W.L.","Canadian Liver Journal (2021) 4:4 (360-369). Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2021","2021","4","4","360","369","1 Sep 2021","BACKGROUND: Currently, there are no pharmacological options available for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In the 18-month interim analysis of an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (REGENERATE), early results demonstrated that obeticholic acid (OCA) 25 mg significantly improved fibrosis with no worsening of NASH among patients with NASH and fibrosis compared with placebo (PBO). This study aimed to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of OCA compared with PBO in NASH patients. METHODS: A state-transition model was developed to perform a cost-utility analysis comparing two treatment strategies, PBO and OCA 25 mg, from a Canadian public payer perspective. The model time horizon was lifetime with annual cycle lengths. Cost and utility parameters were discounted at 1.5% annually. The efficacy data were obtained from the REGENERATE trial, and costs and utilities were derived from other published literature. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Treatment with OCA led to reductions of 3.58% in decompensated cirrhosis cases, 3.95% in hepatocellular carcinoma, 7.88% in liver transplant, and 6.01% in liver-related death. However, at an annual price of CAD $36,000, OCA failed to be cost-effective compared with PBO at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $815,514 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). An 88% reduction in drug price to an annual cost of $4,300 would make OCA cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: OCA failed to be cost-effective compared with PBO, despite demonstrating clinical benefits due to a high drug cost.

Chronic HBV/HDV coinfection is associated with an unfavourable outcome, with many patients developing liver cirrhosis, liver failure and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma within 5-10 years. The identification of the HBV/HDV receptor and the development of novel in vitro and animal infection models allowed a more detailed study of the HDV life cycle in recent years, facilitating the development of specific antiviral drugs. The characterisation of HDV-specific CD4+ and CD8+T cell epitopes in untreated and treated patients also permitted a more precise understanding of HDV immunobiology and possibly paves the way for immunotherapeutic strategies to support upcoming specific therapies targeting viral or host factors. Pegylated interferon-α has been used for treating HDV patients for the last 30 years with only limited sustained responses. Here we describe novel treatment options with regard to their mode of action and their clinical effectiveness. Of those, the entry-inhibitor bulevirtide (formerly known as myrcludex B) received conditional marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) in 2020 (Hepcludex). One additional drug, the prenylation inhibitor lonafarnib, is currently under investigation in phase III clinical trials.

Surgical resection and local ablation are potentially curative options for patients with HCC; however, tumor recurrence is not uncommon. The lack of a standard-of-care adjuvant therapy for HCC highlights an urgent therapeutic need to prevent disease recurrence and improve overall survival. Pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, has shown evidence of a favorable benefit-to-risk profile in the adjuvant setting for many tumor types but has not been investigated in HCC. The KEYNOTE-937 study (NCT03867084) will evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab versus placebo as adjuvant therapy in patients with HCC who had a complete radiologic response after surgical resection or local ablation. Methods KEYNOTE-937 is a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study. Adults with confirmed HCC, complete radiologic response after surgical resection or local ablation, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and Child-Pugh liver class A are eligible. Patients with past or ongoing hepatitis C or controlled hepatitis B virus infection may be enrolled if they meet prespecified criteria. Patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously or placebo intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 17 cycles or until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal and will be stratified by geographic region, prior local therapy (resection vs ablation), recurrence risk, and alpha-fetoprotein level at diagnosis. Coprimary end points are recurrence-free survival and overall survival; secondary end points are safety and tolerability (graded per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0) and health-related quality of life; exploratory end points include distant metastasis-free survival, time to recurrence, and genomic, metabolic, and/or proteomic biomarkers. Tumor imaging will be assessed until recurrence, and adverse events will be recorded up to 30 days after the last dose (90 days for serious adverse events). Results Recruitment began in May 2019.

Since the first trial with tremelimumab, a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 inhibitor, increasing evidence has confirmed that these drugs can significantly extend the survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As a matter of fact, the overall survival and objective response rates reported in patients with advanced HCC treated with ICIs are the highest ever reported in the second-line setting and, most recently, the combination of the anti-programmed death ligand protein-1 atezolizumab with bevacizumab—an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody—demonstrated superiority to sorafenib in a Phase III randomized clinical trial. Therefore, this regimen has been approved in several countries as first-line treatment for advanced HCC and is soon expected to be widely used in clinical practice. However, despite the promising results of trials exploring ICIs alone or in combination with other agents, there are still some critical issues to deal with to optimize the prognosis of advanced HCC patients. For instance, the actual proportion of patients who are deemed eligible for ICIs in the real-life ranges from 10% to 20% in the first-line setting, and is even lower in the second-line scenario. Moreover, long-term data regarding the safety of ICIs in the population of patients with cirrhosis and impaired liver function are lacking. Lastly, no biomarkers have been identified to predict response, and thus to help clinicians to individually tailor treatment. This review aimed to summarize the state of the art immunotherapy in HCC and, by analyzing a large, multicenter cohort of Italian patients with HCC, to assess the potential applicability of the combination of atezolizumab/bevacizumab in the real-life setting.",,,,L2007862359,10.3390/jcm10153201

Exploratory analyses characterized objective response rate (ORR), depth (DpR), and duration of response (DoR), and patients with a complete response (CR). Methods: Patients were randomized 2:1 to intravenous ATEZO (1200 mg) + BEV (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks or oral SOR (400 mg) twice daily. Tumors were evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and HCC-modified RECIST (mRECIST). ORR by prior treatment and largest baseline liver lesion size, DoR, time to response (TTR), and complete response (TTCR) were analyzed. Results: For both criteria, responses favored ATEZO/BEV versus SOR regardless of prior treatment and in patients with lesions ≥3 cm. Median TTR was 2.8 months per RECIST 1.1 (range: 1.2–12.3 months) and 2.8 months per mRECIST (range: 1.1–12.3 months) with ATEZO/BEV. Patients receiving ATEZO/BEV had a greater DpR, per both criteria, across baseline liver lesion sizes. Characteristics of complete responders were similar to those of the intent-to-treat population. In complete responders receiving ATEZO/BEV per mRECIST versus RECIST 1.1, respectively, median TTCR was shorter (5.5 vs. 7.0 months), mean baseline sum of lesion diameter was longer (5.0 [SD, 5.1] vs. 2.6 [SD, 1.4] cm), and mean largest liver lesion size was larger (4.8 [SD, 4.2] vs. 2.3 [SD, 1.0] cm).

Curative-intent treatment typically involves surgery, yet recurrence is common and many patients present with advanced disease not amenable to an operation. Immunotherapy represents a promising approach to improve outcomes, but the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of the liver characteristic of hepatobiliary cancers has hampered the development and implementation of this therapeutic approach. Current immunotherapies under investigation include immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), the adoptive transfer of immune cells, bispecific antibodies, vaccines, and oncolytic viruses. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) are two ICIs that have demonstrated utility in HCC, and newer immune checkpoint targets are being tested in clinical trials. In advanced CCA and GBC, PD-1 ICIs have resulted in antitumor responses, but only in a minority of select patients. Other ICIs are being investigated for patients with CCA and GBC. Adoptive transfer may hold promise, with reports of complete durable regression in metastatic CCA, yet this therapeutic approach may not be generalizable. Alternative approaches have been developed and promising results have been observed, but clinical trials are needed to validate their utility. While the treatment of hepatobiliary cancers involves unique challenges that these cancers present, the progress seen with ICIs and adoptive transfer has solidified immunotherapy as an important approach in these challenging patients with few other effective treatment options.",,,34440865,L2013396096,10.3390/cells10082096

Preservation of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during treatment is an important therapeutic goal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of treatment with lenvatinib versus sorafenib on HRQOL. Methods: REFLECT was a previously published multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib versus sorafenib as a first-line systemic treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and one or more measurable target lesion per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C categorisation, Child-Pugh class A, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1 or lower, and adequate organ function. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice–web response system; stratification factors for treatment allocation included region; macroscopic portal vein invasion, extrahepatic spread, or both; ECOG performance status; and bodyweight. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), collected at baseline, on day 1 of each subsequent cycle, and at the end of treatment, were evaluated in post-hoc analyses of secondary and exploratory endpoints in the analysis population, which was the subpopulation of patients with a PRO assessment at baseline. A linear mixed-effects model evaluated change from baseline in PROs, including European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and hepatocellular carcinoma-specific QLQ-HCC18 scales (both secondary endpoints of the REFLECT trial). Time-to-definitive-deterioration analyses were done based on established thresholds for minimum differences for worsening in PROs. Responder analyses explored associations between HRQOL and clinical response. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01761266. Findings: Of 954 eligible patients randomly assigned to lenvatinib (n=478) or sorafenib (n=476) between March 14, 2013, and July 30, 2015, 931 patients (n=468 for lenvatinib; n=463 for sorafenib) were included in this analysis. Baseline PRO scores reflected impaired HRQOL and functioning and considerable symptom burden relative to full HRQOL. Differences in overall mean change from baseline estimates in most PRO scales generally favoured the lenvatinib over the sorafenib group, although the differences were not nominally statistically or clinically significant. Patients treated with lenvatinib experienced nominally statistically significant delays in definitive, meaningful deterioration on the QLQ-C30 fatigue (hazard ratio [HR] 0·83, 95% CI 0·69–0·99), pain (0·80, 0·66–0·96), and diarrhoea (0·52, 0·42–0·65) domains versus patients treated with sorafenib. Significant differences in time to definitive deterioration were not observed for other QLQ-C30 domains, and there was no difference in time to definitive deterioration on the global health status/QOL score (0·89, 0·73–1·09). For most PRO scales, differences in overall mean change from baseline estimates favoured responders versus non-responders. Across all scales, HRs for time to definitive deterioration were in favour of responders; median time to definitive deterioration for responders exceeded those for non-responders by a range of 4·8 to 14·6 months. Interpretation: HRQOL for patients undergoing treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma is an important therapeutic consideration. The evidence of HRQOL benefits in clinically relevant domains support the use of lenvatinib compared with sorafenib to delay functional deterioration in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

DC vaccines work based on the fundamental characteristics of DCs, which are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), responsible for the uptake, processing, and presentation of antigens to T cells to activate immune responses. Neoantigens can exert their antitumor effects only after they are taken up by APCs and presented to T cells. In recent years, neoantigen-based personalized tumor therapeutic vaccines have proven to be safe, immunogenic and feasible treatment strategies in patients with melanoma and glioblastoma that provide new hope in the treatment of cancer patients and a new approach to cure cancer. In addition, according to ClinicalTrials.gov, hundreds of registered DC vaccine trials are either completed or ongoing worldwide, of which 9 are in early phase I, 191 in phase I, 166 in phase II and 8 in phase III. Hundreds of clinical studies on therapeutic tumor vaccines globally have proven that DC vaccines are stable, reliable and very safe. However, in this process, many other factors still limit the effectiveness of the vaccine. This review will focus on the current research progress on personalized neoantigen-pulsed DC vaccines, their limitations and future research directions of DC vaccines loaded with neoantigens. This review aims to provide a better understanding of DCs biology and manipulation of activated DCs for DCs researchers to produce the next generation of highly efficient cancer vaccines for patients.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00103116, NCT00970203, NCT00978913, NCT01042535, NCT01671592, NCT01885702, NCT01970358, NCT02018458, NCT02063724, NCT02129075, NCT02287428, NCT02528682, NCT02632019, NCT02950766, NCT02956551, NCT03205930, NCT03359239, NCT03548571, NCT03558945, NCT03606967, NCT03674073, NCT03715985, NCT03730948, NCT03871205, NCT03914768, NCT04072900, NCT04078269, NCT04105582, NCT04147078, NCT04161755, NCT04397003, NCT04487093, NCT04567069, NCT04627246, NCT04749641, NCT04879888)",,,L635675239,10.3389/fonc.2021.701777

Date of Publication: 14 Jul 2021","2021","27","26","4104","4142","14 Jul 2021","The population of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) overlaps to a high degree with those for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The degrees of renal dysfunction vary, from the various stages of CKD to dialysis-dependent ESRD, which often affects the prognosis and treatment choice of patients with HCC. In addition, renal dysfunction makes treatment more difficult and may negatively affect treatment outcomes. This study summarized the possible causes of the high comorbidity of HCC and renal dysfunction. The possible mechanisms of CKD causing HCC involve uremia itself, long-term dialysis status, immunosuppressive agents for postrenal transplant status, and miscellaneous factors such as hormone alterations and dysbiosis. The possible mechanisms of HCC affecting renal function include direct tumor invasion and hepatorenal syndrome. Finally, we categorized the risk factors that could lead to both HCC and CKD into four categories: Environmental toxins, viral hepatitis, metabolic syndrome, and vasoactive factors. Both CKD and ESRD have been reported to negatively affect HCC prognosis, but more research is warranted to confirm this. Furthermore, ESRD status itself ought not to prevent patients receiving aggressive treatments. This study then adopted the well-known Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer guidelines as a framework to discuss the indicators for each stage of HCC treatment, treatment-related adverse renal effects, and concerns that are specific to patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction when undergoing aggressive treatments against CKD and ESRD. Such aggressive treatments include liver resection, simultaneous liver kidney transplantation, radiofrequency ablation, and transarterial chemoembolization. Finally, focusing on patients unable to receive active treatment, this study compiled information on the latest systemic pharmacological therapies, including targeted and immunotherapeutic drugs. Based on available clinical studies and Food and Drug Administration labels, this study details the drug indications, side effects, and dose adjustments for patients with renal dysfunction. It also provides a comprehensive review of information on HCC patients with renal dysfunction from disease onset to treatment.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02608268, NCT02817633, NCT03307785, NCT03489343, NCT03680508, NCT03708328, NCT3446040)",,34326614,L2013553451,10.3748/wjg.v27.i26.4104

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in patients with pretreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: AHELP was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 31 hospitals in China, in patients (aged ≥18 years) with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who had previously been refractory or intolerant to at least one line of systemic chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive apatinib 750 mg or placebo orally once daily in 28-day treatment cycles. Group allocation was done with a central randomisation system, with a block size of six, and was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, previous sorafenib treatment, and presence of vascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis. The primary endpoint was overall survival, which was defined as time from randomisation to death from any cause, and was analysed in patients who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of the study drug. Safety analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment and had post-dose safety assessments. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02329860. Findings: Between April 1, 2014, and May 3, 2017, 400 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive apatinib (n=267) or placebo (n=133). Seven patients (six in the apatinib group and one in the placebo group) did not receive study treatment and were excluded from efficacy analyses. Overall survival was significantly improved in the apatinib group compared with the placebo group (median 8·7 months [95% CI 7·5‒9·8] vs 6·8 months [5·7‒9·1]; hazard ratio 0·785 [95% CI 0·617‒0·998], p=0·048). 387 patients (257 in the apatinib group and 130 in the placebo group) had a safety assessment after study treatment and were included in safety analyses. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were hypertension (71 [28%] patients in the apatinib group vs three [2%] in the placebo group), hand–foot syndrome (46 [18%] vs none), and decreased platelet count (34 [13%] vs one [1%]). 24 (9%) patients in the apatinib group and 13 (10%) in the placebo group died due to adverse events, but none of these deaths were deemed to be related to treatment by investigators.

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2021","2021","32",,"S217",,"1 Jul 2021","Background: Tislelizumab, an investigational monoclonal antibody with high affinity and binding specificity for PD-1, was engineered to minimize binding of FcyR on macrophages to help abrogate antibody-dependent phagocytosis, a mechanism of T-cell clearance and potential resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Two early phase studies (NCT02407990, CTR20160872) demonstrated that single-agent tislelizumab (200 mg) administered intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) was generally well tolerated and showed preliminary antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: This global Phase 2 study (NCT03419897) examined single-agent tislelizumab (200 mg IV Q3W) in patients with unresectable HCC with Child-Pugh A and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B/C who had received at least one prior line of systemic therapy. The primary endpoint was overall response rate by independent review committee (IRC) (ORR IRC) per RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival by IRC (PFS IRC), ORR per investigator (ORR INV), duration of response (DoR), overall survival (OS), and the safety/tolerability profile of tislelizumab. Results: As of Aug 2019, 249 patients (median age 62 years) were enrolled. At study entry, 225 (90%) patients had BCLC stage C and 200 (80%) had extrahepatic spread; 111 (45%) patients had received ≥2 prior systemic therapies and 233 (94%) had received prior sorafenib. Across the study population, confirmed ORR IRC was 12.4% (95% CI: 8.6, 17.2) with 2 complete responses (CR) and 29 partial responses (PR); ORR INV was 14.1% (95% CI: 10, 19.0) with 1 CR and 34 PRs. With a median study follow-up of 9.1 months, DoR IRC was not reached (NR). Median OS and PFS IRC were 12.4 months (95% CI: 10.8, NR) and 2.7 months (95% CI: 1.5, 2.8), respectively; the 1-year OS rate was 51.9% (95% CI: 44, 59). Number of prior lines of therapy did not impact response (1 prior line, ORR IRC = 13.0% [95% CI: 7.9, 19.8]; ≥2 prior lines, ORR IRC =11.7% [95% CI: 6.4, 19.2]) or survival estimates (1 prior line, median OS=13.0 months [95% CI: 10.5, NR], median PFS=2.6 months [95% CI: 1.4, 2.8]; ≥2 prior lines, median OS=11.8 months [95% CI: 10.6, NR], median PFS=2.7 months [95% CI: 1.4, 2.8]). The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were increased AST (n=30; 12%) and ALT (n=2; 9%); increased AST (n=6; 2%) was the only grade 3–4 TRAE occurring in ≥2% of patients. Two patients had fatal AEs (infectious pneumonia, hepatic encephalopathy; n=1 each); neither was attributed to treatment by investigator. Conclusions: Tislelizumab demonstrated durable responses and was well tolerated in patients with previously systemically treated unresectable HCC, a patient population with a continued high unmet medical need.

In the absence of head-to-head comparison studies, population-adjustment can be used to compare the efficacy between two different drugs in the same setting of patients. We report here a MAIC of second-line MKI options for patients with HCC previously treated with sorafenib using individual real-world data of regorafenib and aggregate data of second-line cabozantinib from the CELESTIAL trial. Methods: Data from 278 patients who received regorafenib as second-line therapy after sorafenib failure for unresectable HCC were used as IPD. Data inclusion were adapted to those reported in the CELESTIAL trial in the subset of patients who received sorafenib as the only prior therapy. Survival medians and rates were obtained from Kaplan–Meier curves, and differences between regorafenib and cabozantinib groups were explored through Cox regression adjusted for weights originating from MAIC. Results: The median OS of the weighted regorafenib group was 11.1 months (IQR: 5.6 – 16.4) and 11.3 (IQR: 6.7–22.4) for cabozantinib; HR 0.83 (95%C.I.:0.62–1.09).

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2021","2021","32",,"S127",,"1 Jul 2021","Background: The management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is hampered by the presence of underlying liver disease and until recently, multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were the only available drugs to treat HCC. However, their use was often limited in clinical practice due to the adverse effects profile and the potential to deteriorate baseline liver function. For this unmet need, the FDA approved nivolumab as a second-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh (C-P) liver function score ≤ B, who progressed to or did not tolerate TKIs. Although the phase III clinical trial did not achieve its primary endpoint, partial and durable responses were seen. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the safety profile of nivolumab in HCC in a real-world setting. Methods: This was a retrospective and multicenter study of patients with advanced HCC treated with nivolumab between January 2017 and December 2020 in 5 tertiary hospitals. Results: Twenty-six patients were included, with a median age of 60 years old (61-24 years). Chronic liver disease was due to alcohol in 12 patients (44%), HCV infection in 6 (22%), and HCV and HBV co-infection in 3 (11%). Cirrhosis was present in 17 patients (65%), portal hypertension stigma in 13 (48%), and extra-hepatic involvement in 10 (37%). According to C-P score, at the start of nivolumab, 19 (73%) and 7 (27%) patients were A and B score, respectively. Sorafenib was the first line in 23 patients (88%) and nivolumab in 3 (12%). Regarding second-line treatment, nivolumab was an option in 17 patients (74%) and regorafenib in 6 (26%). Six patients started a third line with nivolumab, 5 with an C-P score A. Under CTCAE, 22 treatment-related adverse events were seen in 16 patients (59%), 3 grade 3 (14%), and 1 grade 4 (bleeding) event. The most common adverse events were asthenia, hepatic, and endocrine toxicity. Toxicity leading to definitive suspension was seen in 6 patients (1 bleeding event, 1 hepatic toxicity, 1 heart failure, and 2 with grade 2 persistent asthenia). Disease control was achieved in 9 patients (37%), with 1 partial response. In the first-, second- and third-line setting, the median time to progression from the start of immunotherapy was 22 [21-67], 23 [2–138], and 9 weeks [1-19], respectively. Fifteen deaths (58%) were observed, 9 in second- and 4 in third- line. The median overall survival (OS) was 101 [36-178], 182 [121–188], and 195 weeks [87-209], for the first, second-, and third-line treatment. A C-P score of A at the start of nivolumab was related to superior OS (P=0.014). The median follow-up time was 159 weeks, with 6 patients receiving nivolumab at the end of the study, 2 in the third-line setting. One patient had no disease progression one year after suspension of treatment. Conclusions: The survival of patients with advanced HCC treated with nivolumab was related to C-P score at the start of treatment. Nivolumab is an option to consider with a favorable safety profile consistent with previous reports. Prospective studies are warranted.

The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of an online continuing educational activity on the knowledge of oncologists regarding the rationale behind using immunotherapy combination strategies and the latest clinical trial data investigating immunotherapy combination regimens for the frontline treatment of patients with unresectable HCC and their clinical implications. Methods: This educational activity consisted of a 20-minute expert commentary with synchronized slides summarizing the presentations from a Medscape Live Virtual Townhall in July 2020. The effectiveness of education was assessed with a repeated-pairs pre-/post-assessment study design using 3 knowledge questions and 1 confidence question, in which each individual served as his/her own control. A paired samples t-test assessed mean differences in average number of correct responses pre- to post-assessment, and a McNemar’s test assessed significance of improvement in the percentage of correct responses to single questions from pre- to post-assessment. P values <.05 were statistically significant. The activity launched on August 17, 2020, with data collected through December 18, 2020 being reported in the current study.

The average knowledge of oncologists, measured as a percentage of correct responses to the knowledge questions, increased from 66% pre- to 78% post-education, and the improvement in overall knowledge of oncologists was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Around 8% of oncologists improved and 79% reinforced (confirmed) their knowledge regarding the rationale behind using immunotherapy combination strategies for the treatment of unresectable HCC, with 88% knowing this information post-education (P=0.527) Furthermore, there was an improvement in the following areas of knowledge related to: - The latest clinical trial data of the phase III IMbrave150 study (pre 74%, post 92%, P < 0.01) - The latest clinical trial data of the phase Ib KEYNOTE-524 study (pre 38%, post 55%, P < 0.01) In addition, as a result of the education, 48% of the oncologists had a measurable improvement in their confidence regarding understanding the clinical implications of the recent clinical trial data related to frontline immunotherapy combination therapies for the patient with unresectable HCC, resulting in 41% of oncologists being mostly or very confident after the education. Conclusions: This study analysis demonstrated that an online education consisting of a 20-minute expert commentary with synchronized slides summarizing the presentations from a Medscape Live Virtual Townhall effectively improved the knowledge and confidence of oncologists regarding the latest clinical trial data investigating immunotherapy combination regimens for the frontline treatment of patients with unresectable HCC and their clinical implications.

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2021","2021","22","7","977","990","1 Jul 2021","Background: China has a high burden of hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the main causative factor. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have a poor prognosis and a substantial unmet clinical need. The phase 2–3 ORIENT-32 study aimed to assess sintilimab (a PD-1 inhibitor) plus IBI305, a bevacizumab biosimilar, versus sorafenib as a first-line treatment for unresectable HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: This randomised, open-label, phase 2–3 study was done at 50 clinical sites in China. Patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically diagnosed or clinically confirmed unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, no previous systemic treatment, and a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible for inclusion. In the phase 2 part of the study, patients received intravenous sintilimab (200 mg every 3 weeks) plus intravenous IBI305 (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). In the phase 3 part, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either sintilimab plus IBI305 (sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group) or sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily; sorafenib group), until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was done using permuted block randomisation, with a block size of six, via an interactive web response system, and stratified by macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis, baseline α-fetoprotein, and ECOG performance status. The primary endpoint of the phase 2 part of the study was safety, assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The co-primary endpoints of the phase 3 part of the study were overall survival and independent radiological review committee (IRRC)-assessed progression-free survival according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03794440. The study is closed to new participants and follow-up is ongoing for long-term outcomes. Findings: Between Feb 11, 2019 and Jan 15, 2020, we enrolled 595 patients: 24 were enrolled directly into the phase 2 safety run-in and 571 were randomly assigned to sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar (n=380) or sorafenib (n=191). In the phase 2 part of the trial, 24 patients received at least one dose of the study drug, with an objective response rate of 25·0% (95% CI 9·8–46·7). Based on the preliminary safety and activity data of the phase 2 part, in which grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events occurred in seven (29%) of 24 patients, the randomised phase 3 part was started. At data cutoff (Aug 15, 2020), the median follow-up was 10·0 months (IQR 8·5–11·7) in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group and 10·0 months (8·4–11·7) in the sorafenib group. Patients in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group had a significantly longer IRRC-assessed median progression-free survival (4·6 months [95% CI 4·1–5·7]) than did patients in the sorafenib group (2·8 months [2·7–3·2]; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·56, 95% CI 0·46–0·70; p<0·0001). In the first interim analysis of overall survival, sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar showed a significantly longer overall survival than did sorafenib (median not reached [95% CI not reached–not reached] vs 10·4 months [8·5–not reached]; HR 0·57, 95% CI 0·43–0·75; p<0·0001). The most common grade 3–4 treatment-emergent adverse events were hypertension (55 [14%] of 380 patients in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group vs 11 [6%] of 185 patients in the sorafenib group) and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (none vs 22 [12%]). 123 (32%) patients in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group and 36 (19%) patients in the sorafenib group had serious adverse events. Treatment-related adverse events that led to death occurred in six (2%) patients in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group (one patient with abnormal liver function, one patient with both hepatic failure and gastrointestinal haemorrhage, one patient with interstitial lung disease, one patient with both hepatic faliure and hyperkalemia, one patient with upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and one patient with intestinal volvulus) and two (1%) patients in the sorafenib group (one patient with gastrointestinal haemorrhage and one patient with death of unknown cause). Interpretation: Sintilimab plus IBI305 showed a significant overall survival and progression-free survival benefit versus sorafenib in the first-line setting for Chinese patients with unresectable, HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma, with an acceptable safety profile. This combination regimen could provide a novel treatment option for such patients. Funding: Innovent Biologics.

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2021","2021","22","7","991","1001","1 Jul 2021","Background: Understanding patients' experience of cancer treatment is important. We aimed to evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in the IMbrave150 trial, which has already shown significant overall survival and progression-free survival benefits with this combination therapy. Methods: We did an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial in 111 hospitals and cancer centres across 17 countries or regions. We included patients aged 18 years or older with systemic, treatment-naive, histologically, cytologically, or clinically confirmed unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, with disease that was not amenable to curative surgical or locoregional therapies, or progressive disease after surgical or locoregional therapies. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1; using permuted block randomisation [blocks of six], stratified by geographical region; macrovascular invasion, extrahepatic spread, or both; baseline alpha-fetoprotein concentration; and ECOG performance status) to receive 1200 mg atezolizumab plus 15 mg/kg bevacizumab intravenously once every 3 weeks or 400 mg sorafenib orally twice a day, until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity. The independent review facility for tumour assessment was masked to the treatment allocation. Previously reported coprimary endpoints were overall survival and independently assessed progression-free survival per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1. Prespecified secondary and exploratory analyses descriptively evaluated treatment effects on patient-reported quality of life, functioning, and disease symptoms per the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality-of-life questionnaire for cancer (QLQ-C30) and quality-of-life questionnaire for hepatocellular carcinoma (QLQ-HCC18). Time to confirmed deterioration of PROs was analysed in the intention-to-treat population; all other analyses were done in the PRO-evaluable population (patients who had a baseline PRO assessment and at least one assessment after baseline). The trial is ongoing; enrolment is closed. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03434379. Findings: Between March 15, 2018, and Jan 30, 2019, 725 patients were screened and 501 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (n=336) or sorafenib (n=165). 309 patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 145 patients in the sorafenib group were included in the PRO-evaluable population. At data cutoff (Aug 29, 2019) the median follow-up was 8·6 months (IQR 6·2–10·8). EORTC QLQ-C30 completion rates were 90% or greater for 23 of 24 treatment cycles in both groups (range 88–100% in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 80–100% in the sorafenib group). EORTC QLQ-HCC18 completion rates were 90% or greater for 20 of 24 cycles in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group (range 88–100%) and 21 of 24 cycles in the sorafenib group (range 89–100%). Compared with sorafenib, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab reduced the risk of deterioration on all EORTC QLQ-C30 generic cancer symptom scales that were prespecified for analysis (appetite loss [hazard ratio (HR) 0·57, 95% CI 0·40–0·81], diarrhoea [0·23, 0·16–0·34], fatigue [0·61, 0·46–0·81], pain [0·46, 0·34–0·62]), and two of three EORTC QLQ-HCC18 disease-specific symptom scales that were prespecified for analysis (fatigue [0·60, 0·45–0·80] and pain [0·65, 0·46–0·92], but not jaundice [0·76, 0·55–1·07]). At day 1 of treatment cycle five (after which attrition in the sorafenib group was more than 50%), the mean EORTC QLQ-C30 score changes from baseline in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sorafenib groups were: –3·29 (SD 17·56) versus –5·83 (20·63) for quality of life, –4·02 (19·42) versus –9·76 (21·33) for role functioning, and –3·77 (12·82) versus –7·60 (15·54) for physical functioning. Interpretation: Prespecified analyses of PRO data showed clinically meaningful benefits in terms of patient-reported quality of life, functioning, and disease symptoms with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab compared with sorafenib, strengthening the combination therapy's positive benefit–risk profile versus that of sorafenib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2021","2021","9","13",,,"1 Jul 2021","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most lethal cancer types despite great advancement in overall survival of the patients over the last decades. Surgical resection or partial hepatectomy has been approved as the curative treatment for early-stage HCC patients however only up to 30% of them are eligible for the procedures. Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes recognized for killing virally infected cells and improving immune functions for defending the body against malignant cells. Although autologous NK cells failed to demonstrate significant clinical benefit, transfer of allogeneic adoptive NK cells arises as a promising approach for the treatment of solid tumors. The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and inadequate homing efficiency of NK cells to tumors can inhibit adoptive transfer immunotherapy (ATI) efficacy. However, potential of the NK cells is challenged by the transfection efficiency. The local ablation techniques that employ thermal or chemical energy have been investigated for the destruction of solid tumors for three decades and demonstrated promising benefits for individuals not eligible for surgical resection or partial hepatectomy. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is one of the most recent minimally invasive ablation methods that destruct the cell within the targeted region through non-thermal energy. IRE destroys the tumor cell membrane by delivering high-frequency electrical energy in short pulses and overcomes tumor immunosuppression. The previous studies demonstrated that IRE can induce immune changes which can facilitate activation of specific immune responses and improve transfection efficiency. In this review paper, we have discussed the mechanism of NK cell immunotherapy and IRE ablation methods for the treatment of HCC patients and the combinatorial benefits of NK cell immunotherapy and IRE ablation.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00769106, NCT00909558, NCT01078415, NCT01147380, NCT01749865, NCT02008929, NCT02010801, NCT02332551, NCT02352935, NCT02399735, NCT02562963, NCT02568748, NCT02725996, NCT02787954, NCT02828865, NCT02839954, NCT02854839, NCT03040453, NCT03319459, NCT03515252, NCT03592706, NCT03841110, NCT04106167, NCT04162158, NCT04404647, NCT04420026)",,,L2013660779,10.21037/atm-21-539

Methods: IMbrave150, a global, randomized, open-label, phase 3 study in patients with systemic treatment-naive unresectable HCC, included an extension phase that enrolled additional patients from mainland China. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive intravenous atezolizumab 1,200 mg plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg once every 3 weeks or sorafenib 400 mg twice a day until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit. Co-primary endpoints were OS and independent review facility-assessed PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 in the intention-to-treat population. Results: Of 194 Chinese patients enrolled from April 16, 2018, to April 8, 2019 (137 in the global study and 57 in the China extension phase), 133 received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and 61 received sorafenib.

We report safety and efficacy data of an international, multicenter, real-life cohort of patients with advanced HCC treated with cabozantinib. Methods: Patients with HCC who were treated with cabozantinib were retrospectively identified across 11 centers in Austria, Switzerland, and Germany. Patients' characteristics, adverse events, duration of treatment and overall survival (OS) data were analyzed until April 1, 2020. Results: Eighty-eight patients from 11 centers were included. The predominant underlying liver diseases were NAFLD/NASH in 26 (30%) and hepatitis C infection in 21 (24%) patients. Seventy-eight patients (89%) were classified as Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage C. Sixty patients (68%) were Child-Pugh A, whereas 22 (25%) were Child-Pugh B, respectively. Cabozantinib was used as systemic second- and third-line or later treatment in 41 (47%) and 46 (52%) patients, respectively. The following best responses under cabozantinib were documented: partial response in 6 (7%), stable disease in 28 (32%), and progressive disease in 28 (32%) patients, respectively. Fifty-two patients (59%) died during follow-up. The median OS from start of cabozantinib treatment was 7.0 months in the entire cohort and 9.7 months in Child-Pugh A patients, while Child-Pugh B patients had a median OS of 3.4 months, respectively. Thirty-seven (42%) patients fulfilled the CELESTIAL inclusion and exclusion criteria, showing a median OS of 11.1 months. Most common adverse events were fatigue (15.6%) and diarrhea (15.6%).

As an antiviral drug, TDF has been proposed in the first-line treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Qingzhong, a brand name of TDF, commercialized by Jiangsu Chia-tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Co Ltd., and Viread, another brand name of TDF, commercialized by GlaxoSmithKline, have both been approved by the State Food and Drug Administration, China. AIM To investigate the efficacy and safety of the two TDF agents in the treatment of Chinese CHB patients. METHODS This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier number of NCT02287857. A total of 330 Chinese CHB patients, among which 232 were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive, were included in this 5-year-long, multicenter, double-blinded, double-dummy, randomized-controlled, non-inferiority phase III trial. The participants were initially randomized into two groups: Group A (n = 161), in which the participants received 300 mg Qingzhong once a day for 48 wk; and Group B, in which the participants received 300 mg Viread once a day for 48 wk. Starting from week 49, all the participants in Groups A and B received 300 mg Qingzhong once a day until the 96th week. In this study, the primary endpoint was the decrease in plasma level of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA at the 96th week, while the secondary endpoints were suppression of HBV replication, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization, HBeAg loss, and HBeAg seroconversion rates. RESULTS For the participants with HBeAg-positive CHB, the decrease in mean HBV DNA level relative to the baseline value was comparable between Groups A and B (5.77 vs 5.73 log10 IU/mL, P > 0.05) at the 96th week. In addition, similar percentages of HBeAg-positive participants in the two groups exhibited undetectable levels of HBV DNA, HBeAg loss, and HBeAg seroconversion (71.05% vs 77.97%, 31.00% vs 27.27%, and 20.22% vs 15.79%, respectively, in Group A vs Group B; P > 0.05). For the participants with HBeAg-negative CHB, the decrease in mean HBV DNA level relative to the baseline value was also comparable between Groups A and B (4.46 vs 4.70 log10 IU/mL, P > 0.05) at the 96th week. In addition, similar percentages of HBeAg-negative participants in the two groups exhibited undetectable levels of HBV DNA (87.23% vs 94.12% in Group A vs Group B, respectively; P > 0.05). Finally, similar percentages of CHB patients (HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative) in the two groups exhibited normalization of ALT (80.14% vs 84.57% in Group A vs Group B, respectively; P > 0.05), and similar incidences of adverse events were observed (106 vs 104 in Group A vs Group B, respectively; P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Both Qingzhong and Viread are effective and safe in the treatment of Chinese CHB patients according to the results of our clinical trial.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02287857)",,,L2013005855,10.12998/wjcc.v9.i18.4690

The liver has unique properties that facilitate metastatic expansion, including a complex immune system that evolved to dampen immunity to neoantigens entering the liver from the gut, through the portal circulation. In this review, we describe the unique microenvironment encountered by cancer cells in the liver, focusing on elements of the innate and adaptive immune response that can act as a double-edge sword, contributing to the elimination of cancer cells on the one hand and promoting their survival and growth, on the other. We discuss this microenvironment in a clinical context, particularly for colorectal carcinoma, and highlight how a better understanding of the role of the microenvironment has spurred an intense effort to develop novel and innovative strategies for targeting liver metastatic disease, some of which are currently being tested in the clinic.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02376699, NCT02423343, NCT02671435, NCT02777710, NCT02907099, NCT02953782, NCT03123783, NCT03184870, NCT03631407, NCT03642067, NCT03697564, NCT03744468, NCT03834948, NCT04031872, NCT04140500, NCT04301778)",,32526354,L2006803931,10.1016/j.semcancer.2020.06.003

Ascites is common in HCC and is associated with poorer outcomes. This exploratory, pooled meta-analysis of patients with baseline α-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥400 ng/ml investigated outcomes by treatment-emergent (TE) ascites in REACH and REACH-2. Methods: A pooled meta-analysis of independent patient data for participants (N = 542) with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/ml (stratified by study) from REACH and REACH-2 was carried out. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated by Kaplan–Meier estimator, and OS further assessed by Cox models. The effect of TE ascites on OS was evaluated by multivariate Cox models. Results: Treatment-emergent ascites developed in 66 patients (20.9%) in the ramucirumab group and 33 patients (14.8%) in the placebo group.

Based on phase 2 study (Study 202) results, body weight-based dosing for lenvatinib was used in REFLECT to minimize dose disruptions and modifications needed to address dose-related adverse events. This post hoc analysis of REFLECT data assessed lenvatinib efficacy and safety by body weight group. Methods: The study randomly administered lenvatinib (n = 476) or sorafenib (n = 475) to patients with untreated (no prior systemic therapy) uHCC. Lenvatinib starting-dose data were stratified by body weight: patients weighing < 60 kg received 8 mg/day; patients weighing ≥ 60 kg received 12 mg/day. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate, and safety were assessed. Results: Survival outcomes and safety profiles appeared similar between the two body-weight-based lenvatinib starting-dose groups. Median OS for patients in the < 60 kg body weight group (n = 153) was 13.4 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.5–15.7] compared to 13.7 months (95% CI 12.0–15.6) in the ≥ 60 kg body weight group (n = 325). In both lenvatinib groups, PFS was 7.4 months (< 60 kg group: 95% CI 5.4–9.2; ≥ 60 kg group: 95% CI 6.9–9.0).

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2021","2021","3","3",,,"1 Jun 2021","Background & Aims: Aramchol is a fatty acid-bile acid conjugate that reduces liver fat content and is being evaluated in a phase III clinical trial for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Aramchol attenuates NASH in mouse models and decreases steatosis by downregulating the fatty acid synthetic enzyme stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) in hepatocytes. Although hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) also store lipids as retinyl esters, the impact of Aramchol in this cell type is unknown. Methods: We investigated the effects of Aramchol on a human HSC line (LX-2), primary human HSCs (phHSCs), and primary human hepatocytes (phHeps). Results: In LX-2 and phHSCs, 10 μM Aramchol significantly reduced SCD1 mRNA while inducing PPARG (PPARγ) mRNA, with parallel changes in the 2 proteins; ACTA2, COL1A1, β-PDGFR (bPDGFR) mRNAs were also significantly reduced in LX-2. Secretion of collagen 1 (Col1α1) was inhibited by 10 μM Aramchol. SCD1 knockdown in LX-2 cells phenocopied the effect of Aramchol by reducing fibrogenesis, and addition of Aramchol to these cells did not rescue fibrogenic gene expression. Conversely, in LX-2 overexpressing SCD1, Aramchol no longer suppressed fibrogenic gene expression. The drug also induced genes in LX-2 that promote cholesterol efflux and inhibited ACAT2, which catalyses cholesterol synthesis. In phHeps, Aramchol also reduced SCD1 and increased PPARG mRNA expression. Conclusions: Aramchol downregulates SCD1 and elevates PPARG in HSCs, reducing COL1A1 and ACTA2 mRNAs and COL1A1 secretion. These data suggest a direct inhibitory effect of Aramchol in HSCs through SCD1 inhibition, as part of a broader impact on both fibrogenic genes as well as mediators of cholesterol homeostasis. These findings illustrate novel mechanisms of Aramchol activity, including potential antifibrotic activity in patients with NASH and fibrosis. Lay summary: In this study, we have explored the potential activity of Aramchol, a drug currently in clinical trials for fatty liver disease, in blocking fibrosis, or scarring, by hepatic stellate cells, the principal collagen-producing (i.e. fibrogenic) cell type in liver injury. In both isolated human hepatic stellate cells and in a human hepatic stellate cell line, the drug suppresses the key fat-producing enzyme, stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), which leads to reduced expression of genes and proteins associated with hepatic fibrosis, while inducing the protective gene, PPARγ. The drug loses activity when SCD1 is already reduced by gene knockdown, reinforcing the idea that inhibition of SCD1 is a main mode of activity for Aramchol. These findings strengthen the rationale for testing Aramchol in patients with NASH.",,,,L2011452046,10.1016/j.jhepr.2021.100237

However, whether the price of the combination could be affordable is unknown. The current study assessed the cost-effectiveness of the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab as first-line systemic therapy for patients with unresectable HCC from the Chinese and American payers' perspective. Methods: A Markov model was built based on a global, multicentre, open-label, phase III randomized trial (IMbrave150, NCT03434379) that included three states of the patient's health: stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD) and death. Data for all medical costs were acquired from the Red Book, published literature and West China Hospital. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were the primary outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the model uncertainty. Results: The treatment consisting of a combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab yielded an additional 0.53 QALYs compared with sorafenib alone, leading to an ICER of $145,546.21 per QALY in China and $168,030.21 per QALY in the USA, both beyond the willing-to-pay threshold ($28,527.00/QALY in China and $150,000.00 /QALY in the USA).

Methods: We compared available guidelines on the clinical management of cholangiocarcinoma in the United States and Europe, which included the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) and the International Liver Cancer Association (ILCA) guidelines. Results: There is discordance in the recommendation for biopsy in patients with potentially resectable cholangiocarcinoma and in the recommendation for use of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans. Similarly, the recommendation for preoperative biliary drainage for extrahepatic and perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in the setting of jaundice is inconsistent across all four guidelines. The BILCAP (capecitabine) and ABC-02 trials (gemcitabine with cisplatin) have provided the strongest evidence for systemic therapy in the adjuvant and palliative settings, respectively, but all guidelines have refrained from setting them as standard of care, given heterogeneity in the study cohorts and ABC-02’s negative intention-to-treat results.

Prognosis is poor, and until recently sorafenib was the only treatment option available for patients with unresectable disease. Lenvatinib is the first therapy to demonstrate noninferiority to sorafenib. An analysis was conducted using clinical data from Japanese patients in the phase III REFLECT trial to assess the cost-effectiveness of lenvatinib versus sorafenib for first-line treatment of unresectable HCC in Japan. Methods: A partitioned survival model was implemented adopting the perspective of the Japanese healthcare system, with costs and outcomes modeled over a lifetime horizon and using a discount rate of 2%, as per Japanese guidelines. Population data from the Japanese subpopulation of REFLECT were used to extrapolate outcomes, and costs and resource use were based on Japanese sources. The Japanese tariff was applied to EQ-5D data collected during the REFLECT clinical trial to obtain utility values reflecting the preferences of the Japanese population. Results: Compared with sorafenib, lenvatinib is dominant because it is associated with a reduction in incremental costs of ¥156 799 and incremental quality-adjusted life-years of 0.31. These results were robust to changes in key assumptions, and probabilistic outcomes aligned with deterministic outcomes.

This matching-adjusted indirect comparison evaluated the efficacy and safety of both drugs after sorafenib in patients with HCC and AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. Methods: Individual patient data (IPD) from the CELESTIAL trial (cabozantinib) and population-level data from the REACH-2 trial (ramucirumab) were used. To align with REACH-2, the CELESTIAL population was limited to patients who received first-line sorafenib only and had baseline serum AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. The IPD from CELESTIAL were weighted to balance the distribution of 11 effect-modifying baseline characteristics with those of REACH-2. Overall survival (OS; primary endpoint) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared for the CELESTIAL (matching-adjusted) and REACH-2 populations using weighted Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and parametric (OS, Weibull; PFS, log-logistic) modeling. Rates of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and TRAE-related discontinuations were also compared. Results: After matching and weighting, baseline characteristics were balanced between populations (REACH-2, N = 292; CELESTIAL, effective sample size = 105). Weighted KM estimates for OS (median [95% CI]) were not significantly different between cabozantinib and ramucirumab (10.6 [9.5–17.3] months versus 8.7 [7.3–10.8] months; p = 0.104), but PFS was significantly longer for cabozantinib than for ramucirumab (5.5 [4.6–7.4] months versus 2.8 [2.7–4.1] months; p = 0.016). Parametric modeling results were consistent with the weighted KM analysis. Rates of some grade 3 or 4 TRAEs were lower with ramucirumab than with cabozantinib; however, TRAE-related discontinuation rates were similar (p = 0.271). Conclusion: In this MAIC, cabozantinib significantly prolonged median PFS compared with ramucirumab after prior sorafenib treatment in patients with HCC and AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL; rates of some grade 3 or 4 TRAEs were lower with ramucirumab than cabozantinib but related discontinuation rates were not significantly different between treatments.

Date of Publication: 1 May 2021","2021","104",,,,"1 May 2021","Background/Aims: The development of decompensation in cirrhosis demarcates a marked change in the natural history of chronic liver disease. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) exert pleiotropic effects that reduce inflammation and fibrosis as well as improve vascular reactivity. Retrospective studies uniformly have associated statin utilization with improved outcomes for patients with cirrhosis. Prospective human studies have shown that statins reduce portal hypertension and reduce death in patients with decompensated cirrhosis after variceal hemorrhage when added to standard therapy with an acceptable safety profile. This proposal aims to extend these findings to demonstrate that simvastatin reduces incident hepatic decompensation events among cirrhotic patients at high risk for hepatic decompensation. Methods: We will perform the SACRED Trial (NCT03654053), a phase III, prospective, multi-center, double-blind, randomized clinical trial at 11 VA Medical Centers. Patients with compensated cirrhosis with clinically significant portal hypertension will be stratified based upon the concomitant use of nonselective beta-blockers and randomized to simvastatin 40 mg/day versus placebo for up to 24 months. Patients will be observed for the development of hepatic decompensation (variceal hemorrhage, ascites, encephalopathy), hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-related death, death from any cause, and/or complications of statin therapy. Ancillary studies will evaluate patient-reported outcomes and pharmacogenetic corollaries of safety and/or efficacy. Conclusion: Statins have a long track-record of safety and tolerability. This class of medications is generic and inexpensive, and thus, if the hypothesis is proven, there will be few barriers to widespread acceptance of the role of statins to prevent decompensation in patients with compensated cirrhosis.

Date of Publication: 1 May 2021","2021","32","5","S55",,"1 May 2021","Purpose: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer in the world and third, in cancer related mortality. Only 20% HCC are early HCCs that are eligible for therapies such as resection, liver transplantation, and local ablation due to advanced stage, tumor burden, lack of liver donors and liver dysfunction. The majority of HCCs are treated with palliative therapy, which includes Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and systemic therapy, while transarterial radioembolization still struggles to find a place in evidence-based treatment. In this study we explore the advances made in systemic therapy for advanced HCC, especially since the approval of sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, including the evolution and emerging field of immunotherapy in the last decade through relevant literature. Materials and Methods: We reviewed recently published studies in PubMed and data presented in the last decade discussing both advances and failures in the systemic treatment of HCC. Results: After Sorafenib demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) in SHARP and Asia Pacific trials over placebo many other phase III trials have been conducted with other multi kinase inhibitors like sunitinib, brivanib and linifanib; none of which yielded significant results compared to sorafenib. Lenvatinib has been approved as first-line therapy for advanced HCC due to increased response rate, progression free similar survival outcomes like sorafenib. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors Regorafenib and Cabozantinib have shown significant improvement in survival, in RESORCE and CELESTIAL trials, respectively, as second-line treatment after sorafenib failures, radiological progression or intolerance in patients. Ramucirumab an anti VEGF monoclonal IgG antibody, studied in REACH trial demonstrated a potential survival benefit for patients with AFP ≥ 400ng/dL and Immune checkpoint inhibitors, like nivolumab and pembrolizumab although showing promising response rates and minimal adverse effects in phase II trial failed to demonstrate an improved OS in phase III trial. Despite clinical trials where combination of TACE and molecular targeted agents have failed till date, combination of TACE with sorafenib indicated success in TACTICS trial and the outcome of various ongoing combination trials with molecular targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors is eagerly awaited. Conclusions: While a lot of progress has been made in increasing survival of patients with advanced HCC, the ongoing trials will further change the treatment paradigm significantly for HCC.",,,,L2011773836,10.1016/j.jvir.2021.03.130

There is an unmet medical need for standard-of-care adjuvant therapy to prevent disease recurrence and improve overall survival. Pembrolizumab, a programmed death receptor-1 blocking antibody, has shown evidence of a favorable benefit-to-risk profile in the adjuvant setting in many tumor types but has not been investigated in HCC. KEYNOTE-937 (NCT03867084) will evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab versus placebo as adjuvant therapy in patients with HCC who had a complete radiologic response after surgical resection or local ablation. Materials and Methods: KEYNOTE-937 is a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study. Adults with confirmed HCC, complete radiologic response after surgical resection or local ablation, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, and class A Child-Pugh score are eligible. Patients with past or ongoing hepatitis C or controlled hepatitis B virus infection may be enrolled if they meet prespecified criteria. Patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously or placebo intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 17 cycles or until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal, stratified by geographic region, prior local therapy (resection vs ablation), recurrence risk, and alpha-fetoprotein level at diagnosis. Coprimary end points are recurrence-free survival and overall survival; secondary end points are safety and tolerability (graded per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0) and health-related quality of life; and exploratory end points include distant metastases-free survival; time to recurrence; and genomic, metabolic, and/or proteomic biomarkers.

Despite the significant tumor responses that can be achieved with TACE, tumors commonly recur, progress, or are refractory. Clinical trials have explored the combination of TACE with tyrosine kinase inhibitors; however, these have not reported improved outcomes. HCC possesses a unique immunosuppressive microenvironment, which makes it an attractive target for immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, there is evidence that locoregional interventions induce changes in the immune environment that could promote synergy with checkpoint inhibitors. Preliminary data for the combination of TACE with nivolumab indicate an acceptable safety profile and promising efficacy. NIVO monotherapy and NIVO + IPI combination therapy are both approved in the United States for patients with HCC previously treated with sorafenib. Together, these findings support investigation of TACE plus NIVO, IPI, or NIVO + IPI to address the therapeutic needs of patients with intermediate HCC. Materials and Methods: CheckMate 74W is a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm, randomized phase 3 trial. Patients with tumors that exceed the Beyond Milan and Up-to-7 criteria (7 being the sum of size [in centimeters] and number of tumors), eligible for TACE, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1 are eligible for enrollment.

Several biomarkers, including GALAD (a panelincluding gender, age, AFP, AFP-L3%, and DCP), have promising data in phase II casecontrolstudies; however, cohort data are critical prior to adoption in clinical practice. Ouraim was to conduct a biomarker validation study evaluating GALAD for early HCC detectionin a large cohort of patients with cirrhosis. Methods: We leveraged a prospective cohort ofpatients with Child Pugh A or B cirrhosis who were enrolled between 2004-2006 and thenfollowed every 6 months until incident HCC, liver transplantation, death, or lost to followup.Patients underwent HCC surveillance using imaging +/- AFP every 6 months, with HCCdiagnosed per AASLD criteria. Serum and plasma were collected at every visit and storedat -80C (without interval thawing). As recommended by the Early Detection ResearchNetwork, we used a prospective specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation(PRoBE) design for biomarker evaluation to detect HCC at an early stage (i.e. within MilanCriteria.) Biomarker performance was compared using patient-level true positive rate (i.e.,sensitivity), defined as the proportion of positive results within 6 months of diagnosis amongHCC cases, with screening-level false positive rate fixed at 10%. Results: Of 408 eligiblecirrhosis patients, 43 patients developed HCC (52.4% early stage) over a median of 3.5years. Median age was 52.6 years, 59.5% were male, and 47.5% had HCV infection. Thetrue positive rate of GALAD to detect any stage HCC was 72.0% (95%CI 52.4 – 89.5%),which was higher than that of AFP (52.0%, 95%CI 30.4 – 75.0%), AFP-L3 (43.8%, 95%CI34.6 – 81.8%), and DCP (20%, 95%CI 5.6 – 38.5%). Similarly, true-positive rate of GALADfor early-stage HCC was 72.2% (95%CI 50.0 – 91.7%), which was higher than AFP alone(66.7%, 95%CI 41.2 – 88.9%), AFP-L3 (33.3%, 95%CI 21.7 – 82.4%), and DCP (22.2%,95%CI 5.0 – 42.9%). Results were consistent in subgroup analyses by viral vs. non-viraletiologies. As expected, true positive rate of GALAD to detect HCC was lower when assessedmore than 6 months prior to HCC diagnosis (50.0% for any stage HCC, 44.4% for earlystageHCC).

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an important driver of HCC. Immunotherapy has been approved for treating HCC, but biomarker-based stratification of patients for optimal response to therapy is an unmet need(6,7). Here we report the progressive accumulation of exhausted, unconventionally activated CD8(+)PD1(+) T cells in NASH-affected livers. In preclinical models of NASH-induced HCC, therapeutic immunotherapy targeted at programmed death-1 (PD1) expanded activated CD8(+)PD1(+) T cells within tumours but did not lead to tumour regression, which indicates that tumour immune surveillance was impaired. When given prophylactically, anti-PD1 treatment led to an increase in the incidence of NASH–HCC and in the number and size of tumour nodules, which correlated with increased hepatic CD8(+)PD1(+)CXCR6(+), TOX(+), and TNF(+) T cells. The increase in HCC triggered by anti-PD1 treatment was prevented by depletion of CD8(+) T cells or TNF neutralization, suggesting that CD8(+) T cells help to induce NASH–HCC, rather than invigorating or executing immune surveillance. We found similar phenotypic and functional profiles in hepatic CD8(+)PD1(+) T cells from humans with NAFLD or NASH. A meta-analysis of three randomized phase III clinical trials that tested inhibitors of PDL1 (programmed death-ligand 1) or PD1 in more than 1,600 patients with advanced HCC revealed that immune therapy did not improve survival in patients with non-viral HCC. In two additional cohorts, patients with NASH-driven HCC who received anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 treatment showed reduced overall survival compared to patients with other aetiologies. Collectively, these data show that non-viral HCC, and particularly NASH–HCC, might be less responsive to immunotherapy, probably owing to NASH-related aberrant T cell activation causing tissue damage that leads to impaired immune surveillance. Our data provide a rationale for stratification of patients with HCC according to underlying aetiology in studies of immunotherapy as a primary or adjuvant treatment.",,,33762733,L2010896463,10.1038/s41586-021-03362-0

Methods: Serum AFP was measured at baseline and every three cycles. The prognostic and predictive value of baseline AFP was assessed by Cox regression models and Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot method. Associations between AFP (≥ 20% increase) and radiographic progression and efficacy were assessed. Results: Baseline AFP was confirmed as a continuous (REACH, REACH-2; p < 0.0001) and dichotomous (≥400 vs. <400 ng/ml; REACH, p < 0.01) prognostic factor, and was predictive for ramucirumab survival benefit in REACH (p = 0.0042 continuous; p < 0.0001 dichotomous). Time to AFP (hazard ratio [HR] 0.513; p < 0.0001) and radiographic (HR 0.549; p < 0.0001) progression favoured ramucirumab. Association between AFP and radiographic progression was shown for up to 6 (odds ratio [OR] 5.1; p < 0.0001) and 6–12 weeks (OR 1.8; p = 0.0065).

This review article seeks to provide clarity on the complex and evolving landscape of clinical trials on systemic treatments of HCC. It covers current trials which test various systemic treatments (i) in the first and second line in advanced HCC, (ii) in intermediate HCC, (iii) as adjuvant as well as (iv) neoadjuvant strategies, and (v) including immune interventions other than immune checkpoint inhibition.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02905188, NCT03071094, NCT03298451, NCT03299946, NCT03319459, NCT03337841, NCT03347292, NCT03383458, NCT03412773, NCT03630640, NCT03713593, NCT03755791, NCT03764293, NCT03778957, NCT03841110, NCT03847428, NCT03867084, NCT03941873, NCT03980288, NCT04011033, NCT04039607, NCT04102098, NCT04170556, NCT04183088, NCT04246177, NCT04310709, NCT04340193, NCT04425226, NCT04442581, NCT04777851, NCT04803994)",,,L2006985208,10.3390/cancers13081962

Here, immune checkpoint modulating drugs alone or in combination with local ablative techniques could open a new and attractive therapeutic “door” to improve outcome and response rate for patients with HCC. Methods: Published data on HCC experimental to pre-(clinical) treatment strategies from standard of care to novel immunomodulatory concepts were summarized and discussed in detail. Results: Overall, our knowledge of the role of immune checkpoints in HCC is dramatically increased in the last years. Experimental and pre-clinical findings could be translated to phase 1 and 2 clinical trials and became standard of care. Local ablative techniques of HCC could improve the effectivity of immune checkpoint inhibitors in situ. Conclusions: This review demonstrates the importance of immunomodulatory treatment strategies of HCC, whereby the “best treatment code” of immune checkpoint drugs, combination with ablative techniques and of timing must be evaluated in coming clinical trials.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02519348, NCT03538028, NCT03753659, NCT03849469, NCT03867084, NCT04220944, NCT04268888, NCT04273100, NCT04374877, NCT04406623, NCT04518852, NCT04567615, NCT04658147)",,,L2006838195,10.3390/cancers13071558

Although surgery is the primary curative treatment, most patients at diagnosis are not surgical candidates and are treated with liver-directed therapy and or systemic therapy. Over the past decade, the systemic treatment options for patients with advanced HCC have evolved. This paper reviews recent progress in systemic therapy and the results of major clinical trials involving novel compounds in patients with HCC. A literature search was performed using keywords related to HCC and systemic therapy. The evidence shows that at the present time an effective adjuvant systemic therapy is not available for patients with early-stage HCC following surgery. In patients with advanced HCC, in addition to sorafenib at least four other targeted agents and several immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination have been shown to be associated with improved progression-free and overall survival. The optimal sequence of agents, is currently not known, and is determined by patient characteristics, toxicities profile, patients and physicians preference. The future identification of novel active agents and predictive biomarkers are vital to personalize systemic therapy in HCC.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02562755, NCT02650271, NCT03298451, NCT03383458, NCT03412773, NCT03500848, NCT03713593, NCT03755791, NCT03778957, NCT03794440, NCT03847428, NCT03859128, NCT03950518, NCT04039607, NCT04053972, NCT04102098, NCT04168944, NCT04237740, NCT04246177, NCT04268888, NCT04316182, NCT04319484, NCT04340193, NCT04392700)",,34756361,L2008369196,10.1016/j.dld.2020.10.005

In this post hoc analysis, we assessed prognosis in terms of survival by baseline ALBI grade and monitored liver function during treatment with ramucirumab or placebo using the ALBI score in patients with advanced HCC. Methods: Patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh class A with prior sorafenib treatment were randomised in REACH trials to receive ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo every 2 weeks. Data were analysed by trial and as a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data (pooled population) from REACH (alpha-fetoprotein ≥400 ng/ml) and REACH-2. Patients from REACH with Child-Pugh class B were analysed as a separate cohort. The ALBI grades and scores were calculated at baseline and before each treatment cycle. Results: Baseline characteristics by ALBI grade were balanced between treatment arms among patients in the pooled population (ALBI-1, n = 231; ALBI-2, n = 296; ALBI-3, n = 7). Baseline ALBI grade was prognostic for overall survival (OS; ALBI grade 2 vs. 1; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.38 [1.13–1.69]), after adjusting for other significant prognostic factors. Mean ALBI scores remained stable in both treatment arms compared with baseline and were unaffected by baseline ALBI grade, macrovascular invasion, tumour response, geographical region, or prior locoregional therapy. Baseline ALBI grades 2 and 3 were associated with increased incidence of liver-specific adverse events and discontinuation rates in both treatments. Ramucirumab improved OS in patients with baseline ALBI grade 1 (HR 0.605 [0.445–0.824]) and ALBI grade 2 (HR 0.814 [0.630–1.051]). Conclusions: Compared with placebo, ramucirumab did not negatively impact liver function and improved survival irrespective of baseline ALBI grade. Lay summary: Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Prognosis is affected by many clinical factors including liver function both before and during anticancer treatment. Here we have used a validated approach to assess liver function using 2 laboratory parameters, serum albumin and bilirubin (ALBI), both before and during treatment with ramucirumab in 2 phase III placebo-controlled studies. We confirm the practicality of using this more simplistic approach in assessing liver function prior to and during anticancer therapy, and demonstrate ramucirumab did not impair liver function when compared with placebo.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01140347, NCT02435433)",,,L2010451520,10.1016/j.jhepr.2020.100215

Application of a recognized value framework to published studies could objectively compare the potential benefit across available therapies. MATERIALS AND METHODS An umbrella review of phase III trials for HCC therapies was performed. ASCO Value Framework Net Health Benefit Score version 2 (ASCO-NHB v2) scores, the primary analysis, and European Society of Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale version 1.1 scores, the secondary analysis, were computed using selected drug registration trials. Both scores were compared between drugs that were Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved by 2020 and those that were not. RESULTS Of the 22 studies identified, nine were FDA-approved and 13 were not. Across 22 trials, the median overall survival (OS) was 9.2 months (range, 1.9-16.4 months), with a median gain of 0.35 month (range, 2.3-3.3 months). HCC therapies that were FDA-approved showed longer OS (median 10.7 v 7.9 months, P, .01) and higher ASCO NHB scores (118.4 v 25.7 scores, P, .01). The median gain in OS was 2.2 months in the approved treatments compared with 20.3 months in the unapproved group, with no difference in progression-free survival between the two groups. CONCLUSION The nine FDA-approved therapies for HCC have higher mean NHB score than those that were not FDA-approved.

However, the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors is limited due to tumor heterogeneity, high tumor burden, and “cold” tumor microenvironment. Radiotherapy can improve the anti-tumor effects of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in various ways. As a new radiotherapy method, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) provides higher doses per fraction to the target lesions, thus achieving immune activation effects and overcoming tumor resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, which significantly improves the local and distant control of tumors. However, for different metastatic situations, radiotherapy plays different roles in the combination therapy. In oligometastatic status, radiotherapy can be used as a local radical treatment aiming to eliminate cancers in cooperation with systemic PD-1 inhibitors. In other circumstances, like bulky metastasis or multiple metastatic tumors, radiotherapy can be used as adjuvant to systemic immunotherapy. This review focuses on the underlying mechanisms and optimization strategies for the combination of radiotherapy and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in metastatic disease.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02303366, NCT0240081, NCT02599779, NCT02608385, NCT0282656, NCT02843165, NCT0299291, NCT03035890, NCT03087019, NCT03101475, NCT03115801, NCT03122496, NCT03220854, NCT03223155, NCT03224871, NCT03283605, NCT03436056, NCT0346494, NCT03474497, NCT0350958, NCT03548428, NCT0364482, NCT03812549, NCT03825510, NCT03867175, NCT03958383, NCT03988647, NCT04098432, NCT04106180, NCT04166734, NCT04167657, NCT04306926, NCT04361162, NCT04535024, NCT04547452, NCT04549428, NCT04625894)",,,L634739683,10.3389/fonc.2021.638873

PD-L1expression has increasingly emerged as a potential biomarker when predicting the immunotherapy-based efficacy; but regrettably, PD-L1 alone is not sufficient to differentiate patients. Other molecules, such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as well, are involved in further explorations.

The number of BTK inhibitors (BTKis) in the clinic has increased considerably and currently amounts to at least 22. First-in-class was ibrutinib, an irreversible binder forming a covalent bond to a cysteine in the catalytic region of the kinase, for which we have identified 228 active trials listed at ClinicalTrials.gov. Next-generation inhibitors, acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib, are approved both in the United States and in Europe, and zanubrutinib also in China, while tirabrutinib is currently only registered in Japan. In most cases, these compounds have been used for the treatment of B-lymphocyte tumors. However, an increasing number of trials instead addresses autoimmunity and inflammation in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, pemphigus and systemic lupus erythematosus with the use of either irreversibly binding inhibitors, e.g., evobrutinib and tolebrutinib, or reversibly binding inhibitors, like fenebrutinib. Adverse effects (AEs) have predominantly implicated inhibition of other kinases with a BTKi-binding cysteine in their catalytic domain. Analysis of the reported AEs suggests that ibrutinib-associated atrial fibrillation is caused by binding to ERBB2/HER2 and ERBB4/HER4. However, the binding pattern of BTKis to various additional kinases does not correlate with the common assumption that skin manifestations and diarrhoeas are off-target effects related to EGF receptor inhibition. Moreover, dermatological toxicities, diarrhoea, bleedings and invasive fungal infections often develop early after BTKi treatment initiation and subsequently subside. Conversely, cardiovascular AEs, like hypertension and various forms of heart disease, often persist.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01105247, NCT01109069, NCT01236391, NCT01500733, NCT01578707, NCT01578708, NCT01614821, NCT01659255, NCT01722487, NCT01724346, NCT01744691, NCT01886872, NCT02029443, NCT02195869, NCT02213926, NCT02337829, NCT02343120, NCT02457559, NCT02475681, NCT02477696, NCT02604511, NCT02717611, NCT02970318, NCT03053440, NCT03206918, NCT03206970, NCT03336333, NCT03580928, NCT03682705, NCT03701282, NCT03734016, NCT03824483)",,,L634597967,10.3389/fcell.2021.630942

Thus, for clarifying the total burden of NAFLD, it is crucial to assess all associated outcomes, including not only clinical and economic outcomes but also PROs. PROs are thought to reflect what is happening in one's daily life and is an important way patients and health-care professionals communicate. There are various instruments for the assessment of PROs.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of atezo–bev vs. sorafenib as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable HCC from the US payer perspective. Methods: Using data from the IMbrave 150, we developed a Markov model to compare the lifetime cost and efficacy of atezo–bev as first-line systemic therapy in HCC with those of sorafenib. The main outcomes were life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results: Atezo–bev demonstrated a gain of 0.44 QALYs, with an additional cost of USD 79,074. The ICER of atezo–bev was USD 179,729 per QALY when compared with sorafenib. The model was most sensitive to the overall survival hazard ratio and body weight. If we assumed that all patients at the end of the IMbrave 150 trial were cured of HCC, atezo–bev was cost-effective (ICER USD 53,854 per QALY). However, if all patients followed the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, the ICER of atezo–bev was USD 385,857 per QALY. Reducing the price of atezo–bev by 20% and 29% would satisfy the USD 150,000/QALY and 100,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. Moreover, capping the duration of therapy to ≤12 months or reducing the dosage of bev to ≤10 mg/kg would render atezo–bev cost-effective. Conclusions: The long-term effectiveness of atezo–bev is a critical but uncertain determinant of its cost-effectiveness. Price reduction would favorably influence cost-effectiveness, even if long-term clinical outcomes were modest.

We compared the outcomes of PBT and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with recurrent/residual HCC (rHCC) in a phase III non-inferiority trial. Methods: Patients with rHCC (size <3 cm, number ≤2) were randomly assigned to receive PBT or RFA according to Child-Pugh score and tumor stage. After randomization, if the assigned treatment was technically infeasible, crossover was allowed. The primary endpoint was 2-year local progression-free survival (LPFS), with a non-inferiority margin of 15% in the per-protocol (PP) population; a complementary analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (NCT01963429). Results: The ITT population comprised 144 patients receiving either PBT (n = 72) or RFA (n = 72). Six patients switched from the PBT arm to the RFA arm and 19 patients switched from the RFA arm to the PBT arm. In the PP population, the 2-year LPFS rate with PBT (n = 80) vs. RFA (n = 56) was 94.8% vs. 83.9%, a difference of 10.9 percentage points (90% CI 1.8–20.0; p <0.001); in the ITT population, the 2-year LPFS rate with PBT vs. RFA was 92.8% vs. 83.2%, a difference of 9.6 percentage points (90% CI 0.7–18.4; p <0.001), meeting the criteria for non-inferiority. The 3- and 4-year LPFS rates for PBT were also non-inferior to those for RFA. The most common adverse events were radiation pneumonitis (32.5%) and decreased leukocyte counts (23.8%) for PBT and increased alanine aminotransferase levels (96.4%) and abdominal pain (30.4%) for RFA. No Grade 4 adverse events or mortality were noted. Conclusions: PBT showed LPFS values that were non-inferior to those for RFA; in addition, PBT was tolerable and safe. Clinical trial number: #NCT01963429 (ClinicalTrials.gov). Lay summary: Radiofrequency ablation is the standard of care for patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma in whom surgery is not feasible. This study is the first phase III randomized controlled trial to evaluate the clinical outcomes of proton beam radiotherapy vs. radiofrequency ablation in patients with recurrent small HCC. Our findings show that this new technique is not inferior and can be applied safely in patients with small recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01963429)",,33031846,L2010522340,10.1016/j.jhep.2020.09.026

Recommendations are graded in 3 categories according to the level of evidence of data found in the literature. Results: The diagnosis and staging of HCC is essentially based on clinical, biological and imaging features. A pathological analysis obtained by a biopsy of tumoral and non-tumoral liver is recommended. HCCs can be divided into 2 groups, taking into account not only the tumor stage, but also liver function. HCCs accessible to curative treatments are tumors that are in Milan criteria or with an AFP score ≤ 2, mainly treated by surgical resection, local ablation or liver transplantation. Intermediate and advanced HCCs with no liver insufficiency, accessible only to palliative treatments, benefit from TACE, SIRT or systemic therapy according to the presence or absence of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. Conclusion: Such recommendations are in permanent optimization and each individual case must be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert board.",,,33780876,L2011502827,10.1016/j.clinre.2020.101590

Among patients who are not eligible for liver transplant, removal of the tumor (resection or ablation) or localized chemotherapy (transarterial chemoembolization), the current gold standard in the UK is sorafenib and lenvatinib, which while efficacious has important adverse effects. Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) provides an alternative treatment option, that potentially avoids the serious adverse effects of systemic treatments and, for a small proportion of patients, may allow the patient to become eligible for either liver transplant or removal of the tumor. This study aimed to assess if SIRT is cost-effective, in other words, provides 'value for money' compared with sorafenib in selected patients with low tumor burden and good liver function. A cost-effectiveness model was built based on a Phase III randomized controlled trial, published studies and clinical surveys. The analyses showed that SIRT resulted in higher quality-adjusted life-years and lower or slightly higher healthcare cost depending on the selectiveness of the patient population, and thereby has the potential to be a cost-effective alternative to sorafenib.",,,33222542,L634306705,10.2217/fon-2020-1004

We assess patient characteristics, atezolizumab pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety by hepatic impairment status and region. METHODS: Atezolizumab was administered at 1,200 mg with 15 mg/kg of bevacizumab by IV infusion every 3 weeks. Sparse atezolizumab concentrations were evaluated by population PK and descriptive statistics. Safety assessment included the incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events. Hepatic impairment status was defined by NCI-ODWG criteria and regions included Asia versus rest-of- world. RESULTS: The dataset included 323 patients treated with atezolizumab+bevacizumab, of whom 123, 171, 27, and 2 had normal function, mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. For enrollment, 162 patients were from Asia and 161 were from rest-of- world. Patient characteristics were balanced between groups with a similar degree of hepatic impairment among regions. After comparing patients with mild hepatic impairment, or moderate hepatic impairment, versus patients with normal hepatic function, and after comparing patients in Asia versus rest-of- world, the geometric mean ratios for area under the concentration-time curve for atezolizumab for both Cycle 1 and steady-state ranged from 82-92%, 80-88%, and 125-147%, respectively. The safety profile of patients was similar across groups. CONCLUSION: Baseline characteristics reflect an unresectable HCC population with varying hepatic impairment among diverse regions. PK was well characterized with considerable overlap across groups. The treatment was well-tolerated with comparable safety across groups.

The influence of tumor microenviroment on cancer cells also results an essential driving force for cancer progression and drug resistance. Lipid-related enzymes, lipid-derived metabolites and/or signaling pathways linked to critical regulators of lipid metabolism can influence gene expression and chromatin remodeling, cellular differentiation, stress response pathways, or tumor microenviroment, and, collectively, drive tumor development. Reprograming of lipid metabolism includes a deregulated activity of mevalonate (MVA)/cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in specific cancer cells which, in comparison with normal cell counterparts, are dependent of the continuous availability of MVA/cholesterol-derived metabolites (i.e., sterols and non-sterol intermediates) for tumor development. Accordingly, there are increasing amount of data, from preclinical and epidemiological studies, that support an inverse association between the use of statins, potent inhibitors of MVA biosynthetic pathway, and mortality rate in specific cancers (e.g., colon, prostate, liver, breast, hematological malignances). In contrast, despite the tolerance and therapeutic efficacy shown by statins in cardiovascular disease, cancer treatment demands the use of relatively high doses of single statins for a prolonged period, thereby limiting this therapeutic strategy due to adverse effects. Clinically relevant, synergistic effects of tolerable doses of statins with conventional chemotherapy might enhance efficacy with lower doses of each drug and, probably, reduce adverse effects and resistance. In spite of that, clinical trials to identify combinatory therapies that improve therapeutic window are still a challenge. In the present review, we revisit molecular evidences showing that deregulated activity of MVA biosynthetic pathway has an essential role in oncogenesis and drug resistance, and the potential use of MVA pathway inhibitors to improve therapeutic window in cancer.",,,,L634440015,10.3389/fonc.2021.626971

However, to our knowledge, the cost-effectiveness of using this high-priced therapy for this indication is currently unknown. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab to treat unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma from the US payer perspective. Design, Setting, and Participants: This economic evaluation used a partitioned survival model consisting of 3 discrete health states to assess the cost-effectiveness of treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab vs sorafenib. The characteristics of patients in the model were similar to patients in a phase 3, open-label randomized clinical trial (IMbrave150) who had unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and had not previously received systemic treatment. Key clinical data were generated from the IMbrave150 trial conducted between March 15, 2018, and January 30, 2019, and cost and health preference data were collected from the literature. Main Outcomes and Measures: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-utility ratios, incremental net health benefits, and incremental net monetary benefits were calculated for the 2 treatment strategies. Subgroup, 1-way sensitivity, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab added 0.530 QALYs and resulted in an incremental cost of $89807 compared with sorafenib therapy, which had an incremental cost-utility ratio of $169223 per QALY gained. The incremental net health benefit was -0.068 QALYs, and the incremental net monetary benefit was -$10202 at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150000/QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that treatment with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab achieved a 35% probability of cost-effectiveness at a threshold of $150000/QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the results were most sensitive to the hazard ratio of overall survival. The subgroup analysis found that treatment with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was associated with preferred incremental net health benefits in several subgroups, including patients with hepatitis B and C. Conclusions and Relevance: Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment is unlikely to be a cost-effective option compared with sorafenib for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Reducing the prices of atezolizumab and bevacizumab may improve cost-effectiveness. The economic outcomes also may be improved by tailoring treatments based on individual patient factors.",,,33625508,L634316775,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.0037

A major contributing factor to this resistance is the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in GI cancers (e.g., colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, liver cancer). Non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), have been found to regulate several key targets that are responsible for cancer stemness, and function as oncogenic miRNAs (oncomiRs) or tumor suppressor miRNAs. As a result, several miRNAs have been found to alter, or be altered by, the expression of CSC-defining markers and their related pathways. These miRNAs can be utilized to affect stemness in multiple ways, including directly targeting CSCs and enhancing the efficacy of cancer therapeutics. This review highlights current studies regarding the roles of miRNAs in GI CSCs, and efforts towards the development of cancer therapeutics.",,,33562727,L2005958251,10.3390/ijms22041624

Although already funded by public payers, it is unknown whether it is economical to reimburse DAAs within the more advanced decompensated cirrhosis population. Methods: A state-transition model was developed to conduct a cost-utility analysis of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) plus ribavirin regimen for 12 weeks. The evaluated cohort had a mean age of 58 years and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class B cirrhosis with decompensated symptoms. A scenario analysis was performed on CTP C patients. We used a payer perspective, a lifetime time horizon and a 1.5% annual discount rate. Results: While SOF/VEL plus ribavirin treatment for 12 weeks increased costs by $156 676, it provided an extra 4.00 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to best supportive care (no DAA therapy). With an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $39 169 per QALY, SOF/VEL plus ribavirin was determined to be cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $50 000 per QALY. SOF/VEL reduced liver-related deaths and reduced progression to CTP C cirrhosis by 20.4% and 21.9%, respectively. On the contrary, SOF/VEL regimen resulted in increases in liver transplants and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by 54.0% and 42.5%, respectively. Similar results were found for CTP C patients. Conclusion: This analysis informs payers that SOF/VEL should continue to be reimbursed in decompensated hepatitis C patients. It also supports the recommendations by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases to continue screening for HCC in decompensated cirrhotic patients who have achieved sustained virologic response.",,,33065774,L2007396340,10.1111/jvh.13419

Herein, we assessed the existence and factors predictive of HPD in patients with advanced HCC treated with nivolumab. Methods: We enrolled 189 patients with advanced HCC treated with nivolumab. Occurrence of HPD was investigated using tumour growth dynamics based on tumour growth kinetics (TGK) and tumour growth rate (TGR) before and after treatment, or time to treatment failure. We additionally analysed patients treated with regorafenib (n = 95) or best supportive care (BSC)/placebo (n = 103) after progression on sorafenib to compare tumour growth dynamics. Results: Flare-up of tumour growth was observed in a fraction of patients upon PD-1 blockade, indicating the occurrence of HPD. Based on distinct patterns of disease progression exclusively observed in the nivolumab-treated cohort, but not in the regorafenib- or BSC/placebo-treated cohorts, 4-fold increases in TGK and TGR ratios as well as a 40% increase in TGR were the cut-off values used to define HPD; 12.7% of the patients (24/189) treated with nivolumab met all these criteria. Patients with HPD had worse progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 2.194; 95% CI 1.214–3.964) and overall survival (HR 2.238; 95% CI 1.233–4.062) compared to patients with progressive disease without HPD. More than 90% of patients with HPD missed the opportunity for subsequent treatment because of rapid clinical deterioration. An elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (>4.125) was associated with HPD and an inferior survival rate. Conclusions: HPD occurs in a fraction of patients with HCC who receive PD-1 inhibitor treatment. Analyses of the baseline immune profile and on-treatment tumour growth dynamics could enable optimal patient selection and earlier identification of HPD. Lay summary: Hyperprogressive disease is an unexpected response pattern observed in patients treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. This study revealed that hyperprogressive disease occurs in a fraction of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with an anti-PD-1 antibody, providing evidence to encourage careful monitoring of patients to prevent clinical deterioration induced by PD-1 blockade.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02715531, NCT03434379)",,32810553,L2010033957,10.1016/j.jhep.2020.08.010

Summary: The first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for advanced HCC, sorafenib, was approved in 2007. Regorafenib, the second drug, was approved 10 years later. Six additional drugs have been approved since. Targeted agents and checkpoint inhibitors are the only agents approved for systemic therapy of advanced HCC. Sorafenib and lenvatinib are approved as first-line agents, with regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab, nivolumab (used alone or with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab approved for patients who have received prior sorafenib therapy. Most patients in phase 3 studies had Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis, and data on the use of these agents in patients with more advanced hepatic dysfunction are limited. All of the targeted agents improve survival in patients with advanced disease. Median overall survival durations of up to 12.3 and 13.6 months were reported with use of sorafenib and lenvatinib, respectively, in phase 3 trials. Overall survival durations of 10.6, 10.2, and 9.2 months have been achieved with use of regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab as second-line therapy after sorafenib. A median overall survival of 13.2 months was reported in 1 cohort of a dose-expansion study of nivolumab in which all patients received prior sorafenib therapy. Median survival durations of 12.9 months and 13.9 months were reported with use of pembrolizumab in patients with a history of sorafenib therapy. The most common adverse effects associated with targeted agents are dermatological effects, diarrhea, fatigue, and hypertension. Immune-mediated adverse effects are associated with checkpoint inhibitors.

This review considers available phase III evidence on the use and sequencing of targeted therapy for intermediate and advanced non-locoregional therapy (LRT) eligible HCC and discusses implications for clinical practice. Methods: Published and presented literature on phase III data reporting on targeted therapy for advanced HCC that was not eligible for loco-regional therapies was identified using the key search terms ""hepatocellular cancer""AND ""advanced""AND ""targeted therapy""AND ""phase III""OR respective aliases (PRISMA). Results: Ten phase III trials assessed targeted therapy first-line and eight following sorafenib. In the first-line, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab statistically significantly improved overall survival (OS) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) compared with sorafenib, while lenvatinib demonstrated non-inferior OS. Following progression on sorafenib, statistically significant OS improvements over placebo were seen for cabozantinib and regorafenib in unselected patients and for ramucirumab in those with baseline α-fetoprotein≥400 ng/mL. Based on improved OS and PROs, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab appears to be a preferred first-line treatment option for intermediate or advanced non-LRT eligible HCC. Phase III data informing sequencing of later lines of treatment is lacking. Therefore, sequencing principles are proposed that can be used to guide treatment selection. Conclusions: Ongoing trials will continue to inform optimal therapy. Multiple targeted therapies have improved OS in intermediate or advanced non-LRT eligible HCC, although optimal sequencing is an area of ongoing investigation.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01004978, NCT01730937, NCT01906216, NCT02856126, NCT03298451, NCT03713593, NCT03755791, NCT03764293, NCT03775395, NCT03778957, NCT03794440, NCT03905967, NCT04039607, NCT04053985, NCT04103398, NCT04167293, NCT04194775, NCT04229355, NCT04246177, NCT04268888, NCT04340193, NCT04344158, NCT04387695)",,32898239,L2011825226,10.1093/jnci/djaa119

This concept has been extended to cancer pathology for cancer stem cells (CSCs) or cancer reprogramming. IGF-1R, a classical survival signaling, has been shown to regulate stem cell pluripotency, CSCs, or cancer reprogramming. The mechanism underlying such cell fate determination is unclear. We propose the determination is due to different niches in embryo development and tumor malignancy which modulate the consequences of IGF-1R signaling. Here we highlight the modulations of these niche parameters (hypoxia, inflammation, extracellular matrix), and the targeted stem cells (embryonic stem cells, germline stem cells, and mesenchymal stem cells) and CSCs, with relevance to cancer reprogramming. We organize known interaction between IGF-1R signaling and distinct niches in the double-sided cell fate with emerging trends highlighted. Based on these new insights, we propose that, through targeting IGF-1R signaling modulation, stem cell therapy and cancer stemness treatment can be further explored.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01042379, NCT01142388, NCT02306161, NCT03041701, NCT04129151, NCT04199026)",,,L633990952,10.3389/fcell.2020.625943

It often prospers where a chronic liver disease persists, thus leading a strong rationale for immune therapy. Several immune-based treatments, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), cytokines, adoptive cell transfer, and vaccines, have been tested in the treatment of HCC. In this review, we summarize the role of the ICI in HCC patients in various sets of treatment. As for advanced HCC, the anti-Programmed cell Death protein 1 (PD1) antibodies and the anti-Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibodies have been examined in patients with enthusiastic results in phase I-II-III studies. Overall, this led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and nivolumab + ipilimumab in the second-line setting. The anti- Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PDL-1) antibodies have also been evaluated. Thanks to the results obtained from phase III IMbrave study, atezolizumab + bevacizumab is now the standard of care in the first-line advanced setting of HCC. As for localized HCC, the putative immunological effect of locoregional therapies led to evaluate the combination strategy with ICI. This way, chemoembolization, ablation with radiofrequency, and radioembolization combined with ICI are currently under study. Likewise, the study of adjuvant immunotherapy following surgical resection is underway. In addition, the different ICI has been studied in combination with other ICI as well as with multikinase inhibitors and anti-angiogenesis monoclonal antibody. The evidence available suggests that combining systemic therapies and locoregional treatments with ICI may represent an effective strategy in this context.","ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov01008358, ClinicalTrials.gov01658878, ClinicalTrials.gov02325739, ClinicalTrials.gov02423343, ClinicalTrials.gov02517398, ClinicalTrials.gov02519348, ClinicalTrials.gov02572687, ClinicalTrials.gov02576509, ClinicalTrials.gov02702401, ClinicalTrials.gov02702414, ClinicalTrials.gov02715531, ClinicalTrials.gov02795429, ClinicalTrials.gov02821754, ClinicalTrials.gov02837029, ClinicalTrials.gov02942329, ClinicalTrials.gov02947165, ClinicalTrials.gov02988440, ClinicalTrials.gov03033446, ClinicalTrials.gov03092895, ClinicalTrials.gov03099564, ClinicalTrials.gov03143270, ClinicalTrials.gov03170960, ClinicalTrials.gov03211416, ClinicalTrials.gov03259867, ClinicalTrials.gov03289533, ClinicalTrials.gov03298451, ClinicalTrials.gov03316872, ClinicalTrials.gov03347292, ClinicalTrials.gov03380130, ClinicalTrials.gov03418922, ClinicalTrials.gov03434379, ClinicalTrials.gov03463876, ClinicalTrials.gov03475953, ClinicalTrials.gov03539822, ClinicalTrials.gov03572582, ClinicalTrials.gov03638141, ClinicalTrials.gov03655613, ClinicalTrials.gov03713593, ClinicalTrials.gov03753659, ClinicalTrials.gov03755791, ClinicalTrials.gov03764293, ClinicalTrials.gov03817736, ClinicalTrials.gov03841201, ClinicalTrials.gov03847428, ClinicalTrials.gov03857815, ClinicalTrials.gov03859128, ClinicalTrials.gov03864211, ClinicalTrials.gov03867084, ClinicalTrials.gov03869034, ClinicalTrials.gov03895970, ClinicalTrials.gov03939975, ClinicalTrials.gov03949231, ClinicalTrials.gov04102098, ClinicalTrials.gov04104074, ClinicalTrials.gov04116320, ClinicalTrials.gov04150744, ClinicalTrials.gov04165174, ClinicalTrials.gov04167293, ClinicalTrials.gov04191889, ClinicalTrials.gov04212221, ClinicalTrials.gov04220944, ClinicalTrials.gov04246177, ClinicalTrials.gov04273100, ClinicalTrials.gov04297280)",,,L633966748,10.3389/fonc.2020.601240

Systemic therapies are frequently used due to frequent recurrences after surgical or radiologic treatments. Anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in monotherapy, but with very low rates of long survival and exceptional recovery. Immuno-oncology based on immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the systemic therapies since showing long survival rates without any tumor progression or recurrence for some patients in partial or complete response, and possibly for some patients in stable disease. However, the rate of responders under immuno-oncology monotherapy is too low to increase significantly the median overall survival of the treated patients. The immuno-oncology-based combinations with different types of immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, ipilimumab, tremelimumab), or the association of immune checkpoint inhibitors plus anti-angiogenic agents (bevacizumab, lenvatinib, cabozantinib), have led to a breakthrough in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Indeed, the first phase-3 trial, combining atezolizumab with bevacizumab, has dramatically changed the outcome of patients.

In particular, after the approval of regorafenib, ramucirumab and cabozantinib, the landscape of second-line treatment has become notably complex, providing a serious challenge in clinical practice.

CELESTIAL is the only phase III study to have included patients in the third-line setting and cabozantinib efficacy was confirmed in several post hoc analyses, irrespective of alpha-fetoprotein levels, albumin-bilirubin score, age, and duration of previous sorafenib treatment. The safety profile of cabozantinib in the CELESTIAL trial was comparable with other multikinase inhibitors used for HCC and the most frequent grade ≥3 adverse events were diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, fatigue, hypertension, and aspartate aminotransferase increase. Tolerability did not differ between younger and older patients and quality of life was significantly improved compared to placebo during the treatment. In this review, we also make a particular mention to the use of cabozantinib in populations which are normally excluded from clinical trials, such as older patients and Child-Pugh B patients.

Regulation of angiogenesis in non-pathological conditions takes place through a well-defined balanced angiogenic-switch, which upon exposure to various pathological conditions may get altered. This makes the cells change their normal behavior resulting in uncontrolled division and angiogenesis. Methods: The current review tries to present a brief framework of angiogenesis and tumor progression phenomenon along with the latest therapeutic interventions against VEGFR-2 and its future directions. Results: The tumor angiogenic pathways functioning in diverse mechanisms via sprouting angiogenesis, intus-susceptive angiogenesis, vascular co-option, vascular mimicry, and glomeruloid angiogenesis are normally activated by varied angiogenic stimulators and their receptors are interrelated to give rise to specialized signaling pathways. Amongst these receptors, VEGFR-2 is found as one of the key, critical mediators in tumor angiogene-sis and is seen as a major therapeutic target for combating angiogenesis. Though a number of anti-angiogenic drugs like Ramucirumab, Sunitinib, Axitinib, Sorafenib, etc. showing good survival rates have been developed and approved by FDA against VEGFR-2, but these have also been found to be associated with serious health effects and adverse reactions. Conclusions: An improved or alternative treatment is needed shortly that has a higher survival rate with the least side effects. Innovative strategies, including personalized medicine, nano-medicine, and cancer im-munotherapy have also been outlined as an alternative treatment with a discussion on advancements and im-provements required for their implementation methods.",,,33076807,L2006887091,10.2174/1389200221666201019143252

During the past decade, this has been extensively explored in real-life settings, such as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2, Child- Pugh B liver function, chronic kidney disease, HIV infection, transplant recipients and the elderly. After 10 years, the multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib was approved in first-line setting. The Phase III REFLECT trial established the non-inferiority of lenvatinib compared with sorafenib in terms of overall survival, meanwhile exploratory analysis suggests a potential benefit over sorafenib for patients with HBV chronic infection and positive alpha-fetoprotein value. Experience with lenvatinib for patients not matching the REFLECT trial criteria remains promising but still retrospective. Indeed, the treatment sequence after lenvatinib still remains a crucial issue, considering that standard second-line options were tested only in patients who progressed to sorafenib. Overall, the choice between lenvatinib and sorafenib should take into account key selection criteria from randomized trials, evidence to date in special clinical situations, the physician’s experience and patient’s preference. Fast approval of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as first-line treatment for advanced HCC brought an additional element in this scenario. Undoubtedly, lenvatinib and sorafenib remain available options for patients who are not suitable or those progressed to combination immunotherapy.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex is a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism that integrates inputs from amino acids, nutrients, and extracellular signals. The mTOR protein is incorporated into two distinct complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Specifically, mTORC1 regulates protein synthesis, glucose and lipid metabolism, and autophagy, whereas mTORC2 promotes liver tumorigenesis through modulating the adenine/cytosine/guanine family of serine/threonine kinases, especially the protein kinase B proteins. In human HCC and iCCA samples, genomics analyses have revealed the frequent deregulation of the mTOR complexes. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the key role of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in liver-tumor development and progression. The first-generation mTOR inhibitors have been evaluated for effectiveness in liver-tumor treatment and have provided unsatisfactory results. Current research efforts are devoted to generating more efficacious mTOR inhibitors and identifying biomarkers for patient selection as well as for combination therapies. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the mechanisms leading to a deregulated mTOR signaling cascade in liver cancers, the mechanisms whereby the mTOR pathway contributes to HCC and iCCA molecular pathogenesis, the therapeutic strategies, and the challenges to effectively inhibit mTOR in liver-cancer treatment. Conclusion: Deregulated mTOR signaling significantly contributes to HCC and iCCA molecular pathogenesis. mTOR inhibitors, presumably administered in association with other drugs, might be effective against subsets of human liver tumors.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00321594, NCT00328770, NCT00355862, NCT00390195, NCT00467194, NCT00516165, NCT00775073, NCT00949949, NCT00973713, NCT00999882, NCT01005199, NCT01008917, NCT01010126, NCT01035229, NCT01177397, NCT01183663, NCT01251458, NCT01374750, NCT01488487, NCT01522820, NCT01567930, NCT01687673, NCT01888302, NCT02081755, NCT02145559, NCT02724332, NCT03500848)",,32394479,L2007487978,10.1002/hep.31310

Therefore, following the “miracle” outcomes seen in a few patients at the advanced stages of melanoma or lung cancer, the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) immediately entered clinical trials for advanced HCC patients without pre-clinical studies. Emerging data of clinical studies showed manageable toxicity and safety but limited therapeutic benefit to HCC patients, suggesting low response rate. Thus, one urgent issue is how to convert the liver tumors from cold to hot and responsive, which may rely on in-depth mechanistic studies in animal models and large scale data analysis in human patients. One ongoing approach is to design combinatorial treatment of different ICIs with other reagents and modalities. Indeed, a phase 3 clinical trial showed that combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab achieved better overall and progression-free survival rates than sorafenib in unresectable HCC.

Date of Publication: 2021","2021","13",,"5523","5533","2021","Purpose: The efficacy and safety of regorafenib have been demonstrated in phase 3 trials for multiple tumor types, including metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) (CORRECT [NCT01103323]; CONCUR [NCT01584830]), advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (GRID [NCT01271712]), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (RESORCE [NCT01774344]). The objective of this post hoc exploratory analysis was to explore the impact of regorafenib on delaying health-related quality of life (HRQOL) deterioration across these tumor types. Patients and Methods: HRQOL data (assessed with EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D questionnaires) were pooled for all trials to determine time until definitive deterioration (TUDD), defined as the patient’s first minimal clinically important deterioration in HRQOL score from baseline that does not resolve, using stratified Kaplan–Meier estimators and Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for relevant trial, cancer type, and baseline covariates. Additional analyses based on cancer type were conducted by pooling mCRC trials (CORRECT and CONCUR) and pooling the two mCRC trials with the HCC trial (RESORCE). Results: A total of 1699 patients with HRQOL data were pooled across the four trials. The results showed that regorafenib significantly delayed TUDD compared with placebo across all three tumor types. Median time to deterioration across the five scales ranged from 16.3 to 24.1 weeks for regorafenib and 8.6 to 12.1 weeks for placebo. The results from the individual studies, the pooled mCRC trials, and the pooled mCRC and HCC trials were similar to the overall pooled results. Conclusion: A pooled analysis of four phase 3 trials demonstrated that regorafenib delayed a clinically relevant exploratory endpoint, defined as TUDD, compared with placebo across three different tumor types (mCRC, GIST, and HCC), which supports a novel benefit of the impact of regorafenib with respect to patients with these three types of cancers by allowing initial declines in HRQOL to resolve and patients the opportunity to continue treatment.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01103323, NCT01271712, NCT01584830, NCT01774344)",,,L2007879336,10.2147/CMAR.S305939

However, these studies did not use personalised dosimetry. We aimed to compare the efficacy of a personalised versus standard dosimetry approach of selective internal radiation therapy with yttrium-90-loaded glass microspheres in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: DOSISPHERE-01 was a randomised, multicentre, open-label phase 2 trial done at four health-care centres in France. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older and had unresectable locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, at least one measurable lesion 7 cm or more in size, a hepatic reserve of at least 30% after selective internal radiation therapy, no extrahepatic spread (other than to the lymph nodes of the hilum, with a lesion <2 cm in size), and no contraindications to selective internal radiation therapy, as assessed by use of a technetium-99m macro-aggregated albumin scan. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a permutated block method, with block sizes of four and without stratification, to receive either standard dosimetry (120 ± 20 Gy) targeted to the perfused lobe; standard dosimetry group) or personalised dosimetry (≥205 Gy targeted to the index lesion; personalised dosimetry group). Investigators, patients, and study staff were not masked to treatment. The primary endpoint was the investigator-assessed objective response rate in the index lesion, according to European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria, at 3 months after selective internal radiation therapy in the modified intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one selective internal radiation therapy injection, and analysed on the basis of the treatment actually received (defined by central dosimetry assessment). The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02582034, and has been completed. Findings: Between Dec 5, 2015, and Jan 4, 2018, 93 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of these patients, 60 were randomly assigned: 31 to the personalised dosimetry group and 29 to the standard dosimetry group (intention-to-treat population). 56 (93%) patients (28 in each group) were treated (modified intention-to-treat population). In the modified intention-to-treat population, 20 (71% [95% CI 51–87]) of 28 patients in the personalised dosimetry group and ten (36% [19–56]) of 28 patients in the standard dosimetry group had an objective response (p=0·0074). In the safety analysis population, a least one serious adverse event was reported in seven (20%) of the 35 patients who received personalised dosimetry, and in seven (33%) of the 21 patients who received standard dosimetry. The most frequent (ie, occurring in >5% of patients) grade 3 or higher adverse events were ascites (one [3%] patient who received personalised dosimetry vs two [10%] patients who received standard dosimetry), hepatic failure (two [6%] vs none), lymphopenia (12 [34%] vs nine [43%]), increased aspartate aminotransferase concentrations (three [9%] vs two [10%]), increased alanine aminotransferase concentrations (three [9%] vs none), anaemia (two [6%] vs one [5%]), gastrointestinal haemorrhage (none vs two [10%]), and icterus (none vs two [10%]). One treatment-related death occurred in each group. Interpretation: Compared with standard dosimetry, personalised dosimetry significantly improved the objective response rate in patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The results of this study suggest that personalised dosimetry is likely to improve outcomes in clinical practice and should be used in future trials of selective internal radiation therapy.

Treatment with entecavir (ETV), tenofovir disoproxil (TDF) and the later released tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is highly effective at controlling hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and, in the vast majority of patients, is well tolerated. No significant differences in viral suppression have been described among the different regimens, although an earlier achievement in biochemical response has been suggested first under TDF and recently under TAF. High barrier to resistance NAs rarely achieve hepatitis B surface antigen sero-clearance, and therefore should be maintained life-long in most cases. This has increased concerns about treatment-related toxicity, especially in patients under TDF with additional risk factors for kidney and bone impairment. TAF has shown a better bone and kidney safety profile than TDF, although it is not yet available worldwide due to its higher cost. Emergence of adverse events should be monitored since treatment-switch to ETV/TAF seems to be effective and safe in HBV mono-infected subjects. Finally, although an effective antiviral treatment leads to a clear improvement in clinical outcome of CHB patients; the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not completely avoided with viral suppression. Whether tenofovir-based regimens provide any additional benefit over ETV in HCC prevention remains unclear and requires further investigation.",,,,L2010385005,10.1177/2049936120985954

Immune checkpoints are inhibitory regulators of the immune system and the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the treatment of other cancers has led to clinical trials investigating the use of ICIs alone or in combination with other therapies for liver cancers. Area covered: Clinical trials involving ICIs for the treatment of liver cancer were broadly reviewed. Hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were examined. Phase I/II trials were prioritized, and relevant phase III trials were discussed. MEDLINE, PubMed, ASCO meeting library, and Web of Science databases were searched with the keywords ‘immune checkpoint inhibitor’ or ‘targeted therapy’ in combination with ‘hepatocellular carcinoma,’ or ‘intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma’. Major outcomes were safety and efficacy defined by response rate, progression-free survival, or overall survival. Expert opinion: ICIs can improve progression-free and overall survival among patients with advanced disease with an acceptable safety profile. Given the heterogeneity of liver disease, ideal strategies will likely include a combination of ICIs with additional therapies to achieve the most robust and durable response. Additional biomarkers will be needed to guide combination therapy to personalize treatment regimen for patients with primary liver cancers.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01008358, NCT01264705, NCT01658878, NCT01693562, NCT01853618, NCT01938612, NCT02054806, NCT02407990, NCT02443324, NCT02519348, NCT02572687, NCT02576509, NCT02628067, NCT02699515, NCT02702401, NCT02702414, NCT02703714, NCT02715531, NCT02829918, NCT02837029, NCT02989922, NCT03006926, NCT03046862, NCT03092895, NCT03099564, NCT03101566, NCT03110328, NCT03143270, NCT03201458, NCT03222076, NCT03289533, NCT03299946, NCT03316872, NCT03380130, NCT03383458, NCT03397654, NCT03433898, NCT03434379, NCT03463876, NCT03510871, NCT03638141, NCT03655613, NCT03733990, NCT03778957, NCT03847428, NCT03859128, NCT03867084, NCT03895970, NCT03898895, NCT03937895, NCT04102098, NCT04246177, NCT04368078)",,34102935,L2012746282,10.1080/13543784.2021.1940948

We also collected the body of post-hoc analyses and meta-analyses to help guide the decision-making process in terms of patient selection and subsequent treatments. Expert opinion: Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab are the current standard of care for first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic HCC and treatment-naïve patient should be treated with the combination, unless contraindications to the drugs.

In recent years, several systemic therapy drugs including sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucicurab, nivilumab, and pembrolizumab have been approved by FDA for advanced HCC. However, their insufficient efficacy, toxicity, and drug resistance require clinically applicable and validated predictive biomarkers.

Alpha-fetoprotein, des-carboxyprothrombin, vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin-2, and dysregulated MTOR, VEGFR2, c-KIT, RAF1, PDGFRβ have the potential of proteomic/genomic biomarkers for sorafenib treatment. Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and albumin-bilirubin grade can predict the efficacy of other MKIs. Rb, p16, and Ki-67, and genes involved in cell cycle regulation, CDK1-4, CCND1, CDKN1A, and CDKN2A have been proposed for CD4/6 inhibitors, while dysregulated TERT, CTNNB1, TP53 FGF19, and TP53 are found to be predictors for ICI efficacy.

Its association with obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes supports the notion that NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. NAFLD, nowadays the most common cause of abnormal liver function tests, affects approximately 25% of the general population and includes a wide spectrum of liver disease, ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with the possibility of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this paper is to describe the therapeutic strategies contributing to the management of fatty liver disease in type 2 diabetes patients and the pathways these drugs interfere with to stop the development or even induce the regression of the liver disease. The progression of NAFLD to its various stages needs to be stopped. Besides insulin resistance, which is the main target in the therapeutic strategy, the ongoing studies provide new evidence on mechanisms that need to be interfered with to help deal with the metabolic syndrome components and improve the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Dietary changes and other lifestyle modification measures form the primary line of treatment. New molecules are currently developed for the management of NAFLD that act on various therapeutic targets, besides the anti-diabetic treatment.

In this sense, lenvatinib showed non-inferiority to sorafenib in terms of OS, and atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab is superior to sorafenib. For this reason, the combination therapy of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is currently the standard first-line treatment, and for the first-time immunotherapy has proven to be effective and safe in liver cancer. In the second-line, regorafenib, cabozantinib and ramucirumab were shown to be superior to placebo in phase III trials in patients who had received sorafenib as first-line treatment. Cabozantinib has also been shown to be superior to placebo in third-line; consequently, it is currently the only evidence-based third-line treatment. Immunotherapy as monotherapy has not been shown to be superior to sorafenib in first-line or placebo in second-line.

Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2021","2021","39","3 SUPPL",,,"1 Jan 2021","Background: Alliance/CALGB 80802, a randomized phase III trial, evaluated sorafenib plus doxorubicin vs. doxorubicin in pts with HCC and showed no improvement in median overall survival (OS) (HR[95CI] 1.05[0.83-1.31]) or PFS (HR[95CI] 0.93[0.75-1.16]). In HCC surrogacy of tumor response with OS remains controversial, in part due to varying criteria used for response evaluation (e.g., RECIST1.1 and mRECIST). We evaluated the performance of several models to predict OS using pretreatment clinical and radiomic variables. Methods: In CALBG 80802, we segmented all measurable tumor lesions on sequential CT scans. A lesion's imaging phenotype was deciphered with 23 uncorrelated quantitative imaging features measured at baseline and week (wk) 10 (first follow-up). An OS landmark survival analysis was conducted at wk 10. Patients were randomly assigned (3:1) to training (n = 92) and validation (n = 37) sets. In a training set, 6 random forest predictive models (6 signatures) used features that best predicted OS using 3 sets of variables: radiomics only (n = 23), clinical only (n = 9), radiomics and clinical (n = 32). Two time points (baseline only or baseline + wk 10) were assessed. Each signature's output was an individualized prediction and a continuous value ranging from 0 to 1 (from most to least favorable predicted OS). The primary endpoint was to compare these models' performance to predict OS using errorrate (Harrell's concordance-index) in the validation set. Results: Of the 6 training signatures evaluated, the one achieving the highest performance in the validation set was an 8-feature signature combining radiomics and clinical variables measured at two time points (baseline + wk 10) with an error rate of 35.6%. The variables [rank of importance] (table) selected by the signature included baseline clinical features (albumin[1], AFP[2], Child- Pugh[4]), baseline radiomics features (component 17[3], component 1[5], component 9[7], tumor volume[8]) and wk 10 radiomics features (delta tumor volume[6]). Variable delta tumor volume [6] used a more enhanced estimation of tumor burden at baseline and a delta tumor volumetric measurement; compared to RECIST1.1 measurement of percentage change in unidimensional measurement of a subset of target lesions. The four quartiles of the signature were significantly associated with OS (Log-Rank, P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The selected combined radiomic and clinical composite signature provided the best prediction for OS in the 80802 study patients' population. It is a suggested way forward to go beyond single anatomic measurement techniques such as RECIST or mRECIST.",,,,L634495921,10.1200/jco.2021.39.3_suppl.343
"Post hoc analysis in patients (pts)with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) who progressedto Child-Pugh B (CPB) liverfunction in the phase III REFLECT study of lenvatinib (LEN)","Huynh J., Cho M.T., Kim E.J.-H., Ren M., Robbins C., Amaya-Chanaga C., Vogel A.","Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021) 39:3 SUPPL. Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2021","2021","39","3 SUPPL",,,"1 Jan 2021","Background: The treatment landscape for pts with uHCC has recently expanded. However, there is an unmet need for effective treatment options in CPB pts. LEN is approved first-line in uHCC based on the REFLECT study (Child-Pugh A [CPA] pts were allowed, per inclusion criteria). In a prior analysis of REFLECT, pts treated with LEN benefited irrespective of baseline liver function (ALBI grade 1 or 2; Child-Pugh score 5 or 6). To determine outcomes in pts with reduced liver function, we report a post hoc analysis of key efficacy and safety results in LEN-treated pts from REFLECT who progressed to CPB and those who did not within the first 8 weeks of treatment. Methods: In REFLECT, pts with uHCC were randomized 1:1 to LEN (per bodyweight: 12 mg/day for ≥60 kg; 8 mg/day for < 60 kg) or sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) in 28-day cycles. This analysis assessed ORR. Landmark analyses (starting at week 8) of PFS, time-to-progression (TTP), and OS in CPB pts and in pts who remained CPA at 8 weeks postrandomization were also conducted. Tumors were assessed by mRECIST by independent imaging review. Safety was also assessed from baseline. Results: This subgroup analysis included LEN-treated pts (n = 60) who progressed to CPB within the first 8 weeks of treatment (CPB pts) and 413 pts who did not (CPA pts). At baseline, 26.7% and 73.1% of pts had an ALBI grade of 1 and 73.3% and 26.9% of pts had an ALBI grade of 2 in CPB and CPA pts, respectively. ORR was 28.3% (95% CI 16.9-39.7) for CPB pts and 42.9% (95% CI 38.1-47.6) for CPA pts. A landmark analysis showed a median PFS of 3.7 mos (95% CI 1.8-7.4) for CPB pts and 6.5 mos (95% CI 5.6-7.4) for CPA pts from the week 8 timepoint. Landmark analyses at week 8 also showed that the median TTP was 5.6 mos (95% CI 3.5-9.3) for CPB pts and 7.3 mos (95% CI 5.6-7.4) for CPA pts; the median OS was 6.8 mos (95% CI 2.6-10.3) for CPB pts and 13.3 mos (95% CI 11.6-16.1) for CPA pts per week 8 landmarkanalyses. As expected, efficacy appeared to be greater in CPA pts versus CPB pts; however, OS of 6.8 months in CPB pts after the week 8 landmark is notable. Moreover, median duration of treatment was 3.2 mos for CPB pts and 6.9 mos for CPA pts, thereby suggesting CPB pts can remain on LEN. The incidence of grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) was 71.7% in CPB pts and 54.7% in CPA pts. TRAEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 18.3% of CPB pts and 7.5% of CPA pts. Conclusions: In this post hoc analysis of pts in REFLECT, we examine the key efficacy and safety results for LEN-treated pts who progressed to CPB by week 8. This post hoc analysis is limited by its descriptive nature; however, the results indicate that further study of LEN in CPB pts with uHCC is warranted.",,,,L634496043,10.1200/JCO.2021.39.3-suppl.298

Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2021","2021","39","3 SUPPL",,,"1 Jan 2021","Background: Combined therapy of an immune checkpoint inhibitor with a targeted antiangiogenic agent had been proved to be effective for the treatment of uHCC. Penpulimab was engineered to eliminate FcγR binding and ADCC/ADCP completely, where ADCC/ADCP effects could induce T-cell apoptosis and clearance and then compromise anti-tumor activity. Penpulimab demonstrated a slower PD- 1 antigen binding off-rate, which resulted in better cellular activity and higher receptor occupancy. Penpulimab also showed numerous contacts with N58 glycosylation on the BC loop of PD-1 which could be an advantage to facilitate interaction of PD-1 antibody and might contribute to slower binding off-rate. These structural differentiations offer more robust biological effect and enhance anti-tumor activity of penpulimab. Anlotinib is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor selective for VEGF receptors 1/2/3, FGF receptors 1-4, PDGF receptors α and β, and c-kit. Methods: In this open-label, multicenter phase Ib/II study, patients (pts) without prior systemic treatment, and classified as BCLC stage B (not amenable for locoregional therapy) or C, Child-Pugh ≤7, and ECOG PS ≤ 1 received Penpulimab (200mg IV Q3W) and Anotinib (8 mg PO 2weeks on/1 week off). Primary endpoint was ORR (RECIST v1.1); secondary endpoints were safety, DCR, DoR, TTP, PFS and OS. Results: 31 pts (median age 56 years [23-74], ECOG 0/1 [64%/36%], BCLC B/C [23%/77%], HBV/HCV [61%/7%]) received combined therapy. As of August 31, 2020, median follow-up time was 11.9 mons (range 3.7-17.7). Median PFS was 7.6 mons with 6-mons PFS rate was 57.6% while median TTP was 8.5 mons with 6-mons TTP rate was 62.7%. Median overall survival had not been met and 6- mons OS rate was 93.2%. The ORR was 31.0% (9/29) and DCR was 82.8% (24/29). At data cutoff, 77.8% of responders remained ongoing and still on treatment. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 90.3% of pts (≥G3 in 16.1% [5/31], no G5, treatment discontinuation in 9.7% [3/31]). Most common TRAEs (≥15%) were increased AST (38.7%) and ALT (35.5%), increased blood bilirubin (22.6%),asthenia (22.6%),decreased platelet count (19.4%) and rash (16.1%). Conclusions: Penpulimab plus Anlotinib showed favorable antitumor efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in pts with uHCC.

Methods: Between February 2018 and October 2019, consecutive advanced HCC patients who received cabozatinib alone or in combination at University of Hong Kong Health System hospitals were analysed. Cabozantinib was administered at 60 mg continuously daily. Objective response rate (ORR), time-toprogression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and tolerability were evaluated. Results: Overall, 22 patients were included. The median age was 57.1 years (range 48.5-58.6). All patients except one were hepatitis B carriers. More than 80% of the patients had underlying Child-Pugh A cirrhosis. Most patients had metastatic disease (95.5%). More than 70% of patients received cabozantinib beyond second-line, and most of the patients had prior exposure to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and/or immunotherapy. The median time from the start of first-line systemic treatment to the start of cabozantinib was 11.2 months. Cabozantinib was administered to 11 patients (50%) as single agent, while the other half received cabozantinib in combination with mostly immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2021","2021","39","3 SUPPL",,,"1 Jan 2021","Background: Sorafenib was first approved by the US FDA to treat patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after two landmark trials (SHARP and Asia-Pacific) showed improved overall survival (OS). Since those two landmark trials, median OS has increased in the sorafenib arms in several recent phase III trials in HCC. We analyzed trends in OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rates (ORR) in published randomized clinical trials of sorafenib in HCC to better understand factors underlying the improvements. Methods: We searched PubMed for all published trials of sorafenib in advanced HCC. Trials were included if the patients were naïve to systemic therapy and had a comparison arm that was active systemic therapy or placebo. We extracted demographic and trial-level outcome data to correlate outcomes such as OS, PFS, ORR, and duration of therapy. T-tests were used to compare outcomes and linear regression was used to identify temporal trends with significance set at p£0.05. Results: The PubMed search returned 100 studies. A total of 15 studies met inclusion criteria with a total of 3755 patients treated with sorafenib (9 phase III and 6 phase II). Included trials enrolled patients from 2005-2019. The median OS in all trials was 10.0 mos (range: 6.5- 14.8 mos). OS has significantly improved since the first trial began accruing (p = 0.04). A total of 12 studies provided data on PFS using RECIST 1.1, with a median PFS of 4.0 months (range: 2.7-6.6 mos). PFS has not changed over time (p = 0.99). However, ORR assessed by RECIST 1.1 have trended toward improvement over time (p = 0.08). Median duration of therapy with sorafenib has decreased by 53% since the enrollment of the first clinical trial in 2005, from 23.1 weeks to 12.2 weeks (p = 0.02). Despite this, no significant correlations were observed with the interaction of duration of therapy and OS (p = 0.92). Further, there was no significant change in the age of patients included, proportion of patients with Childs-Pugh A, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) B, BCLC C, ECOG performance status 0, HBV or HCV, proportion of patients with extrahepatic spread or vascular invasion at time of enrollment, or proportion of patients who have undergone prior locoregional therapies to explain the OS findings. Conclusions: The OS of patients with advanced HCC on the sorafenib arm in published trials has been increasing, however the reasons for this increase are not apparent from data available in the published literature. At the same time, the median duration of treatment with sorafenib has been decreasing over time and PFS is unchanged, suggesting improvements in sorafenib delivery may not be the primary factor. It is possible these trends represent heretofore unquantified changes in patient selection for systemic therapy, improvements in supportive care, or postprogression treatment for patients on HCC clinical trials.",,,,L634496323,10.1200/jco.2021.39.3_suppl.327

Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2021","2021","39","3 SUPPL",,,"1 Jan 2021","Background: TACE is the most widely used locoregional therapy recommended for patients with intermediate-stage HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B). Despite the significant tumor responses that can be achieved with TACE, tumors commonly recur, progress, or are refractory. Clinical trials have explored the combination of TACE with tyrosine kinase inhibitors; however, these have not reported improved outcomes. HCC possesses a unique immunosuppressive microenvironment, which makes it an attractive target for immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, there is evidence that locoregional interventions induce changes in the immune environment that could promote synergy with checkpoint inhibitors. Preliminary data for the combination of TACE with nivolumab indicate an acceptable safety profile and promising efficacy (Harding et al. ASCO-GI 2020). NIVO monotherapy and NIVO+IPI combination therapy are both approved in the United States for patients with HCC previously treated with sorafenib. Together, these findings support investigation of TACE plus NIVO, IPI, or NIVO+IPI to address the therapeutic needs of patients with intermediate HCC. Methods: CheckMate 74W is a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3- arm, randomized phase III trial.

In the absence of head-to-head studies, indirect treatment comparison (ITC) is needed to compare the efficacy and safety of REG vs. CAB. Anchored MAIC is an ITC method adjusting for cross-trial heterogeneity using PBO as the common comparator or anchor. Methods: Patient-level data from RESORCE were available to match the inclusion criteria and published baseline characteristics of CELESTIAL. 2L patients with prior sorafenib exposure of >3 months were included in the analyses. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and Grade 3/4 treatment-emerging adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in > 10% of patients were compared. Matching was conducted for the following covariates, which were either imbalanced across trials or likely treatment effect modifiers (EMs): gender, region, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), prior sorafenib duration, extrahepatic spread, macrovascular invasion, hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), alcohol use, and alphafetoprotein (AFP) ≥400 ng/mL. Anchored MAIC were used to compare the relative effect of each treatment. To account for violation of the proportional hazards assumption, in addition to hazard ratios (HRs), restricted mean survival time (RMST) was estimated to quantify differences in OS and PFS. For safety, the relative effects were expressed as risk differences (RDs) (REG - CAB). Results: After matching, the effective sample sizes of REG and its PBO arm were 214 and 82, respectively. For OS, REG showed favorable although not statistically significant HR, and 30% longer mean survival with an RMST ratio approaching statistical significance. For PFS, there was no numerical difference in HR and no clinically meaningful difference based on RMST analyses (Table). REG showed lower incidence of diarrhea [RD of -7.1% (NE, NE)] and fatigue [RD of -6.3% (-14.6, 2.0)]. Conclusions: In this anchored MAIC, REG showed favorable OS and safety profile, especially for diarrhea and fatigue. No clinically meaningful difference was observed for PFS.

Therapeutic effect was determined using the RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST criteria. Progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and treatmentrelated adverse events (TRAE) were also evaluated. Results: Of 278 unresectable HCC patients (median age: 56.1±11.9 years), 220 (79.1%) had cirrhosis caused by HBV infection. 215 (77.3%) and 63 (22.7%) patients were classified as Child-pugh A and B class, respectively. 233 (83.8%) and 45 (16.2%) patients received lenvatinib in first-line and second-line systemic therapies, respectively. 223 (80.2%) patients were treated with lenvatinib plus arterially directed therapy (TACE or HAIC of FOLFOX) and 55 (19.8%) were treated with lenvatinib alone. The objective response rate were 34.9% (RECIST) and 47.5% (mRECIST), while the disease control rate were 75.5%.

Date of Publication: 2021","2021","39","15 SUPPL",,,"2021","Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer, comprising 90% of all cases. In the phase III IMbrave150 trial, combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab (atezo+bev) resulted in improved overall survival (OS) and progressionfree survival (PFS) compared with sorafenib for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). In the phase III REFLECT trial, lenvatinib met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority in OS versus sorafenib, and demonstrated superiority in secondary endpoints; PFS, time to progression and objective response rate (ORR). Furthermore, post-hoc analyses strongly suggest that the original non-inferiority trial likely underestimated the true effect of lenvatinib on OS due to imbalances in baseline prognostic covariates and the comparatively greater use of post-treatment anti-cancer therapies in the sorafenib arm. In the absence of a head-tohead comparison between atezo+bev and lenvatinib, the objective of this analysis was to estimate their comparative efficacy as first-line treatments for patients with uHCC. Methods: A network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted based on a de novo systematic literature review which identified evidence for licensed therapies in first-line uHCC. This was supplemented with data from the extended IMbrave150 study findings (clinical cut-off on 31 August 2020). Median hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (CrI) were estimated for OS and PFS. HRs for OS and PFS from REFLECT were taken from multivariable analyses which adjusted imbalances in baseline prognostic covariates. All analyses were conducted in a Bayesian generalised linear model framework. Model selection was based on deviance information criterion (DIC). Results: Four eligible phase III studies (REFLECT, SHARP, AsiaPac and IMbrave150) were included. Using a fixed-effects model, the estimated median HRs for atezo+bev compared with lenvatinib were 0.81 (95%CrI: 0.61, 1.08; posterior p=0.078) and 0.99 (95%CrI: 0.76, 1.28; posterior p=0.454) for OS and PFS, respectively. The results obtained were similar to those observed by Vogel et al, who reported an OS HR of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.32, 1.25), and a PFS HR of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.23, 3.65). Conclusions: While the NMA respects the randomization of the included studies, it does not represent direct evidence and should therefore be considered exploratory in nature. The results of this NMA suggest that the benefit of atezo+bev is not statistically significant compared to lenvatinib, as the differences between atezo+bev and lenvatinib fell within the Bayesian range of equivalence (upper limit of Crl ≥ 1 for OS and PFS) and were subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The results of the NMA were consistent for all the publicly available data cuts from IMbrave150.",,,,L635587696,10.1200/jco.2021.39.15_suppl.e16151

Key eligibility criteria are age ≥20 years, ECOG performance status 0-1, Child-Pugh A, no vascular invasion, no extrahepatic metastasis, beyond up-to-seven criteria, and patients who have received neither systemic therapy nor TACE. Patients will be administrated Atezo 1200 mg/body + Bev 15 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint is PFS per modified RECIST (mRECIST). The secondary endpoints include PFS, ORR, duration of response (DOR) per mRECIST; PFS, ORR, DOR per RECIST ver.1.1; OS and safety including change of liver function based on albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score until disease progression. A total of 60 events are necessary to investigate the hypothesis that a target point estimation of PFS rate at 6 months (null population: 55%, alternative population: 73%). The estimated sample size is, therefore, 70 patients. In addition, the results of the Atezo+Bev therapy in this arm will be compared with those in approximately 600 TACE treated consecutive patients with intermediate-stage HCC, using the propensity score matching method, as an exploratory analysis of a possible replacement of TACE by the Atezo+Bev therapy. Patients' enrollment had already started in December 2020, and 12 patients were enrolled as of 16th February '21.",,,,L635588140,10.1200/JCO.2021.39.15_suppl.TPS4162

Date of Publication: 2021","2021","39","15 SUPPL",,,"2021","Background: The multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor cabozantinib is approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in adults, who have previously been treated with sorafenib. In the pivotal phase 3 CELESTIAL trial a significant improvement for OS and PFS was shown for cabozantinib in comparison to placebo treated patients (Abou-Alfa GK et al. N Engl J Med 2018; 379:54-63). However, in 62% of patients a dose reduction of cabozantinib was necessary and the median average daily dose was 35.8 mg. The discontinuation rate due to treatmentrelated adverse events (TRAEs) was 16% and grade 3-4 TRAEs occurred in 68% of patients. For HCC patients treated with sorafenib in firstline, a reduced starting dose of 200 mg BID was not inferior in terms of OS but showed a trend toward a decreased rate of sorafenib discontinuation(Reiss KA et al. J Clin Oncol 2017; 35:3575-3581). The aim of the CaboRISE trial is to study the effect of a reduced starting dose of cabozantinib on tolerability, safety, and efficacy. Methods: The CaboRISE trial is an open-label, single arm, multicenter phase II trial, including patients with advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with compensated liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) in second line treatment, after first line treatment with sorafenib or lenvatinib. Forty evaluable patients will be enrolled in the study to receive a reduced starting dose of 40 mg cabozantinib once-daily for 4 weeks and subsequent dose escalation to 60 mg cabozantinib once-daily to be maintained until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. The objective of the trial is to assess the tolerability of a reduced starting dose of cabozantinib, in order to reduce the treatment discontinuation rates due to treatment-related adverse events below 10%. Primary endpoint is the treatment discontinuation rate due to TRAEs. Secondary endpoints are overall survival, progression free survival at 10 weeks, objective response rate, time on treatment, treatment exposure, toxicity, and quality of life. Study start of the CaboRISE trial was in October 2020. By February 2021, 7 centers across Germany have been initiated and a total of 4 out of 40 planned patients have been enrolled.

We conducted a multicenter prospective observational study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lenvatinib in clinical practice. Methods: This study conducted as a prospective study, and enrolled patients with uHCC initially receiving lenvatinib as systemic therapy who gave informed consent from July 2018 through January 2019. The observation period per patient was 12 months and e-CRF was used. Results: 713 patients were registered at 133 clinical sites. The safety analysis set and efficacy analysis set were 703 patients. Patient baseline characteristics included median age:73.0 years (25 to 94), male/ female: 564/139, bodyweight: < 60kg/≥60kg: 323/380, HBV/HCV/alcohol/NAFLD or NASH: 137/287/167/88, Child-Pugh classification A/B or higher: 624/75, BCLC stage A/B/C/D: 57/291/332/11, Vp 0/1/2/3/4: 520/31/52/60/22, with/without extrahepatic metastasis: 236/461. Previous treatment (local and systemic therapy) for hepatocellular carcinoma is with/without TACE: 513/190, median number of TACE treatment: 3.0 times (1 to 26), with/without HAIC: 74/629, with/without TKI pretreatment: 131/572. The initial dose was 8 mg (80.5%) and 12 mg (68.2%) in patients with < 60 kg and ≥60 kg, respectively. Median relative dose intensity was 64.2% and the treatment continuation rate at 3 and 12 months after administration of lenvatinib were 67.3% and 24.8%. Regarding safety, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) was 84.9% (grade 3 or higher: 42.5%). Common TRAEs (incidence rate ≥10%) were decreased appetite (23.9%), malaise (21.8%), hypertension (21.3%), proteinuria (18.3%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (16.5%), hypothyroidism (15.8%), and diarrhea (13.9%). TRAEs of grade 3 or higher (incidence rate ≥2.5%) were proteinuria (6.7%), hypertension (6.4%), malaise (3.8%), decreased appetite (3.6%), platelet count decreased (3.3%), palmarplantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (2.7%), diarrhea (2.7%) and hepatic encephalopathy (2.6%). The incidence of TRAEs leading to discontinuation of lenvatinib was 32.9%, and main TRAEs leading to discontinuation of lenvatinib were (incidence rate ≥2%) decreased appetite (6.3%), malaise (4.7%), proteinuria (3.3%) and hepatic encephalopathy (2.4%). Regarding efficacy, the ORR and DCR was 39.5% (95% CI: 35.1, 43.9) and 78.9% (75.1, 82.5) in 494 patients who were evaluated for the best response by mRECIST. The median OS was 498.0 days (95% CI: 439.0, -) in 703 patients.

Date of Publication: 2021","2021","39","15 SUPPL",,,"2021","Background: In Study 202, pts received LEN 12 mg/d for treatment of unresectable (u)HCC, irrespective of BW. Correlations between early dose adjustments and BW in Study 202 led to BW-adjusted dosing in the phase 3 REFLECT study of LEN in uHCC. In REFLECT, pts <60 kg received LEN 8 mg/d and pts ≥60 kg received LEN 12 mg/d. While improvements in safety were expected by reducing the LEN starting dose to 8 mg/d in pts <60 kg, any differences in safety and efficacy of BW-adjusted dosing vs standard dosing among pts with lower BW have yet to be determined. Herein, we compare safety and efficacy of LEN based on pts' BW (<60 kg vs ≥60 kg) in Study 202 (LEN 12 mg/d irrespective of BW) and in Japanese pts in REFLECT (dose adjusted by BW). Methods: This ad hoc analysis included all pts from Study 202 (n=46; all Asian, 43 Japanese) and Japanese pts from REFLECT (n=81). Safety and efficacy were assessed in Study 202 and REFLECT according to pt BW (<60 kg vs ≥60 kg). Tumors were assessed using mRECIST, by independent radiologic review. Results: In Study 202, pts in the <60 kg group had a median treatment duration of 5.8 mos and received 57% of the LEN planned starting dose (PSD); pts in the ≥60 kg group had a median treatment duration of 9.4 mos and received 78.6% of the LEN PSD. Among Japanese pts in REFLECT, median treatment duration was 5.7 mos in both treatment groups; pts in the LEN 8 mg group received 79.1% of the PSD and pts in the LEN 12 mg group received 70.7% of the PSD. In Study 202, treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) led to dose reduction in 80.8% of pts in the <60 kg group and 55% of pts in the ≥60 kg group. In REFLECT, TRAEs led to dose reductions in 52.5% of pts in the LEN 8 mg group and 70.7% of pts in the LEN 12 mg group. Serious TRAEs occurred at incidences of 46.2% and 10.0% in Study 202 in the <60 kg and ≥60 kg groups, and 15.0% and 22.0% in REFLECT in the LEN 8 mg and LEN 12 mg groups, respectively. Efficacy results are in the Table. Conclusions: Despite the small sample size, this comparison of Study 202 pts and Japanese pts from REFLECT indicates that BW-adjusted LEN dosing in pts with uHCC yielded comparable efficacy between pts <60 kg who received LEN 8 mg and pts ≥60 kg who received LEN 12 mg. The safety profile was favorable in pts <60 kg who received LEN 8 mg in REFLECT vs those who received LEN 12 mg in Study 202. Fewer serious TRAEs and dose reductions due to TRAEs were observed in pts with lower BW who received the LEN 8 mg starting dose in REFLECT. These data suggest that by reducing the starting dose from LEN 12 mg to 8 mg in pts with uHCC and lower BW (<60 kg), safety is improved without compromising efficacy.",,,,L635588839,10.1200/JCO.2021.39.15_suppl.e16119

KEYNOTE-224 (NCT02702414) evaluated pembrolizumab (pembro; anti-PD-1) in sorafenib (sora)-treated pts with aHCC and showed an ORR of 17% that was durable in responders receiving pembro, ultimately leading to FDA approval. In KEYNOTE224, a landmark analysis showed that OR in pembro-treated pts was prognostic of longer OS. The KEYNOTE-240 (NCT02702401) study evaluated pembro + best supportive care (BSC) vs placebo (pbo) + BSC in sora-treated pts with aHCC. Although clinical benefit was observed in KEYNOTE-240 with pembro vs pbo, prespecified statistical significance criteria for OS and PFS were not met. This post hoc analysis of KEYNOTE-240 was performed to determine whether OR at landmark is prognostic of longer survival after landmark time. Methods: Eligible pts were aged ≥18 y, had confirmed aHCC, and experienced progression during or after sora treatment or intolerance to sora. Landmark analyses of OS according to OR at 6, 12, and 18 wk after randomization were performed on the pembro arm to evaluate the association between survival after the landmark with response achieved before the landmark. OR was assessed by blinded independent central review per RECIST v1.1. Responders at each landmark were defined as pts with any response assessment of CR or PR before the landmark date; all other pts were defined as nonresponders. HR and 95% CI for survival after the landmark were calculated from the Cox proportional hazards model using Efron method of tie handling, with responder status as a single covariate. Analysis was performed on the ITT population. Results: As of Jan 2, 2019, median time from randomization to data cutoff was 21.2 mo (range 13.4-30.4) for pembro. In the pembro arm, 51 pts (18.3%) had a best OR of CR or PR and 6 pts (4.4%) in the pbo arm had a best OR of PR (no CR) (excluded from landmark analyses). OS after landmark time was longer for responders than nonresponders at the wk 6, 12, and 18 time points (Table). The HR for OS after landmark time for responders vs nonresponders was 0.37 (95% CI 0.18-0.75), 0.39 (95% CI 0.23-0.66), and 0.37 (95% CI 0.21- 0.63) at wk 6, 12, and 18, respectively.

However, its use in the post-immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) setting has yet to be described. We evaluated the pattern of use, efficacy, survival and tolerability of cabozantinib in aHCC patients with previous treatment by ICIs. Methods: We did a multi-centre, territory-wide study analysing aHCC patients who received cabozantinib after prior ICIs. Objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), time-toprogression (TTP), overall survival (OS) and treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) were assessed. Results: Thirty-one patients were included. The median age was 58.0 (range 41- 85) and 77.4% had Child-Pugh A cirrhosis. 51.6% of patients received single agent cabozantinib and 48.4% received cabozantinib in combination with ICIs. ≥80% of patients received cabozantinib beyond the second-line and 93.5% of patients had prior TKIs. All patients received prior anti-PD-1 and 61.3% had prior anti-CTLA-4. The median follow-up was 15.2 months. For single agent cabozantinib patients, the ORR was 6.3%, DCR was 31.3% and median TTP was 3.5 months (95% C.I. 1.2-5.8). For cabozantinib-ICI combination patients, the ORR was 6.7%, DCR was 26.7% and median TTP was 2.3 months (95% C.I. 1.4-3.1). The overall median OS was 8.9 months (95% C.I. 5.7-11.9). Single agent cabozantinib patients had a significantly shorter OS compared to cabozantinib-ICI combination patients (8.3 months (95% C.I. 1.3-15.2) vs. 15.1 months (95% C.I. 11.1-19.2), p = 0.047).

Of this, 20-30% will develop nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a progressive form of NAFLD characterized by steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning. Patients with NASH are at risk of developing cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Within this review we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and phase 3 clinical trials targeting NASH. The pathogenesis of NASH is multifactorial and complex with inter-patient heterogeneity. Central to its development is abnormal intra-hepatic steatosis and toxic metabolite production, followed by oxidative stress, hepatic inflammation, and cell death. Insulin resistance, adipocyte dysfunction, and inflammasome activation contribute to disease progression and fibrogenesis. Numerous therapeutic targets have been investigated for NASH, however there are currently no approved pharmacologic treatment options. This rapid review revealed that few large-scale phase 3 clinical trials have demonstrated long-term efficacy in NASH. Current clinical trials of obeticholic acid, resmetirom, aramchol, and cenicriviroc look promising and may be effective treatment options for NASH in the future.

Here, we evaluate outcomes based on albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade in the RESORCE trial. Methods: Overall, 573 patients were randomized 2:1 to REG 160 mg or PBO. Eligible adults had HCC, ≥ 1 measurable lesion, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B/C disease, tolerated previous sorafenib and received their last dose within 10 weeks of randomization, and Child-Pugh A liver function. ALBI grade was determined by baseline ALBI score (serum albumin and total bilirubin). Subgroup analyses of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), treatment duration, overall survival (OS), and safety were conducted, stratified by ALBI grade. Results: At baseline, 164 patients (43%) were ALBI grade 1 and 213 patients (56%) were ALBI grade 2 in the REG arm; 81 patients (42%) were ALBI grade 1 and 112 patients (58%) were ALBI grade 2 in the PBO arm. One patient in each arm was ALBI grade 3. In the REG arm, patients who were ALBI grade 1 vs 2 had better ECOG PS, longer treatment duration and OS, and fewer discontinuations due to a treatment-related adverse event (AE; Table). Median OS was longer in the REG arm vs PBO, regardless of ALBI grade. In the REG arm, incidences of grade 3/4 treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) by ALBI grade were similar (ALBI grade 1/2 = 66%/67%); patients who were ALBI grade 1 vs 2 had more grade 3/4 hypertension (20% vs 11%) and grade 3 hand-foot skin reaction (17% vs 9%).

Date of Publication: 2021","2021","49","SUPPL 2","6","7","2021","Bacground: Hepatocellular carcinoma is fourth leading cause of death among cancer patients. This cancer is four to eight times more common in the male population and is usually associated with chronic liver damage (hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and alcoholic cirrhosis). Cirrhosis, regardless of the cause, is present in 70-80% of HCC cases. Chronic infection with HBV and cirrhosis increases the possibility of HCC up to 100 times. 5-30% of patients with HCV infection develop chronic liver disease, > 30% progress to cirrhosis, and in that population, 1-2% of them develop HCC annually. Co-infection with HBV further increases the risk of developing the disease. Other risk factors are: alcohol abuse, autoimmune diseases (autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis), metabolic diseases (diabetes mellitus, hemochromatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.) and environmental toxins (alpha-toxins, alcohol, tobacco). According to currently available epidemiological data, HCC still kills about 1,000,000 people a year, and the 5-year OS is less than 5%. Current treatment of HCC: Historically, in the last few decades, systemic HCC therapy has relied on classical chemotherapy, which unfortunately has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. We see the first big leap in treatment in 2007 with the introduction of Sorafenib into clinical practice. Sorafenib, a TKI inhibitor, demonstrated in the SHARP study has been shown to have better OS and PFS for 3 months compared to the placebo group. Until 2017, Sorafenib was the only treatment option for HCC - numerous clinical studies with EGFR and VGFR, TKI inhibitors gave negative results (BRIK FL, LIGHT and SEARCH studies).Since 2017, the revolution in the treatment of this disease has continued, with the fact that in a short period of time we suddenly have more than 10 drugs that have FDA and EMA approval for the treatment of HCC in the first and second line. The first drug to show non-inferiority to Sorafenib in the REFLECT study was Lenvatinib, thus finding its place as another option in first-line HCC treatment. At the same time, several targeted drugs show their efficacy in the second line of HCC treatment - Regorafenib (RESORCE study), Cabozantinib (CELESTIAL Study) and Remocirumab. The concept of monoimmunotherapy, after promising results from phase 2 studies - Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab, has unfortunately not been confirmed in phase 3 studies, and the concept of monoimmunotherapy is not recommended. Given the studies presented at ASCO GI (IMBRAVE150), the future of HCC treatment is most likely to be found in combinations of immunotherapy + target therapy, as well as combinations of CTLA4 inhibitors and immunotherapy. IMBRAVE150 is a study that established the combination of atezolizumab + bevacizumab as first-line therapy. The study alone included 150 patients, randomized 2: 1, and the primary goal of the study was OS and PFS. The median PFS for the combination was 6.8 months, compared with 4.3 months in the Sorafenib group. The side effects shown in the atezolizumab and bevacizumab groups corresponded to the safety profiles of drugs known from before, and 15% of patients discontinued therapy due to side effects. In contrast, 10% of patients discontinued Sorafenib therapy due to side effects. Combination therapy also resulted in a longer time to deterioration in quality of life than in patients on Sorafenib. A couple of phase two studies examining the efficacy of combinations of VEGFR inhibitors + Pembrolizumab, and a combination of CTLA4 inhibitors and immunotherapy showed promising results. The results of a phase III study of LEAP-002 - efficacy and safety of the combination of Lenvatinib and Pembrolizumab, in first-line therapy of advanced / metastatic HCC, are currently expected. The primary objectives of the study are OS and PFS. Interesting results are also expected in the HIMALAYA phase 3 study, where the efficacy and safety of durvalumab + tremelimumab and durvalumab monotherapy are evaluated compared to sorafenib in the treatment of naive patients with unserctable HCC. The study was randomized into four groups, but it will be interesting to follow the results between the two combination groups Durvalumab + Tremelimubab, given the choice of drug dose. The COSMIC-312 study compares the efficacy of Cabozatinib + atezolizumab versus Sorafenib in first-line therapy. The CheckMATE-040 study investigated the efficacy and safety of Nivolumab, alone or in combination with immunotherapy, in patients with concomitant comorbidities. Conclusion: After a long time, in the treatment of HCC in addition to chemotherapy, we have made progress in the form of targeted therapy and immunotherapy, as well as combinations of the same that are currently being investigated. In the end, the question remains how to further sequence HCC therapy? This is a question to which there is no clear answer right now, given that we have not recently had an option for a second line of therapy and now we already have over 10 approved drugs. Proper sequencing of therapy lines would greatly facilitate the treatment of patients with HCC, taking into account that patients with HCC are usually in a severe general condition, burdened with primary disease and concomitant comorbidities. Numerous clinical studies that are underway will most likely better clarify these dilemmas and thus enable better sequencing of the therapy itself.",,,,L637428405,

Date of Publication: 2021","2021","49","SUPPL 2","33","34","2021","Despite the many challenges faced in 2020, we have seen impressive progress in many areas of cancer research. Twenty-one novel oncology drugs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although cancer is one of the major public health problems worldwide, cancer mortality projections for 2021 confirm the persistent declines in cancer mortality in EU and US for many specific cancers. The breast cancer treatment landscape has evolved in the past year and several new drugs approved in 2020 as antibody drugs conjugates (ADC) sacituzumab in TNBC and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd) in metastatic HER2 positive BC, as well as tucatinib, a small kinase inhibitor. A few very important clinical trial /RxPONDER, ADAPT, PRIME II/ presented last year support de-escalation of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, sparing patients from some of the side effects that can accompany treatments. In ovarian cancer five-year follow-up data from the SOLO-1 trial continue to show progression-free survival benefit of olaparib as maintenance therapy following platinum-based chemotherapy in the frontline setting. In the final analysis of SOLO-2 trial, maintenance olaparib provided an improvement of 12.9 months in median OS vs placebo in women with relapsed BRCA-related ovarian cancer who had responded to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy after having received at least one more line of chemotherapy.In 2020 first new treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma approved in more than ten years according to the data from phase III IMbrave 150 trial. In that study, which includes 501 patients the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab provides the longest survival seen in a front-line phase III study in advanced HCC, confirming atezo + bev as a standard of care for previously untreated, unresectable HCC.In the field of thoracic oncology there were some very important news in 2020, potentially practice changing. Osimertinib, next generation EGFR-TKI, standard first line therapy in metastatic EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC was successfully used, in ADAURA study, in adjuvant setting vs placebo (planned treatment duration three years), in resected NSCLC patients, stage IB-IIIA. Patients might had adjuvant chemotherapy also, and there was no outcome differences between these two groups. Overall, there was a 79% reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death (DFS HR was 0.21, p<0.0001). Lorlatinib is the third generation of ALKinhibitors in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. The results of CROWN study where lorlatinib was given in the first line treatment were presented at ESMO 2020. In this randomized study, comparing lorlatinib with crizotinib, lorlatinib was superior in the term of PFS, HR was 0.28, p<0.001, this superiority was particularly pronounced in intracranial disease, where the percent of intracranial response was 82% in lorlatinib arm and only 23% in crizotinib arm, and percent of complete response per CT was 71% vs 7%. Lorlatinib has been recently approved for patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespectively of treatment line. Also of interest were two studies that inovatively used immunologic drugs as a combination in advanced NSCLC: in Check Mate 9LA randomized study, cytotoxic chemotherapy was given in paralell with nivolumab + ipilimumab for first two cycles, and compared with four cycles of chemoherapy. Median OS was significantly better: 15.6 vs 10.9 months, HR 0.66 and a overall response rate was 38% vs 25%. CITYSCAPE study give us inovative combination of two immuno-oncology drugs, tiragolumab as TIGIT inhibitor, and standard atezolizumab. Median PFS was particularly longer in the population of patients with high PD-L1 expression (NE vs 4.11 months, HR 0.30). In gastrointestinal oncology, last year will be remembered by introducing immunotherapy in first line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer for patients with MSI-H tumors. In KN177, such patients were randomized to receive pembrolizumab or standard chemotherapy+/-biologic therapy, and after second interim analysis, there was a very clear adventage for pembrolizumab in terms of mPFS (16.5 vs 8.2 months) and duraton of response (at 24 months, 83% vs 35%). The results are impressive, and it is for expected to be confirmed by OS adventage in future analyses. In urological oncology, JAVELIN Bladder 100 study demonstrated that the maintenance avelumab + best supportive care is superior over best supportive care alone after platinum-based first-line chemotherapy in advanced urothelial carcinoma. In overall population, OS was 21.4 vs 14.3 months, HR 0.69, p<0.001, and the results are even better in PD-L1 positive population, with HR 0.56. These results are very probably practice changing, since cytotoxic chemotherapy have very modest achievements in the field of urothelial cancer.",,,,L637428440,

RESULTS Nine phase III randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. RECOMMENDATIONS Atezolizumab 1 bevacizumab (atezo 1 bev) may be offered as first-line treatment of most patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh class A liver disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0-1, and following management of esophageal varices, when present, according to institutional guidelines. Where there are contraindications to atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab, tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib or lenvatinib may be offered as first-line treatment of patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh class A liver disease, and ECOG PS 0-1. Following first-line treatment with atezo 1 bev, and until better data are available, second-line therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor may be recommended for appropriate candidates. Following first-line therapy with sorafenib or lenvatinib, second-line therapy options for appropriate candidates include cabozantinib, regorafenib for patients who previously tolerated sorafenib, or ramucirumab (for patients with a-fetoprotein $ 400 ng/mL), or atezo 1 bev where patients did not have access to this option as first-line therapy. Pembrolizumab or nivolumab are also reasonable options for appropriate patients following sorafenib or lenvatinib. Consideration of nivolumab 1 ipilimumab as an option for second-line therapy and third-line therapy is discussed. Further guidance on choosing between therapy options is included within the guideline.

In recent years, the attention has been focused on the personalization of cancer vaccines. However, the efficacy of therapeutic cancer vaccines is still disappointing despite the large number of vaccine strategies targeting different tumors that have been evaluated in recent years. While the preclinical data have frequently shown encouraging results, clinical trials have not provided satisfactory data to date. The main reason for such failures is the complexity of identifying specific target tumor antigens that should be unique or overexpressed only by the tumor cells compared to normal cells. Most of the tumor antigens included in cancer vaccines are non-mutated overexpressed self-antigens, eliciting mainly T cells with low-affinity T cell receptors (TCR) unable to mediate an effective anti-tumor response.

The limited anticancer activity observed in this unselected patient population does not support further exploration of trametinib plus sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Background: The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is associated with proliferation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Preclinical data suggest that paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway may be one of the resistance mechanisms of sorafenib; therefore, we evaluated trametinib plus sorafenib in HCC. Methods: This was a phase I study with a 3+3 design in patients with treatment-naïve advanced HCC. The primary objective was safety and tolerability. The secondary objective was clinical efficacy. Results: A total of 17 patients were treated with three different doses of trametinib and sorafenib. Two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity, including grade 4 hypertension and grade 3 elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/bilirubin over 7 days. Maximum tolerated dose was trametinib 1.5 mg daily and sorafenib 200 mg twice a day. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were elevated AST (37%) and hypertension (24%). Among 11 evaluable patients, 7 (63.6%) had stable disease with no objective response. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.7 and 7.8 months, respectively.

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2020","2020","56",,"83","93","1 Dec 2020","There are more than 500 kinases in the human genome, many of which are oncogenic once constitutively activated. Fortunately, numerous hyperactive kinases are druggable, and several targeted small molecule kinase inhibitors have demonstrated impressive clinical benefits in cancer treatment. However, their often cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effect on cancer cells, and the development of resistance mechanisms, remain significant limitations to these targeted therapies. Oncolytic viruses are an emerging class of immunotherapeutic agents with a specific oncotropic nature and excellent safety profile, highlighting them as a promising alternative to conventional therapeutic modalities. Nonetheless, the clinical efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy is challenged by immunological and physical barriers that limit viral delivery, replication, and spread within tumours. Several of these barriers are often associated with oncogenic kinase activity and, in some cases, worsened by the action of oncolytic viruses on kinase signaling during infection. What if inhibiting these kinases could potentiate the cancer-lytic and anti-tumour immune stimulating properties of oncolytic virotherapies? This could represent a paradigm shift in the use of specific kinase inhibitors in the clinic and provide a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of cancers. A phase III clinical trial combining the oncolytic Vaccinia virus Pexa-Vec with the kinase inhibitor Sorafenib was initiated. While this trial failed to show any benefits over Sorafenib monotherapy in patients with advanced liver cancer, several pre-clinical studies demonstrate that targeting kinases combined with oncolytic viruses have synergistic effects highlighting this strategy as a unique avenue to cancer therapy. Herein, we review the combinations of oncolytic viruses with kinase inhibitors reported in the literature and discuss the clinical opportunities that represent these pharmacoviral approaches.",,,32690442,L2007103322,10.1016/j.cytogfr.2020.07.008

Sintilimab (Tyvyt®), a highly selective fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody, blocks the binding site of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), thereby, inhibiting the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands (PD-L1/2) to restore the endogenous anti-tumor T cell responses. Sintilimab has been proven to be clinically beneficial in multiple solid tumor therapies. Combination therapy and monotherapy have shown potential and encouraging anti-tumor efficacy with controllable and acceptable toxicities. The combination therapy is more likely to be a novel and promising therapeutic option. This study provides an overview of the status of sintilimab-based clinical trials in various solid tumors.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02937116, NCT03114683, NCT03607539, NCT0362852, NCT03628521, NCT03629925, NCT03700476, NCT03745170, NCT03765775, NCT03794440, NCT03812549, NCT03869034, NCT03884192, NCT03946969, NCT0398504, NCT03989336, NCT03994744, NCT04026841, NCT04052152, NCT04052659, NCT04065282, NCT04072679, NCT04096911, NCT04104074, NCT04127227, NCT04144582, NCT04167293, NCT0417478, NCT0417908, NCT04192682, NCT04213170, NCT04220944, NCT04258111, NCT04271813, NCT04297280, NCT04300959, NCT04356872, NCT04398927, NCT0440085, NCT0440181, NCT04411706, NCT04513301)",,,L2007476359,10.1186/s40364-020-00250-z

In our retrospective analysis, we studied the immunobiology and potential associations between biomarkers and outcomes with nivolumab in HCC. Methods: Fresh and archival tumour samples from dose-escalation and dose-expansion phases of the CheckMate 040 trial were analysed by immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing to assess several inflammatory gene expression signatures, including CD274 (PD-ligand 1 [PD-L1]), CD8A, LAG3, and STAT1. Biomarkers were assessed for association with clinical outcomes (best overall response by blinded independent central review per RECIST v1.1 and overall survival [OS]). Results: Complete or partial tumour responses were observed in PD-L1–positive and PD-L1–negative patients treated with nivolumab monotherapy. Median OS was 28.1 (95% CI 18.2–n.a.) vs. 16.6 months (95% CI 14.2–20.2) for patients with tumour PD-L1 ≥1% vs. <1% (p = 0.03). Increased CD3 and CD8 showed a non-significant trend towards improved OS (both p = 0.08), and macrophage markers were not associated with OS. Tumour PD-1 and PD-L1 expression were associated with improved OS (p = 0.05 and p = 0.03, respectively). An inflammatory gene signature consisting of 4 genes was associated with improved objective response rate (p = 0.05) and OS (p = 0.01). Conclusions: PD-1 and PD-L1 expression, biomarkers of inflammation, and inflammatory gene signatures trended with improved survival and response. While further confirmation within a larger phase III trial is needed to evaluate predictive value of these biomarkers, these exploratory analyses suggest that anti-tumour immune response may play a role in the treatment benefit of nivolumab in HCC. Lay summary: Certain tests may be used to provide a picture of how a tumour is escaping the immune system, allowing it to continue to grow and create more tumours. Therapies such as nivolumab are designed to help the immune system fight the tumour. These tests may be used to determine how effective such therapies will be in the treatment of advanced liver cancer.

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2020","2020","4","4","191","198","1 Dec 2020","The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been increasing for decades. This disease has now risen to become the sixth most common malignancy overall, while ranking as the third most frequent cause of cancer mortality. While several surgical interventions and loco-regional treatment options are available, up to 80% of patients present with advanced disease not amenable to standard therapies. Indeed, traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are notoriously ineffective and essentially play no role in the management of affected patients. This has led to an enormous need for more effective systemic therapeutic options. In recent years, immunotherapy has emerged as a potentially viable and exciting new alternative for the treatment of HCC. Although the current immunotherapeutic options remain imperfect, various strategies can be employed to further improve their efficacy. New findings have revealed epigenetic modulation can be effective as a new approach for improving HCC immunotherapy. Studying the gut microbiome (gut-liver axis) can also be an interesting subject in this regard. Here, we explore the latest insights into the role of immunotherapy treating HCC, both mono and in combination with other agents. We also focus on the impact of epigenetic drugs and the microbiome in the overall effectiveness of HCC immunotherapy.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02576509)",,,L2008511518,10.1016/j.livres.2020.10.001

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2020","2020","31",,"S1429",,"1 Dec 2020","Background: In a phase II uHCC study (NCT02519348) the novel regimen T300+D (single, priming dose of T 300 mg + D 1500 mg, then D Q4W) had the best benefit-risk profile vs T or D alone or T75+D (T 75 mg Q4W + D 1500 mg Q4W [4 doses], then D Q4W). Recent data with checkpoint therapies suggest anti-drug antibodies (ADA) can reduce drug efficacy, thus we evaluated immunogenicity and safety in uHCC pts. Methods: Checkpoint therapy-naïve pts with uHCC who progressed on, were intolerant to, or refused sorafenib were randomized to T300+D, D (1500 mg Q4W), T (750 mg Q4W) or T75+D. Safety and tolerability was the primary endpoint. ADA presence was assessed by electrochemiluminescent bridging assay. Results: At data cutoff (02/28/2020), 332 pts were enrolled. Treatment-related adverse event (trAE) and ADA incidences are shown in the table. Only 1 pt was ADA+ for D (T75+D arm); ≤ 5 pts in each cohort had treatment-emergent (TE)-ADA to T. Only 1 TE-ADA+ pt had a persistent ADA response ≥16 wks to T. Median max titers to T were 8 (T300+D; T) or 128 (T75+D). The rarity of ADA+ pts barred analysis of associations between positivity and AE type/frequency or efficacy. [Formula presented] Conclusions: In this study D and T immunogenicity was minimal. ADAs to D or T were few, of short duration (ie, <16 wks) and low titers, suggesting a similarly minimal impact on safety or efficacy.

Costs and outcomes were discounted at 2,5%. Parametric functions of both treatment were fitted to the phase III IMBrave 150 trial data regarding progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Health state utilities were estimated from the IMbrave150 trial using EQ-5D-5L with French tariff to apply French preference scores. Costs were calculated from a collective perspective. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were run to explore parameter uncertainty. Results: Compared to sorafenib, the therapeutic combination atezolizumab + bevacizumab was associated with a gain of 0.79 QALY (2.49 vs 1.71) and an incremental cost of €95 026 resulting in an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of €120 935€/QALY.

Head-to-head comparisons between most of the available agents have not been performed and are less likely to be examined in a prospective fashion in the future. Therefore, a network meta-analysis (NMA) is helpful to compare different agents from across different trials. Objective: To evaluate comparative effectiveness of different systemic treatments in advanced patients with HCC across lines of therapy. Data Sources: We searched various databases for abstracts and full-text articles published from database inception through March 2020. Study Selection: We included phase 3 trials evaluating different vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (VEGFis), checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs), or their combinations in advanced HCC, in the first-line or refractory setting. Data Extraction and Synthesis: The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. The overall effect was pooled using the random effects model. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes of interest included overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Findings: Fourteen trials (8 in the first-line setting and 6 in the second-line setting) at low risk of bias were included. The 8 trials in the first-line setting encompassed a total of 6290 patients, with an age range of 18 to 89 years. The 5 trials included in the second-line analysis encompassed a total of 2653 patients, with an age range of 18 to 91 years. Network meta-analysis showed the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab was superior in patients with HCC treated in the first-line setting compared with lenvatinib (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.44-0.89), sorafenib (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42-0.80), and nivolumab (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48-0.98). In the refractory setting, NMA showed that all studied drugs had PFS benefit compared with placebo. However, this only translated into OS benefit with regorafenib (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.51-0.75) and cabozantinib (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63-0.92) compared with placebo. In the NMA of patients with α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels of 400 ng/mL or greater, regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab showed PFS and OS benefit compared with placebo with no superiority of an active drug compared with any others. Conclusions and Relevance: This systematic review and NMA of 14 trials found that atezolizumab and bevacizumab in combination is now considered the standard of care in the first-line setting in patients with advanced HCC. Regorafenib and cabozantinib are preferred options in refractory patients, with ramucirumab as an additional option in those with levels of AFP of 400 ng/mL or higher. Future trials should focus on other potential combinations and best treatment strategy in patients with prior VEGFi/CPI exposure.",,,33090186,L633327917,10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.4930

Sorafenib increased the available treatment options for patients with extrahepatic spread and vascular invasion and improved survival in patients with advanced HCC; however, various shortcomings such as low response rates and relatively high toxicity (e.g., hand-foot skin reaction) prompted concerted efforts aimed at developing new molecular targeted agents to provide more treatment options and second-line agents for patients with disease progression or intolerance to sorafenib. Despite many attempts to develop new drugs between 2007 and 2016, all first-line and second-line clinical trials conducted during this period failed. However, between 2017 and 2019, 4 drugs (lenvatinib as a first-line agent and regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab as second-line agents) emerged in quick succession from clinical trials and became available for clinical use.

In chronic infections, the interplay between human and viral genetics contributes to HBV evolutionary changes. Here, we use a genome-to-genome (G2G) approach to identify sites of host-pathogen genomic interactions. Materials and Methods: We obtained paired human exome and HBV genome data from 424 chronically infected individuals of Asian ancestry from three Phase 3 studies evaluating tenofovir-based regimens. For each variable HBV amino acid, a genome-wide association study was conducted using generalized linear mixed models and controlling for human and viral population structures. Results: We identified strong associations (p=1.9E-12) between an Asian-specific missense SNP in the SLC10A1 gene encoding the HBV receptor NTCP (rs2296651) and amino acids in HBV large surface (preS1 domain) and polymerase proteins. The minor allele is present in 7% of East Asians (1KG Project) and was previously reported to associate with decreased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic HBV. We also identified significant associations (p=8.7E-13) between variants of HLA-A protein and amino acids in HBV polymerase and core proteins. Conclusions: Our joint analysis of human and viral genomes shows that variation in NTCP exerts selective pressure on HBV during chronic infection, and confirms the impact of HLA class I variation on HBV epitopes. These results demonstrate the power of the G2G approach to identify host restriction factors and identify specific HBV amino acids likely to be involved in the interaction between HBV and its cellular receptor.",,,,L634066693,10.1038/s41431-020-00739-z

It is now well established that p-glycoprotein acts as an ATP dependent pump that pumps out small molecules from cells. Ample evidence exist that show p-glycoprotein expression levels correlate with drug efficacy, which suggests the rationale for developing p-glycoprotein inhibitors for treatment against cancer. Preclinical and clinical studies have investigated this possibility, but mostly were limited by substantial toxicities. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs that have p-glycoprotein inhibition activities is therefore a potential alternative approach. In this review, we searched the Drugbank Database (https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs) and identified 98 FDA-approved small molecules that possess p-glycoprotein inhibition properties. Focusing on the small molecules approved with indications against non-cancer diseases, we query the scientific literature for studies that specifically investigate these therapeutics as cancer treatment. In light of this analysis, potential development opportunities will then be thoroughly investigated for future efforts in repositioning of non-cancer p-glycoprotein inhibitors in single use or in combination therapy for clinical oncology treatment.","ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov00002487, ClinicalTrials.gov00002489, ClinicalTrials.gov00003625, ClinicalTrials.gov00003688, ClinicalTrials.gov00003950, ClinicalTrials.gov00005590, ClinicalTrials.gov00005941, ClinicalTrials.gov00068445, ClinicalTrials.gov00165295, ClinicalTrials.gov00185640, ClinicalTrials.gov00420615, ClinicalTrials.gov00428909, ClinicalTrials.gov00461084, ClinicalTrials.gov00473980, ClinicalTrials.gov00474903, ClinicalTrials.gov00706810, ClinicalTrials.gov00750737, ClinicalTrials.gov00752115, ClinicalTrials.gov00849329, ClinicalTrials.gov00936117, ClinicalTrials.gov00983424, ClinicalTrials.gov01163903, ClinicalTrials.gov01430351, ClinicalTrials.gov01480050, ClinicalTrials.gov01539655, ClinicalTrials.gov01539733, ClinicalTrials.gov01575782, ClinicalTrials.gov01748500, ClinicalTrials.gov01901172, ClinicalTrials.gov01950923, ClinicalTrials.gov01951950, ClinicalTrials.gov01980823, ClinicalTrials.gov01992016, ClinicalTrials.gov02071537, ClinicalTrials.gov02074839, ClinicalTrials.gov02117648, ClinicalTrials.gov02129829, ClinicalTrials.gov02236806, ClinicalTrials.gov02248428, ClinicalTrials.gov02273739, ClinicalTrials.gov02279992, ClinicalTrials.gov02311569, ClinicalTrials.gov02333890, ClinicalTrials.gov02466802, ClinicalTrials.gov02518373, ClinicalTrials.gov02771405, ClinicalTrials.gov02834403, ClinicalTrials.gov02836925, ClinicalTrials.gov02852083, ClinicalTrials.gov02935205, ClinicalTrials.gov02940496, ClinicalTrials.gov02950259, ClinicalTrials.gov03021486, ClinicalTrials.gov03145012, ClinicalTrials.gov03563248, ClinicalTrials.gov03743649, ClinicalTrials.gov04056910, ClinicalTrials.gov04092179, ClinicalTrials.gov04188119, ClinicalTrials.gov04189588, ClinicalTrials.gov04237090, ClinicalTrials.gov04278781, ClinicalTrials.gov04281498, ClinicalTrials.gov04337580)",,,L633524623,10.3389/fonc.2020.561936

"Augmenting Anticancer Immunity Through Combined Targeting of Angiogenic and PD-1/PD-L1 Pathways: Challenges and Opportunities","Hack S.P., Zhu A.X., Wang Y.","Frontiers in Immunology (2020) 11 Article Number: 598877. Date of Publication: 5 Nov 2020","2020","11",,,,"5 Nov 2020","Cancer immunotherapy (CIT) with antibodies targeting the programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1)/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis have changed the standard of care in multiple cancers. However, durable antitumor responses have been observed in only a minority of patients, indicating the presence of other inhibitory mechanisms that act to restrain anticancer immunity. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies targeted against other immune suppressive mechanisms are needed to enhance anticancer immunity and maximize the clinical benefit of CIT in patients who are resistant to immune checkpoint inhibition. Preclinical and clinical studies have identified abnormalities in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that can negatively impact the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drive immunosuppression in the TME by inducing vascular abnormalities, suppressing antigen presentation and immune effector cells, or augmenting the immune suppressive activity of regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and tumor-associated macrophages. In turn, immunosuppressive cells can drive angiogenesis, thereby creating a vicious cycle of suppressed antitumor immunity. VEGF-mediated immune suppression in the TME and its negative impact on the efficacy of CIT provide a therapeutic rationale to combine PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies with anti-VEGF drugs in order to normalize the TME. A multitude of clinical trials have been initiated to evaluate combinations of a PD-1/PD-L1 antibody with an anti-VEGF in a variety of cancers. Recently, the positive results from five Phase III studies in non-small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma), renal cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma have shown that combinations of PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and anti-VEGF agents significantly improved clinical outcomes compared with respective standards of care. Such combinations have been approved by health authorities and are now standard treatment options for renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. A plethora of other randomized studies of similar combinations are currently ongoing. Here, we discuss the principle mechanisms of VEGF-mediated immunosuppression studied in preclinical models or as part of translational clinical studies. We also discuss data from recently reported randomized clinical trials. Finally, we discuss how these concepts and approaches can be further incorporated into clinical practice to improve immunotherapy outcomes for patients with cancer.",,,33250900,L633424899,10.3389/fimmu.2020.598877

Single or dual targeting does not appear to alter the natural history of the cancer, and novel therapeutics are needed. Estrogen deprivation therapy with letrozole and leuprolide, alone or in combination with the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, did not demonstrate clinical activity in advanced fibrolamellar carcinoma. The study drugs were well tolerated when administered as single agents or in combination in this patient population. This study demonstrates that, despite the rarity of FLC, multicenter therapeutic clinical trials are feasible and support the value of this consortium. Background: Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is an uncommon malignancy in young people and is sometimes associated with pregnancy and oral contraceptive use. Immunohistochemical staining and genetic profiling of FLC tumor specimens have revealed aromatase overexpression. The overexpression of mTOR and S6 kinase has been noted in 25% of FLC. On the basis of interaction between estrogen and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, we hypothesized that suppression of estrogen and mTOR signaling could have antineoplastic activity in FLC. Methods: Patients were randomized to arm A (everolimus), arm B (letrozole/leuprolide; estrogen deprivation therapy [EDT]), or arm C (everolimus/letrozole/leuprolide). Upon disease progression, patients in arm A or B could proceed to part 2 (everolimus/letrozole/leuprolide). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months (PFS6) assessed using a Simon's minimax two-stage design, hypothesizing an improvement in PFS6 from 40% to 64% with the study regimen. Results: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled. An unplanned analysis was performed because of perceived concern for lack of efficacy. Stable disease was observed in 9 of 26 evaluable patients (35%). PFS6 was 0%. Median overall survival (OS) was 12.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.4–20.9) for the whole study cohort. Grade 3 adverse events in ≥10% of patients were nausea (11%), vomiting (11%), anemia (11%), elevated aspartate transaminase (AST; 32%), alanine transaminase (ALT; 36%), and alkaline phosphatase (14%). All 28 patients experienced an event for PFS outcome, and four deaths were due to disease progression. Conclusion: Neither EDT nor mTOR inhibition improved outcomes in FLC.

A retrospective meta-analysis of multiple phase III trials","Bohnsack O., Lesch M., Narang J., Bajpai S., Lencioni R.","Annals of Oncology (2020) 31 Supplement 6 (S1304). Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2020","2020","31",,"S1304",,"1 Nov 2020","Background: In 2010 mRECIST was published in Seminars of Liver Disease for the evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) response assessment. It proposed a modification of existing RECIST 1.1 incorporating visible changes and reduction in the arterial enhancement of the HCC tissue and the concept of measuring viable versus not measuring necrotic tissue, better evaluating treatment responses in HCC with CT or MRI. Methods: Multiple phase III clinical trials were analyzed using both mRECIST and RECIST 1.1 in parallel, which were read separately by blinded independent central read (BICR). The purpose was to compare the overall response rates and complete response rates by the two criteria. 2601 subjects with 13675 post-baseline imaging timepoints were included in this comparison. The Overall Response Rate (ORR) and the Complete Response Rate (CRR) are derived. Results: [Formula presented]. Conclusions: Our results indicate that: 1.) mRECIST has better ORR and CRR compared to RECIST 1.1. 2.) RECIST 1.1 has more timepoints with Stable Disease SD/NN compared to mRECIST. 3.) mRECIST has more Not Evaluable (NE) timepoints due to more stringent imaging specifications. mRECIST shows almost double the CRR than RECIST 1.1, and the ORR is 33% higher using mRECIST than RECIST 1.1. Stable Disease was observed about 20% more in the RECIST 1.1 analysis, which includes the Non-CR/Non-PD assessment of patients with only non measurable disease for non-target lesions. A reasonable explanation for such a 20% SD discordance being higher with RECIST 1.1 is primarily reflected in the higher number of documented responders assessed with mRECIST. A Non Evaluable (NE) response is more common with mRECIST. Our analysis confirms that mRECIST is more robust in assessing responding patients with CRR and ORR in HCC as it based on measuring the viable tumor component instead of plain linear RECIST 1.1 measurements of its total tumor diameter only.

The phase II part has demonstrated an acceptable safety of this combination. Here we report the result of phase III part (NCT03794440). Methods: Patients (pts) with unresectable or metastatic, systemic treatment naive HCC were enrolled and randomized (2:1) to receive sintilimab (200 mg IV Q3W) plus bevacizumab biosimilar (15 mg/kg IV Q3W) (SinBev arm) or sorafenib (400 mg orally, BID) (Sor arm). Stratification factors were macrovascular invasion and/or extrahepatic metastasis (presence vs absence), baseline alpha fetoprotein level (< 400 vs ≥400 ng/mL) and ECOG PS (0 vs 1). The primary endpoints were OS and PFS by independent radiographic review committee (IRRC) per RECIST 1.1. Results: As data cutoff date (Aug 15, 2020), 571 pts were enrolled to SinBev arm (n=380) and Sor arm (n=191). The baseline characteristics were well balanced between two arms, with most pts had hepatitis B infection (94.2%) and 4.2% of pts with Child-Pugh B. With a median follow-up of 10.0 m, median OS was significantly longer in SinBev arm than that in Sor arm (NE vs. 10.4 m, HR 0.57, 95%CI: 0.43-0.75, P<0.0001). Median PFS was significantly improved in SinBev arm as compared with Sor arm (4.5 m vs. 2.8 m, HR 0.57, 95%CI: 0.46-0.70, P<0.0001). The superior OS and PFS benefits with SinVev over Sor were generally consistent across all relevant subgroups. Among pts with evaluable tumor assessment at baseline, the confirmed ORR by IRRC per RECIST 1.1 was 20.3% (74/364, 95%CI: 16.3%-24.8%) in SinBev arm and 4.1% (7/172, 95%CI: 1.7%-8.2%) in Sor arm. Of pts receiving at least one drug dose, the incidences of treatment related adverse events were 88.7% in SinBev arm (n=380) and 93.5% in Sor arm (n=185). Grade 3-4 TRAEs occurred in 33.7% and 35.7% of pts, respectively.

The international, prospective REFINE study was designed to evaluate regorafenib in pts with uHCC in routine practice. We present interim results for pts enrolled in REFINE in Korea, China, and Taiwan. Methods: REFINE is an ongoing observational study that recruited patients with uHCC for whom a decision to treat with regorafenib was made by the treating physician prior to enrollment according to the local health authority approved label. A planned interim analysis was performed when the first 500 pts in the global cohort had been observed for ≥4 months. The primary aim is to assess treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; NCI-CTCAE v4.03). Secondary endpoints include OS, progression-free survival, and tumor response. Tumor response and progression are assessed per investigator according to local standard. Results: In the interim analysis, a total of 182 pts were enrolled from Korea (n=127; 70%), China (n=48; 26%), and Taiwan (n=7; 4%). The median age was 60 years (range 21–90); 80% were male. At study entry, proportions of pts with ECOG performance status 0/1/≥2 were 37%/49%/5%; proportions with Child–Pugh A/B/C class were 70%/5%/1% (missing/not evaluable: 24%). The initial daily regorafenib dose was 160 mg in 70% of pts and 120 mg/80 mg in 14%/15%; 1 pt started at 40 mg. The mean initial daily dose was 142 mg (standard deviation 31). Median treatment duration was 3.2 months (interquartile range 1.9–9.3). The most frequent TEAEs (reported in ≥5% patients) are shown in the table. Effectiveness results will be presented. Conclusions: In this interim analysis of pts from Asia in the observational REFINE study, the TEAEs reported were consistent with those reported in the phase III RESORCE trial, although incidence rates of some TEAEs were lower than in RESORCE [Formula presented].

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2020","2020","31",,"S1310",,"1 Nov 2020","Background: Based on the phase III REFLECT study, lenvatinib (LEN) has been recommended as a first-line (1L) therapy for uHCC since 2018. Recent years have seen a further expansion of 1L treatment recommendations for uHCC, to include atezolizumab+bevacizumab, nivolumab, FOLFOX4 and donafenib. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib with other systemic therapies in first-line uHCC. Methods: A systematic literature review identified randomized, controlled, multicenter trials in adults with advanced HCC who had received no prior systemic therapy. Literature retrieval was conducted using PubMed, ScienceDirect, the Cochrane Database, EMBASE and other sources. Objective response rate (ORR), disease progression-free survival (PFS), time-to-progression (TTP) and treatment discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) were extracted from published studies and quantitatively pooled using frequentist NMA. Pairwise risk ratio(RR), hazard ratio(HR) with confidence interval was calculated. The P-scores were used to rank each treatment. Results: In total, 1398 records were screened and 27 were eligible for analysis, and the treatments included were atezolizumab+bevacizumab, brivanib, FOLFOX4, donafenib, dovitinib, lenvatinib, linifanib, nintedanib, nivolumab, sorafenib, sunitinib, vandetanib, 11 sorafenib combination therapies and three other combination therapies. For ORR and TTP, lenvatinib was ranked first (P-scores: 0.88 and 0.99), for PFS, atezolizumab+bevacizumab was ranked first followed by lenvatinib (HR: 0.89; 95% CI, 0.64-1.25; P-scores: 0.95 and 0.90) and donafinib and nivolumab ranked 5th and 6th (HR: 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.73, HR: 1.41; 95% CI, 1.13-1.76; P scores: 0.90 vs 0.59 vs 0.56 respectively). Atezolizumab+bevacizumab was associated with the highest probability of discontinuation due to AEs (RR: 1.27 [0.35-4.60]), lenvatinib ranked 4th (P scores: 0.25 and 0.39, respectively). Conclusions: This NMA suggested that greater ORR and TTP benefits with first-line use of Lenvatinib than others. Although Atezolizumab+Bevacizumab showed more benefit in PFS, more discontinuation because of AE should also take into consideration. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors.

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2020","2020","152",,"S202","S203","1 Nov 2020","Purpose or Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver tumor and the third cause of cancer death in the world. In unresectable HCC patients with intermediate-stage disease, transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) +/- co-administration of arterial chemotherapy (TACE) has shown partial responses in 15-55% of cases, and significantly delays tumor progression and vascular invasion. However while repeated courses of TAE/TACE can be administered in case of incomplete response, alternative treatment options may be considered to maximize local control. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), delivering very high doses in a limited number of fractions in a highly conformal manner, is an emerging treatment option for radical treatment of inoperable HCC and may be proposed in case of local relapse following one or more TAE/TACE courses. Material and Methods: This is a multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled, unblinded, parallel-group superiority trial of SBRT versus standard TAE/TACE for the curative treatment of intermediate stage of HCC after incomplete reponse following one TAE/TACE cycle (NCT02323360). Primary endpoint was Local Control (LC). Secondary endpoints were Progression Free-Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS) and incidence of acute and late complications. In order to detect an HR=0.18 (which translates in 45% difference at the analysis time) with a power of 80% at 5% 2 sided of the log-rank test, 18 events (approximately 50 patients, 25 per arm) are needed.

All patients received at least ≥ 1 TAE/TACE course prior to enrolment; no significant differences were found between the 2 arms with regard to prior resection (n=8, 20%), Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA, n=14, 35%) or Percutaneous Ethanol Injection (PEI, n=4, 10%). Median follow-up was 18 months (range, 2-56 months). Patients were classed stage A and B according Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system in 7 (18%) and 33 (82%) respectively. One and 2-year LC rates were 57% and 36%, with a median LC of 12 months (CI95% 16-33 months). Use of SBRT resulted in superior LC as compared to TAE/TACE (median not reached versus 8 months, p=0.0002). PFS was 29% and 16% at 1 and at 2 years, respectively. At the event of progression, 8 patients in the SBRT arm received a further TAE/TACE administration while 10 patients in the TAE/TACE arm received SBRT. OS was 96% and 90% at 1 year and at 2 years, respectively. No grade ≥3 toxicity was recorded, and no differences in overall toxicities were found between the 2 arms. [Figure Presented] Conclusion: In patients affected by unoperable HCC experiencing incomplete response following ≥1 cycle of TAE/TACE, SBRT was correlated to significantly higher LC rates as compared to rechallenge with TAE/TACE.",,,,L2010922104,10.1016/S0167-8140(21)00397-2

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2020","2020","152",,"S1019",,"1 Nov 2020","Purpose or Objective Inorganic nanoparticles (NP) activated by radiation therapy (RT) increase, in preclinical studies, radiation dose deposit within the cancer cells compared to RT alone. More recently, clinical evidence of the radiation-enhancing effects of NP begun to emerge, opening innovative fields of clinical applications in oncology. Material and Methods We performed a literature search in English and French from any year until 10 October 2019.The search term was «nanoparticle» and «radiotherapy», yielding 1270 results. Of these, we selected eleven papers related to clinical studies about the combination of RT with NP. Results Two NP are predominantly used in clinical trials: hafnium oxide and gadolinium based NP. The results of three phase 1/2 and one phase 2/3 trials all used hafnium oxide NP, involving 236 patients treated for locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity and trunk wall, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or liver tumours. Based on the data currently available, the safety profile seems manageable for the acute and transient immune reactions. No enhancement of the RT-related adverse events was identified. No serious adverse events were related to the intra-tumoural injection of the NP. Dispersion and migration evaluation by CT scan confirmed hafnium oxide NP to stay within the tumor without negatively impacting adjacent normal tissue or the reliability of the imageguided radiation therapy. As for treatment efficacy, the results of the only phase 2/3 trial available show that preoperative RT combined with hafnium oxide NP confirmed an increased proportion of pathological complete response compared with patients who received RT alone, possibly also related to an enhanced anti-tumour immune response. Currently, six phase 1/2 clinical trials are recruiting to evaluate the combination of gadoliniumbased NP and RT for the treatment of brain metastases (NCT03818386) and cervical cancer (NCT03308604); and the combination of hafnium oxide NP and RT for the treatment of head and neck cancer (NCT01946867 and NCT02901483), liver cancer (NCT02721056), rectal cancer (NCT02465593), prostate cancer (NCT02805894) and lung cancer (NCT03589339). Conclusion Overall, available results demonstrate a safe and well tolerated toxicity profile for hafnium oxide NP, with very promising early clinical results. For gadolinium based NP, results remain pending. These data open a large field of applications and justify investing in further research.",,,,L2010922932,10.1016/S0167-8140(21)01845-4

VDZ is currently an intravenous (IV) therapy; a subcutaneous (SC) formulation is under development to provide patients with an alternative route of administration for maintenance treatment for UC and CD. Here, we present the first data from the Phase III study of VDZ SC maintenance treatment in patients with CD. Methods: VISIBLE 2 (NCT02611817; EudraCT 2015-000481-58) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled Phase III trial of VDZ SC as maintenance treatment in adults with moderately to severely active CD. Patients (n = 644) received open-label VDZ 300-mg IV induction therapy at Weeks 0 and 2. At Week 6, clinical responders (defined as patients with a ≥ 70-point decrease in CD Activity Index [CDAI] from baseline) were randomly assigned to receive vedolizumab SC (108 mg every 2 weeks [Q2W]) or placebo (Q2W) for up to 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was clinical remission at Week 52 (defined as CDAI score ≤ 150). Rank-ordered secondary endpoints were enhanced clinical response at Week 52 (a drop of ≥ 100 in CDAI score), corticosteroid (CS)- free clinical remission at Week 52, and clinical remission at Week 52 in anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-naive patients. VDZ immunogenicity and predefined adverse events of special interest were also assessed. Results: Patients who responded to VDZ IV induction at Week 6 (n = 409) were randomly assigned to VDZ SC (n = 275) or PBO (n = 134) maintenance and received at least one dose of study drug; 61% and 53%, respectively, were previously exposed to anti-TNF therapy. At Week 52, 48.0% of patients receiving VDZ SC versus 34.3% receiving PBO were in clinical remission (P = 0.008; Fig. 1). Enhanced clinical response at Week 52 was reached by 52.0% of patients receiving VDZ SC versus 44.8% receiving PBO (P = 0.167). Among patients on concomitant CS at baseline (VDZ SC, n = 95; PBO, n = 44), 45.3% receiving VDZ SC versus 18.2% receiving PBO achieved CS-free clinical remission at Week 52. Of anti-TNF-naive patients (VDZ SC, n = 107; PBO, n = 63), 48.6% versus 42.9% in the VDZ SC and PBO arms, respectively, were in clinical remission at Week 52. Injection-site reactions were reported for < 3% of patients treated with VDZ SC. Rates of serious infections, malignancy, and liver injury were ≤ 5% for both arms. Anti-VDZ antibodies were detected in seven patients (2.5%) treated with VDZ SC; four of seven patients developed neutralizing antibodies. No new safety signals were observed. Conclusion: Among VDZ IV induction responders, significantly more patients receiving maintenance VDZ SC than PBO achieved clinical remission at Week 52. The safety findings with VDZ SC remain in line with the known safety profile of VDZ IV in patients with CD.",,,,L634279895,10.1111/jgh.15271

TDF and TAF are first-line treatments, and in Phase 3 studies through 3 years, TAF has shown antiviral efficacy similar to TDF, higher rates of ALT normalization, and no resistance. We evaluated HCC incidence in patients participating in these ongoing studies. Methods HBeAg-positive (n=1039) and -negative (n=593) patients with HBV DNA 20,000 IU/mL and ALT >60 U/L (males) or >38 U/L (females) were randomized (2:1) to TAF 25 mg QD or TDF 300 mg QD for up to 3 years, followed by open-label TAF through Year 8. Patients with hepatic decompensation, co-infection with HCV/HDV/HIV, or evidence of HCC were excluded. HCC was assessed at 6 monthly intervals by hepatic ultrasonography beginning after Week 96 and by local standards of care. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for HCC was calculated for observed cases relative to predicted cases using the REACH-B model. Results 1632 patients were followed for up to 4 years; HCC was seen in 16 patients (0.98%; 7 TAF; 9 TDF); median time to onset was 568 days. At baseline HCC patients were older (median age 53 vs 40 y; p<0.001), had lower median HBV DNA (6.2 vs 7.3 log(10) IU/mL; p=0.041) and were more likely to have cirrhosis (FibroTest score 0.75; 31% vs 10%; p=0.004). For study patients, the overall SIR was significantly reduced with TAF or TDF treatment 0.45 (95% CI 0.278 -0.740) (table 1). HCC incidence was significantly reduced (SIR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.75) in noncirrhotic patients (n=11 vs 26.5 predicted), but not for cirrhotic patients (n=5 vs 8.1 predicted). The SIR was significantly reduced in noncirrhotic patients receiving TAF (n=5), but not in those with TDF (n=6).

Date of Publication: 26 Oct 2020","2020","371",,,,"26 Oct 2020","Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the leading causes of cancer related death in the world. Biannual surveillance for the disease in patients with cirrhosis and in high risk carriers of hepatitis B virus allows early stage cancer detection and treatment with good long term outcomes. Liver ultrasonography and serum α fetoprotein are the most commonly used surveillance tests. If suspicious results are found on the surveillance test, multiphasic computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging should be undertaken to confirm the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. If radiologic tests show inconclusive results, liver biopsy or repeat imaging could be considered for confirmation of hepatocellular carcinoma. Management of the disease is complex. Patients should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team, and the selection of treatment should consider factors such as tumor burden, severity of liver dysfunction, medical comorbidities, local expertise, and preference of patients. Early stage hepatocellular carcinoma is best managed by curative treatment, which includes resection, ablation, or transplantation. Patients with intermediate stage disease often receive locoregional treatment. Systemic treatment is reserved for patients with advanced disease. Several positive, phase III, randomized controlled trials have expanded the systemic treatment options for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with promising long term outcomes, especially trials using combination treatments, which could also have eventual implications for the treatment of earlier stage disease.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03298451, NCT03383458, NCT03713593, NCT03755791, NCT03778957, NCT03847428, NCT03867084, NCT04039607, NCT04102098, NCT04268888)",,33106289,L633212106,10.1136/bmj.m3544

Hydrocolloid dressing is a type of wound dressing often used for wounds such as decubitus ulcers. The purpose of this study is to verify the usefulness of application of hydrocolloid dressings as prophylaxis against development of hand-foot syndrome induced by multikinase inhibitors by comparing the effects of this dressing and standard supportive care (moisturising care alone) within the same individuals. Methods This study is a phase 3 randomised, self-controlled study to compare prophylactic moisturising care with or without hydrocolloid dressing for hand-foot syndrome induced by multikinase inhibitors. Patients with radically unresectable advanced or recurrent colorectal carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumour and hepatocellular carcinoma who scheduled to receive regorafenib or sorafenib therapy are eligible for enrolment. Supportive care for hand-foot syndrome will consist of basic moisturising care with or without hydrocolloid dressing. If hand-foot syndrome occurs, a steroid ointment will be applied two times per day at the affected sites. The primary endpoint is an incidence rate of grade 2 or more severe hand-foot syndrome (soles of the feet only) assessed by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V.4.0. Grading of hand-foot syndrome will be performed by central review using photographs taken weekly by blinded trained physicians. The ethical approval was obtained from National Cancer Center Hospital. The results of this study will be submitted for publication in international peer-reviewed journals and the key findings will be presented at international scientific conference. Discussion If the positive results are found in this study, it is shown that hydrocolloid dressing is effective not only as a symptom management but also as a prevention in hand-foot syndrome induced by multikinase.

Methods: The study was a secondary analysis of individual-participant data from the phase III clinical trial NCT00699374. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to evaluate the association between baseline PPI use and survival outcomes. Overall survival (OS) was the primary outcome with progression-free survival (PFS) secondary. Results: In a cohort of 542 advanced HCC patients initiating sorafenib treatment, 122 were concomitantly using a PPI at baseline.

Accordingly, this phase 3 study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tivantinib as a second-line treatment for Japanese patients with MET-high hepatocellular carcinoma. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at 60 centers in Japan. Hepatocellular carcinoma patients with one prior sorafenib treatment and those with MET-high tumor samples were eligible for inclusion.

Methods: The phase 3, open-label GEMINI LTS study (initiated May 2009) enrolled patients with UC or CD from four prior clinical trials and vedolizumab-naïve patients. Vedolizumab LTS was evaluated; efficacy and patient-reported outcomes were exploratory endpoints. Results: Enrolled patients (UC, n = 894; CD, n = 1349) received vedolizumab 300 mg IV every 4 weeks; median cumulative exposure was 42.4 months (range: 0.03-112.2) for UC and 31.5 months (range: 0.03-100.3) for CD.

Lusutrombopag is an agonist of the thrombopoietin receptor that activates platelet production. Methods: We performed an integrated analysis of data from 2 phase 3 trials (L-PLUS 1, Japan, October 2013 to May 2014, and L-PLUS 2, global, June 2015 to April 2017) that compared the efficacy and safety of lusutrombopag with placebo in patients with chronic liver disease, with and without HCC. Our analysis included patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group grades of 0 or 1, Child–Pugh classes A or B, and a platelet count less than 50 × 10(9)/L who were scheduled to undergo invasive procedures in 9 to 14 days. Patients received lusutrombopag (3 mg) or placebo daily for 7 days or fewer before an invasive procedure. Imaging studies assessed treatment-emergent adverse events, including asymptomatic portal vein thrombosis. The primary end point was no requirement for platelet transfusion before the invasive procedure and rescue therapies for bleeding 7 days or fewer after the invasive procedure. Results: The per-protocol population included 270 patients (95 with HCC). A significantly higher proportion of patients with HCC who received lusutrombopag achieved the primary end point (68.0%) vs patients who received placebo (8.9%) (P < .0001); in patients without HCC, these proportions were 77.0% vs 21.6% (P < .0001).

In the last years, new molecular-targeted therapies, such as cabozantinib have been approved for the treatment of advanced HCC. However, clinical experience with the new drugs in the treatment of HCC in the setting of a LT is very limited, since these patients are excluded from the phase 3 trials. Methods: In this report, we present the case of a 36-year-old woman who received 2003 a living donor LT due to a multifocal inoperable HCC in a noncirrhotic liver out of Milan criteria. Results: Seven years later, a pulmonary and intrahepatic recurrence of the HCC was diagnosed and histologically confirmed. Following an interdisciplinary therapy concept consisting of surgical-, interventional-radiological as well as systemic treatment, the patient has achieved a survival of more than 10 years after diagnosis of tumor recurrence. A systemic first line therapy with sorafenib was accompanied by grade 3-4 toxicities, such as mucositis, hand-foot skin reaction, diarrhea, liver dysfunction and hyperthyroidism, and had to be discontinued. After the switch to cabozantinib from June 2018 to April 2020, a partial remission of all tumor manifestations was achieved. The therapy with cabozantinib was well tolerated, only mild arterial hypertension and grade 1-2 mucositis where observed, which could be easily managed. Liver transplant function was stable during the therapy, no drug interaction with immunosuppressive drugs was observed. Conclusion: In conclusion, this report highlights the tolerability and effectiveness of cabozantinib for the treatment of HCC recurrence after LT. To our knowledge, this is the first case reporting clinical experience with cabozantinib in this setting.

To align with RESORCE, the CELESTIAL population was limited to patients who received first-line sorafenib only. To minimize potential effect-modifying population differences, the CELESTIAL IPD were weighted to balance the distribution of clinically relevant baseline characteristics with those of RESORCE. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated for the matching-adjusted second-line CELESTIAL population and compared to those for RESORCE using weighted Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and parametric modelling. Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events affecting > 5% of patients in any trial arm were compared. Results: The MAIC included 573 RESORCE patients and an effective sample size of 266 from CELESTIAL. Weighted KM estimates for median (95% confidence interval [CI]) OS were similar for the matching-adjusted cabozantinib and regorafenib populations (11.4 [8.9-17.0] vs. 10.6 [9.1-12.1] months; p = 0.3474, log-rank test). Estimated median (95% CI) PFS was longer for cabozantinib than regorafenib (5.6 [4.9-7.3] vs. 3.1 [2.8-4.2] months; p = 0.0005, log-rank test). As visual inspection of the log-cumulative hazard plots for OS and PFS revealed non-parallelism, and statistical tests confirmed that the proportional hazards assumption was not satisfied, anchored hazard ratios were not justified. Parametric models were therefore fitted, and generated survival estimates mirroring those of the weighted KM analysis. Comparative estimates for some grade 3/4 TEAEs were affected by low incidence; only rates of grade 3/4 diarrhea were significantly different, favouring regorafenib (p ≤ 0.001). Conclusions: Cabozantinib may achieve similar OS and prolonged PFS compared with regorafenib in patients with progressive aHCC after prior sorafenib; grade 3/4 diarrhea rates maybe lower with regorafenib. MAIC analyses cannot replace randomized clinical trials, but may help to guide decision making in the absence of direct trial evidence.",,,,L634192534,10.1177/0300891620953388

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2020","2020","43",,"123","124","1 Oct 2020","Introduction: Hepatic resection and ablation are standard-of-care for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but though these approaches are potentially curative, the risk of recurrence is high (44%-79% at 5 years). No efective adjuvant therapy with strong evidence currently exists and the prevention and/or delay of recurrence of HCC afer curative treatment presents a high unmet medical need. Encouraging evidence suggests that adjuvant therapy involving agents that engage the immune response, including immunotherapy such as dur-valumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody), can prolong recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with early-stage HCC. Additionally, VEGF pathway inhibition may enhance activity of PD-L1 blockade in patients with HCC. EMERALD-2 (NCT03847428) is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of durvalumab with or without bevacizumab as adjuvant therapy in patients at high risk of recurrence afer curative resection or ablation. Methods: Approximately 888 patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to Arm A (durvalumab + bevacizumab), Arm B (durvalumab + placebo), or Arm C (placebo + placebo) within 12 weeks of completion of curative hepatic resection, or final curative ablation procedure (which may include embo-lization). Stratifcation will be based upon evidence of pathological mi-crovascular invasion and geographic region. Eligible patients must have confrmed HCC, successfully completed curative therapy with imaging to confrm disease-free status ≤28 days prior to randomization, ECOG PS 0-1, and Child-Pugh score of 5 or 6. Patients are required to have an upper endoscopy (or contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging) performed within 6 months of randomization; patients with varices at risk of bleeding should be excluded. A tumor tissue sample is mandatory for biomarker analysis. Exclusion criteria include prior systemic anticancer therapy for HCC; known fbrolamellar HCC, sarcomatoid HCC, or mixed cholangiocarcinoma and HCC; extrahepatic HCC, macrovascular invasion, or co-existing malignant disease at baseline; waiting for liver transplantation. Patients with active (controlled) or past hepatiThis virus B or C infection may be enrolled. The primary endpoint is RFS as assessed by blinded independent central radiology review using RECIST v1.1.

Cabozantinib (C), a multikinase inhibitor, has shown promising activity following IO agents in advanced renal cell carcinoma. For aHCC, C improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) vs placebo (P) in patients (pts) previously treated with sorafenib in the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial. Unlike other pivotal phase 3 trials in this setting, CELESTIAL allowed up to 2 prior regimens for aHCC. In this exploratory analysis, we assess the clinical activity of C in pts in CELESTIAL who received prior sorafenib and IO therapy. Methods: As of June 2017, 707 pts were randomized 2:1 to C (60 mg QD) or P. Eligible pts were Child-Pugh A, ECOG PS 0-1, must have received prior sorafenib, and could have received up to 2 prior regimens for aHCC. Outcomes were evaluated for pts who received prior IO therapy, using a data cutof of December 2017 to allow for extended follow-up. Results: 130 pts in the C arm and 62 pts in the P arm received 2 prior regimens for aHCC; among these pts, 14 in the C arm and 3 in the P arm received prior IO therapy as well as the required sorafenib. In the C arm, 9pts had received nivolumab (2 in combination with ipilimumab), 4 had received pembrolizumab, and 1 had received durvalumab. In the prior 10subgroup, median OS with C was 7.9 months (mo) (95% CI, 5.1-not estimable), and median PFS was 3.7 mo (95% CI, 1.9-5.6), while in the overall 2 prior regimen subgroup, median OS with C was 8.5 mo (95% CI, 7.4-9.7), and median PFS was 3.7 mo (95% CI, 3.3-4.1). In the prior IO subgroup, the median duration of exposure to C was 3.7 mo (range 1.9-18.7), 9 pts (64%) experienced a grade 3/4 adverse event (AE), and 1 pt (7%) discontinued due to a treatment-related AE. In the overall 2 prior regimen subgroup, the median duration of exposure to C was 3.7 mo (range 0.5-23.9), 85 pts (66%) experienced a grade 3/4 AE, and 19 pts (15%) discontinued due to a treatment-related AE. Conclusions: Pts with aHCC previously treated with anti-VEGF and IO therapy had similar outcomes on C to other pts who received 2 prior regimens, suggesting clinical activity and tolerability of C in pts previously treated with IO.",,,,L640123410,10.1159/000510995

In the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial (NCT01908426), C signifcantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) vs P in pts with previously treated advanced HCC. Here we evaluate clinical outcomes with C in the CELESTIAL trial based on AFP response or progression on treatment. Methods: 707 pts were randomized 2:1 to receive C (60 mg qd) or P. Eligible patients had a pathologic diagnosis of HCC, Child-Pugh score A, and ECOG PS ≤1. Pts received prior sorafenib and up to 2 lines of prior systemic therapy for HCC. Serum AFP levels were measured centrally at b and every 8 weeks thereafer. Outcomes were evaluated for pts with elevated b serum AFP (≥20 ng/mL) based on AFP response (≥20% decrease from b) or progression (≥20% increase from b) at week 8. Results: Overall, 331 pts (70%) in the C arm and 160 (68%) in the P arm had elevated b AFP levels, and 236 (50%) and 111 (47%), respectively, were evaluable for AFP response at Week 8. Among evaluable pts, 117 pts (50%) in the C arm vs 14 (13%) in the P arm had an AFP response and 72 (31%) vs 75 (68%), respectively, had AFP progression.

For pts with AFP progression, median OS with C was 8.1 mo, and median PFS with C was 3.6 mo. Hazard ratios for OS and PFS with C also favored AFP responders over non-responders when analyzed according to best response through week 24 or using 50% decrease from b as the cutof for response. Conclusions: AFP response rate was higher with C vs P, and AFP response was associated with longer OS and PFS with C for pts with previously treated advanced HCC.

We present data from an interim analysis of this cohort. Methods: This open-label, single-arm, global OLE study investigates ra-mucirumab in patients with advanced HCC (BCLC stage C/B), Child-Pugh (CP) A, ECOG PS 0/1, and baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL who received 1-2 prior systemic therapy regimens for HCC (excluding sorafenib or chemotherapy). Approximately 44 patients will receive ramucirumab 8 mg/kg i.v. Q2W. The primary endpoint is safety; secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and patient-reported outcomes. The final analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints will occur afer all patients have completed at least 3 cycles of ramucirumab or discontinued. Results: As of the interim data cutof (31 January 2020), 24 patients were enrolled, 96% male, median baseline AFP of 2094 ng/mL (IQR: 854, 7981), 50% ECOG PS 0, 96% CP A, 67% ALBI grade 1, and 92% BCLC stage C disease. The most common prior systemic therapies were lenvatinib (n=8), PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy (n=9), PD-1 inhibitor plus lenvatinib (n=3), and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (n=3). Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 14 (58%) of 24 patients and were deemed by the investigator to be related to treatment in 4 (17%) patients. Grade ≥3 TEAEs reported in ≥10% of patients were hypertension (n=4; 17%), proteinuria (n=3; 13%), and pneumonia (n=3; 13%). No deaths due to AEs occurred on therapy or within 30 days of treatment discontinuation. With a median follow-up of 6.5 months (range: 1.2-20.7), the median PFS was 5.5 months (18 events; 95% CI 1.3-7.5). The ORR was 16.7% (95% CI: 1.8-31.6). Median OS was immature with only 10 events. Conclusions: At this interim analysis, the safety and efficacy profle of ramucirumab following a non-sorafenib based systemic therapy was consistent with that observed in patients who received prior sorafenib in the ITT population of REACH-2.

We analyzed outcomes by baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and on-treatment AFP changes. Patients and Methods: Serum AFP was measured every 8 weeks by blinded, centralized testing. Outcomes were analyzed by baseline AFP bifurcated at 400 ng/mL and by on-treatment AFP response (≥20% decrease from baseline at Week 8). The optimal cutoff for change in AFP at Week 8 was evaluated using maximally selected rank statistics. Results: Median OS for cabozantinib versus placebo was 13.9 versus 10.3 months [HR, 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.62-1.04] for patients with baseline AFP <400 ng/mL, and 8.5 versus 5.2 months (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.94) for patients with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL.

The canonical HH pathway functions through major HH molecules such as HH ligands, PTCH, SMO and GLI, whereas the noncanonical HH pathway involves the activation of SMO or GLI through other pathways. The role of SMO has been discussed in different types of cancer, including breast, liver, pancreatic and colon cancers. SMO expression correlates with tumor size, invasiveness, metastasis and recurrence. In addition, SMO inhibitors can suppress cancer formation, reduce the proliferation of cancer cells, trigger apoptosis and suppress cancer stem cell activity. A better understanding of the role of SMO in cancer could contribute to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00878163, NCT00880308, NCT01106508, NCT01267955, NCT01546038, NCT01842646, NCT01878617, NCT02367456, NCT02465060, NCT02530437, NCT02784795, NCT02925234, NCT03158389, NCT03297606, NCT03390296, NCT03416179, NCT03434262, NCT03466450, NCT03498521, NCT03610022, NCT03734913, NCT04007744, NCT04051996, NCT04155190, NCT04231851, NCT04308395, NCT04341181)",,32962123,L2005101778,10.3390/ijms21186863

However, results of phase III clinical trials revealed that only a subfraction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients respond to therapy and display only moderate objective response rates. Further, predictive molecular characteristics are largely missing. In consequence, suitable trial design has emerged as a crucial factor for the success of a novel compound. In addition, increasing knowledge from translational studies indicate the importance of targeting the tumor immune environment to overcome resistance to immunotherapy. Thus, combination of different immunotherapies with other treatment modalities including antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or local therapies is highly promising. However, the mechanisms of failure to respond to immunotherapy in liver cancer are still not fully understood and the modulation of the immune system and cellular tumor composition is particularly relevant in this context. Altogether, it is increasingly clear that tailoring of immunotherapy and individualized approaches are required to improve efficacy and patient outcome in liver cancer.

Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach in specialized clinics is required for the optimal management of HCC patients. Almost half of patients present with advanced stage tumor with no curative therapeutic options. According to international guidelines, palliative systemic therapy is recommended in these patients. The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib was the first drug to show antitumor efficacy and was the only approved treatment for almost a decade, as several other agents failed to improve patients’ survival. In recent years, treatment practices have changed with lenvatinib as another first-line treatment choice and regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab as second-line therapeutic options. However, only patients with preserved liver function (Child–Pugh A) were enrolled in these studies and are consequently suitable for these drugs. After promising phase I and II studies, subsequent phase III trials evaluating the immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab failed to demonstrate a significant improvement in patients’ overall and progression-free survival. Recently, in a phase III trial, the combination therapy atezolizumab and bevacizumab led to a significantly improved overall survival compared to sorafenib in the first-line setting.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2020","2020","31",,"S839","S840","1 Sep 2020","Background: In RELAY, a dose of RAM 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) was selected based on exposure-response analysis, using data from second-line (2L) phase 3 studies investigating RAM 8 mg/kg Q2W in gastric and hepatic cancer and 10 mg/kg Q3W in NSCLC. Data from these studies showed that patients with the higher RAM exposure (C(min,1) or C(min,ss)) experienced improved efficacy (Tabernero J et al. Mol Cancer Ther. 2017;16:2215-22). Consequently, RELAY used 10 mg/kg Q2W with the goal of optimizing exposure and response. Here we present the exposure–response relationship of RAM from RELAY. Methods: Patients received RAM (10 mg/kg, N=216) or P (N=225) Q2W plus ERL (150 mg/day). A population pharmacokinetic model predicted RAM minimum concentration after first dose (C(min,1)), and at steady state (C(min,ss)), which were used to evaluate correlation between RAM exposure and efficacy (primary end point, PFS, analyzed using multivariate Cox regression by C(min,1) quartiles, and case-matched controls) and safety (incidence rates for safety parameters by quartiles, with ordered categorical model used for ALT/AST only). Results: As expected, RAM 10 mg/kg Q2W delivered C(min,ss) equivalent to the upper C(min,ss) quartile levels achieved in 2L NSCLC (RAM 10 mg/kg Q3W) in ≥70 % of patients. RAM+ERL patients had superior PFS relative to P+ERL patients. No exposure-efficacy relationship was identified in RELAY: PFS HR (mean, 95% CI) for the C(min,1) quartiles were 0.67 (0.45-0.99), 0.77 (0.53-1.12), 0.57 (0.38-0.84), and 0.50 (0.33-0.76). No apparent exposure-safety relationship was observed for selected safety endpoints, including Grade ≥3 TEAEs (hypertension, diarrhea, dermatitis acneiform) and AESIs (any grade hypertension, any grade and Grade ≥3 proteinuria, and any grade ALT/AST increased within liver failure/liver injury). Conclusions: The recommended 10 mg/kg Q2W RAM dose combined with ERL (150 mg/day) is an efficacious and safe 1L treatment for EGFR-mutated, metastatic NSCLC. RAM exposure was increased compared to that in previous phase 3 trials using 10 mg/kg Q3W. These data suggest that RAM IV 10 mg/kg Q2W with ERL is an optimized dosing regimen for this indication.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2020","2020","31",,"S696","S697","1 Sep 2020","Background: Albumin/bilirubin (ALBI) score measures liver function in HCC using objective laboratory variables. KEYNOTE-240 (NCT02702401) was a phase III study in pts with previously treated, advanced HCC that demonstrated reduced risk of death with pembrolizumab (pembro) vs placebo (pbo), but prespecified significance criteria were not met. We hypothesized that deterioration of liver function, as measured by change in ALBI score, would not be adversely affected by pembro vs pbo. Methods: Eligible pts had confirmed HCC, progression on/intolerance to sorafenib, Child-Pugh A disease, and ECOG performance status 0-1. Pts were randomized 2:1 to pembro 200 mg or pbo IV every 3 wk + best supportive care for ≤35 cycles or until confirmed progression/unacceptable toxicity. This post hoc analysis assessed change from BL in ALBI score and time to increase in ALBI grade in both arms. Efficacy was assessed in ALBI grade 1 and 2 subgroups. Data cutoff: 2 Jan 2019. Results: Of 413 pts, 116 had BL ALBI grade 1 (pembro, n=74; pbo, n=42) and 279 had BL ALBI grade 2 (pembro, n=193; pbo, n=86). Change from BL in ALBI score to the end of treatment was similar in both arms (difference in least-squares mean –0.037; 95% CI –0.167, 0.093). Time to ALBI grade increase was similar in both arms (median 7.8 mo on pembro vs 6.9 mo on pbo; hazard ratio [HR] 0.863 [95% CI 0.625, 1.192]) (Table). Regardless of BL ALBI grade, pembro improved overall survival (OS; grade 1: HR 0.725 [95% CI 0.454, 1.158]; grade 2: HR 0.827 [95% CI 0.612, 1.119]). Conclusions: Liver function in pts with HCC as measured by change in ALBI score from BL was not adversely affected by pembro vs pbo. Time to ALBI grade increase was similar in both arms. OS benefit with pembro was observed in both ALBI grade groups. [Formula presented] Clinical trial identification: NCT02702401, March 8, 2016.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2020","2020","31",,"S702",,"1 Sep 2020","Background: Ramucirumab (an IgG1 vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 antagonist) is the first and only treatment approved in a biomarker-selected population with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ramucirumab was approved in HCC based on data from patients with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels ≥400 ng/mL in the phase III REACH (NCT01140347) and REACH-2 (NCT02435433) studies. Similar to other contemporary studies, the REACH-2 intention-to-treat (ITT) population did not include patients who received first-line systemic therapy other than sorafenib, since sorafenib was the only treatment with demonstrated overall survival (OS) benefit when the studies were initiated. This global, open-label expansion (OLE) cohort of REACH-2 was initiated to study ramucirumab in patients with advanced HCC and baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL following non-sorafenib based systemic therapy. Trial design: This single-arm, open-label, global OLE investigates ramucirumab in patients with advanced HCC who received 1-2 lines of prior systemic therapy for HCC other than sorafenib or chemotherapy (i.e. a tyrosine kinase inhibitor as monotherapy or in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor). Eligible patients will have Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C or B disease (refractory or not amenable to locoregional therapy), Child-Pugh class A liver disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0/1, and baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL. Patients who received a prior liver transplant are eligible. Approximately 44 patients will be enrolled to receive ramucirumab 8 mg/kg intravenously once every 14 days. The primary objective is safety. Secondary objectives are OS, progression-free survival, time to radiographic progression, objective response rate, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and patient-reported outcomes. All analyses of the OLE will be independent of the main randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled ITT cohort of REACH-2. Clinical trial identification: NCT02435433.

Lenvatinib, an inhibitor of VEGFRs 1-3, FGFRs 1-4, PDGFR α, RET, and KIT, is a first-line option for advanced HCC. Pembrolizumab is a PD-1 inhibitor; data from a phase Ib trial of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab showed broad antitumor activity and manageable safety in patients with unresectable intermediate HCC not amenable to TACE. LEAP-012 (NCT04246177) is a randomized, double-blind, phase III trial to investigate lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab vs placebo in combination with TACE in patients with intermediate HCC. Trial design: Eligible patients are ≥18 y with confirmed HCC localized to the liver without portal vein thrombosis and not amenable to curative treatment. Patients must have ≥1 measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1 and ECOG PS of 0/1. Patients previously treated with locoregional therapy (≤4 weeks) or systemic chemotherapy for HCC are excluded. Approximately 950 patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive oral lenvatinib QD (12 mg ≥60 kg; 8 mg <60 kg) plus IV pembrolizumab 400 mg Q6W plus TACE or oral placebo QD plus IV placebo Q6W plus TACE. Lenvatinib will be administered until progression or unacceptable toxicity; pembrolizumab will be administered for up to 2 years. TACE is limited to 2 treatments per lesion per site-specified modality. Patients will be stratified by study site, α-fetoprotein level, ECOG PS, albumin–bilirubin grade, and tumor burden. Imaging will be performed every 9 weeks. Safety will be assessed throughout the study. Coprimary end points are overall survival and progression-free survival. Secondary end points are objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, time to progression, and safety. Exploratory end points include time from randomization to second/subsequent progression, molecular biomarkers, and health-related quality of life. Recruitment for this study began in April 2020.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2020","2020","31",,"S703",,"1 Sep 2020","Background: For patients with HCC undergoing potentially curative surgical resection or local ablation, 5-year recurrence rates are between 50% and 80%; there is currently no standard of care for adjuvant treatment. Pembrolizumab, a programmed death 1 inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of patients with HCC who have previously received sorafenib. There is currently no direct evidence of benefit with pembrolizumab in the HCC adjuvant setting, but a favorable benefit/risk profile is anticipated based on data from other indications. KEYNOTE-937 (NCT03867084) is a randomized, double-blind, phase III trial designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of adjuvant pembrolizumab versus placebo in patients with HCC who have had a complete radiologic response after surgical resection or local ablation. Trial design: Eligible patients are aged ≥18 yrs with confirmed HCC, complete radiologic response after complete resection or local ablation, ECOG performance status of 0, and class A Child-Pugh score. Patients with past or ongoing HCV or controlled HBV are eligible if they meet prespecified criteria. Approximately 950 patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo IV every 3 weeks. Treatment will continue for up to 17 cycles (∼1 year) or until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. Patients will be stratified by geographic region, prior local therapy (resection vs ablation), recurrence risk, and alpha-fetoprotein level at diagnosis. Co-primary end points are recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Secondary end points are safety and tolerability and health-related quality of life. Exploratory end points include distant metastases-free survival; time to recurrence; and genomic, metabolic, and/or proteomic biomarkers. Tumor imaging will be performed every 12 weeks until recurrence or Week 228 (∼year 4), whichever occurs first.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2020","2020","31",,"S699",,"1 Sep 2020","Background: In the phase III RESORCE trial, regorafenib improved overall survival (OS) vs placebo in pts with uHCC who progressed on sorafenib. The international, prospective REFINE study was designed to evaluate regorafenib in pts with uHCC in routine practice. We present interim results for pts enrolled in REFINE in Korea, China, and Taiwan. Methods: REFINE is an ongoing observational study that recruited patients with uHCC for whom a decision to treat with regorafenib was made by the treating physician prior to enrollment according to the local health authority approved label. A planned interim analysis was performed when the first 500 pts in the global cohort had been observed for ≥4 months. The primary aim is to assess treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; NCI-CTCAE v4.03). Secondary endpoints include OS, progression-free survival, and tumor response. Tumor response and progression are assessed per investigator according to local standard. Results: In the interim analysis, a total of 182 pts were enrolled from Korea (n=127; 70%), China (n=48; 26%), and Taiwan (n=7; 4%). The median age was 60 years (range 21–90); 80% were male. At study entry, proportions of pts with ECOG performance status 0/1/≥2 were 37%/49%/5%; proportions with Child–Pugh A/B/C class were 70%/5%/1% (missing/not evaluable: 24%). The initial daily regorafenib dose was 160 mg in 70% of pts and 120 mg/80 mg in 14%/15%; 1 pt started at 40 mg. The mean initial daily dose was 142 mg (standard deviation 31). Median treatment duration was 3.2 months (interquartile range 1.9–9.3). The most frequent TEAEs (reported in ≥5% patients) are shown in the table. Effectiveness results will be presented. Conclusions: In this interim analysis of pts from Asia in the observational REFINE study, the TEAEs reported were consistent with those reported in the phase III RESORCE trial, although incidence rates of some TEAEs were lower than in RESORCE.

LEN, a multi-kinase inhibitor of VEGFR 1-3, FGFR 1-4, PDGFRα, RET, and KIT, is approved for the treatment of 1L uHCC in multiple countries. Here we report the preliminary efficacy and safety from a phase Ib trial of CS1003 + LEN in 1L uHCC. Methods: In this open-label phase Ib study, pts with 1L uHCC, BCLC stage B or C, Child-Pugh class A, and ECOG PS ≤ 1 received 200 mg CS1003 intravenously once every 3 weeks and LEN orally (body weight ≥ 60 kg: 12 mg/day; < 60 kg: 8 mg/day) daily. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was monitored during the first cycle in Part 1. Additional pts were enrolled in Part 2 for efficacy expansion. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by investigators per RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included safety and other efficacy parameters. Results: As of 21 Mar 2020, no DLTs were reported in Part 1. A total of 19 pts were treated (Part 1, n=8; Part 2, n=11) and 17 remained on study treatment. The median treatment duration of CS1003/LEN was 15.0 (range: 0.7-27.4) weeks. Among the 16 efficacy-evaluable pts, ORR was 37.5% with 6 pts achieving partial response (3 confirmed); duration of response (DoR) ranged from 0.03+ to 4.17+ months, and median DoR was not reached. Tumor shrinkage was observed in 6 of the 7 pts with stable disease. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 16 pts (84.2%). The most common TRAEs were hypothyroidism (n=5), platelet count decreased (n=5) and protein urine present (n=5). CTCAE Grade (G) ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 3 pts (15.8%). One pt had a G3 bilirubin conjugated increased that was attributed to both CS1003 and LEN. The other two pts had a G3 diarrhoea and a G3 hypophosphataemia, respectively, that were only related to LEN. No new safety signals were identified. Conclusions: The CS1003 + LEN combination shows promising antitumor activity and an acceptable safety profile in Chinese pts with 1L uHCC.

In a previous phase II study we found HAIC with FOLFOX yielded a higher treatment response versus TACE in patients with large unresectable HCC. Here we report results from a phase III trial of HAIC with FOLFOX versus TACE. Methods: In this randomised, multi-centre, open-label trial, adults (≥18 years) with a primary unresectable HCC tumour with a largest diameter ≥7 cm, without macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread were randomised 1:1 to HAIC (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2), leucovorin 400 mg/m(2), fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m(2) on day 1, and fluorouracil infusion 2400 mg/m(2) for 24 hours, every 3 weeks via repeated catheterization) or TACE (50 mg of epirubicin, 50 mg of lobaplatin, and lipiodol and polyvinyl alcohol particles). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) using RECIST, progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Treatment response was also assessed using mRECIST. Treatment outcomes were evaluated in an intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in patients who received ≥1 cycle of study treatment. Results: A total of 315 patients were randomised to HAIC (n=159) or TACE (n=156). The cut-off for the present analysis was April 2020 and patient follow-up is on-going. Median OS was higher for patients receiving HAIC versus TACE: 23.1 months (95% CI, 18.23–27.97) versus 16.07 months (95% CI, 14.26–17.88); hazard ratio (HR), 0.58 (95% CI, 0.45−0.75; P <0.001). Compared with the TACE group, patients in the HAIC group had a higher ORR (RECIST: 45.9 [73] vs. 17.9% [28], P <0.001; mRECIST: 48.4 [77] vs. 32.7% [51], P=0.004), and a longer median PFS (9.63 [95% CI, 7.40−11.86] vs. 5.40 [95% CI, 3.82−6.98] months; P <0.001). More patients in the HAIC group underwent subsequent resection compared with the TACE group (23.8 [38] vs. 11.5% [18], P=0.004). The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the TACE group versus the HAIC group (30 vs 19%, P=0.03).

In the phase Ib study GO30140, atezo + bev statistically significantly increased PFS vs atezo. We present efficacy data from GO30140 patients who crossed over to atezo + bev following progression on atezo. Methods: In GO30140 Arm F, 119 patients with unresectable HCC were randomised 1:1 to atezo 1200 mg IV + bev 15 mg/kg IV q3w (Arm F1) or atezo 1200 mg IV q3w (Arm F2). Patients in Arm F2 could cross over to atezo + bev after disease progression (PD) per RECIST 1.1. Investigator-assessed PFS and objective response rate (ORR) following crossover were evaluated. Results: At the data cut on 14 June 2019, 26 of 59 patients in Arm F2 crossed over to atezo + bev following PD after a median 2.5-mo exposure to atezo monotherapy. Crossover patients’ baseline demographics were comparable with those of patients in Arms F2 and F1. With a median follow-up of 4.0 mo post crossover, 1 patient had a partial response (PR) with atezo + bev (ORR 3.8% vs 0% with atezo pre-crossover). The disease control rate was 53.8% with atezo + bev vs 30.8% with atezo pre-crossover.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2020","2020","31",,"S694",,"1 Sep 2020","Background: ICIs exhibited moderate anti-tumor activity in HCC. The failures of phase III trials evaluating the benefits from nivolumab or pembrolizumab vs. sorafenib suggested the necessity to investigate predictive biomarkers. The PD-L1 expression in tumor cells showed varied trends of association with ICI response in multiple trials. Here, this meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effect size of PD-L1 expression in predicting response to ICI therapy. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library for the trials of ICI in HCC with PD-L1 assessment. Random-effects model were used to pool estimates of risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of objective response. Subgroup analysis were implemented to investigate the source of heterogeneity. Results: In total, 9 eligible trials of 894 patients with data of PD-L1 expression and response were included. Of these, PD-L1 positivity was observed in 178 patients (19.9%). Pooled estimate of all trials revealed the positive association between PD-L1 positivity and objective response to ICI (RR=1.70, 95%CI 1.17-2.47, P=0.006), and the heterogeneity level was low (Tau(2)=0.00, I(2)=0.00%) and non-significant (P=0.76). This effect was minimal in trials of anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA4 combination therapy (RR=1.21, 95%CI 0.53-2.74, P=0.65) but remarkable in trials of anti-PD-1 monotherapy (RR=1.86, 95%CI 1.22-2.83, P=0.004). [Formula presented] Conclusions: PD-L1 protein expression was associated with better response to ICI treatment, especially anti-PD-1 monotherapy. Minimal association between PD-L1 positivity and response to combination therapy might be account of the boost anti-tumor immunity by the addition of anti-CTLA-4, which warrants further investigations.

Considering the discrepancies in patients between clinical trial data and daily practice, an account of practical experience is needed. Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis in which 3 tertiary referral centers participated. A total of 92 patients with advanced HCC treated with lenvatinib between September 2018 and January 2020 were analyzed. Results: Lenvatinib was used as the first-line therapy for 67 (72.8%) patients, and for 25 (27.2%) patients previously treated with other systemic therapy including immune checkpoint inhibitors. At the time of initiation of lenvatinib, 74 (80.4%) and 18 (19.6%) patients were classified as Child-Pugh A and B, respectively. Thirty-five patients (38.0%) had extensive disease that would have excluded them from the REFLECT trial. In the Child-Pugh A group, the response rate graded according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 was 21.1%, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.1-6.1) months, and overall survival (OS) was 10.7 (95% CI 4.8-16.5) months for patients treated with first-line lenvatinib (n = 57).

"Genome-wide CRISPR/CAS9 library screening identified PAK1 as a critical driver for lenvatinib resistance in HCC","Huang S., Zhang C., Hou B., Wu L.","Transplantation (2020) 104:SUPPL 3 (S42). Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2020","2020","104","SUPPL 3","S42",,"1 Sep 2020","Background: In a global, phase III, open-label, noninferiority trial (REFLECT), lenvatinib demonstrated noninferiority to sorafenib in overall survival and a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, lenvatinib became the first agent in more than 10 years to receive approval as first-line therapy for unresectable HCC, along with the previously approved sorafenib. Over the past decade, sorafenib has been the only systemic agent with proven clinical efficacy for patients with unresectable HCC and recurrent HCC post liver transplantation. However, the development of drug resistance of lenvatinib is becoming common. Methods: The genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screen is a powerful tool used to identify therapeutic targets that can be harnessed for cancer treatment. Here, we performed the first genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screening on lenvatinib-treated HCC cells to identify essential genes for non-mutational mechanisms related to acquired lenvatinib resistance and/or sensitivity in HCC cells. A genomescale CRISPR knockout (mGeCKOa) library containing 123,411 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) was used to identify loss-of-function mutations conferring lenvatinib resistance upon HCC cells. The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus datasets were analyzed to identify gene expression. Immunohistochemistry staining, western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to evaluate PAK1 expression in samples. Cell count Kit-8, wound-healing, transwell and flow cytometry assays were used to analyze HCC cell progression. Subcutaneous xenotransplantation models were used to investigate the role of PAK1 in vivo. Result: By using genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 library screening, we identify p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), a family member of serine/threonine p21-activating kinases, as a critical driver for lenvatinib resistance. Resistance gene screens identified loss of PAK1 as an indicator of prognosis of patients treated with lenvatinib. The knockout screen identified inhibition of PAK1 expression as the most-effective genetic suppressor of lenvatinib activity. Analysis of the survival of 110 patients with HCC after hepatic resection revealed that low PAK1 expression shortened overall and tumor-free survival (P <0.001). Further, matched pairs analysis of the TCGA database revealed that PAK1 is differentially expressed. When we used a lentivirus Cas9 vector to determine the effect of targeting PAK1 with a specific sgRNA in HCC cells, we found that PAK1 expression was efficiently inhibited and that loss of PAK1 was associated with lenvatinib resistance. Further, loss of PAK1 from HCC cell increased the cytotoxicity of lenvatinib in vivo. Lenvatinib treatment activates series of metabolism, including 'Glycolysis/ Gluconeogenesis, Cysteine and methionine metabolism, Selenocompound metabolism, Sphingolipid metabolism, Pyruvate metabolism, Metabolic pathways'. With RNAi knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout models, we show that loss of PAK1 activates the Glycolysis/ Gluconeogenesis and increase the production related metabolites. Concomitantly, activation of PAK1 reduces ROS level and HCC apoptosis upon Lenvatinib treatment. Conclusions: We conclude that the CRISPR screen is a powerful tool for therapeutic target analysis of lenvatinib treatment and that PAK1 serves as a druggable target for HCC treated with lenvatinib and an indicator of prognosis. In summary, our results demonstrate that targeting PAK1 is an effective approach to overcome lenvatinib drug resistance in HCC.",,,,L633378816,10.1097/01.tp.0000698460.16155.43

In a randomized phase 3 trial, it was demonstrated that lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in first-line advanced HCC. The most common adverse events were hypertension (68.6%), diarrhea (62.8%), anorexia (51.5%) and weight reduction (49.1%). In the phase 3 select study, hypertension was reported in 72.8% of treated patients, the median time to onset in treated patients was 16 days. Materials and Methods: We selected three patients affected by HCC, classified on the basis of Child Class and staged by BCLC criteria; all of them underwent to previous ablative treatment. To our evaluation all patients presented advanced stage (BCLC B-C), no longer candidates for loco-regional therapies, Child-Pugh class A and performance status 0; all aged > 65 years. Among the comorbidities, all patients had hypertension. In one patient with no pressure control, anti-hypertensive therapy was increased, obtaining normal values before starting lenvatinib. Following guidelines, they were submitted to oral Lenvatinib therapy (12 mg /day for bodyweight ≥60 Kg or 8 mg /day for bodyweight ≤60 kg) as first-line strategy, with the recommendation to monitor blood pressure. Results: After about 20 days from the start of therapy, all patients presented hypertensive crises up to 200/95 mmHg. One of them was hospitalized, for an N-STEMI with hypertensive crisis. Lenvatinib was immediately suspended. Conclusions: Clinical trial results are not always reflected in clinical practice. In the case of lenvatinib, the simple monitoring of the PA is not sufficient at all. It is necessary to activate a much more stringent relationship between physician and patient and select candidate patients, possibly excluding those subjects with poor control of pressure.",,,,L633956645,10.1111/eci.13369

Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated in subjects with advanced HCC and baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥400 ng/mL treated with second-line ramucirumab. Patients and methods Patients with AFP≥400 ng/mL enrolled in the REACH or REACH-2 phase 3 studies were used in this analysis. Eligible patients had advanced HCC, Child-Pugh A, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1 and prior sorafenib. Patients received ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo once every 2 weeks. Disease-related symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Hepatobiliary Symptom Index (FHSI)-8 and EuroQoL-5-Dimensions (EQ-5D) instruments, respectively. Time to deterioration (TTD) (≥3-point decrease in FHSI-8 total score;≥0.06-point decrease in EQ-5D score, from randomisation to first date of deterioration) was determined using Kaplan-Meier estimation and the Cox proportional hazards model. Both separate and pooled analyses for REACH AFP≥400 ng/mL and REACH-2 patients were conducted. Results In the pooled population with AFP ≥400 ng/mL (n=542; ramucirumab, n=316; placebo, n=226), median TTD in FHSI-8 total score was prolonged with ramucirumab relative to placebo (3.3 vs 1.9 months; HR 0.725; (95% CI 0.559 to 0.941); p=0.0152), including significant differences in back pain (0.668; (0.497 to 0.899); p=0.0044), weight loss (0.699; (0.505 to 0.969); p=0.0231) and pain (0.769; (0.588 to 1.005); p=0.0248) symptoms. TTD in EQ-5D score was not significantly different between ramucirumab and placebo groups (median 2.9 vs 1.9 months). Results in the individual trials were consistent with these findings. Conclusions Ramucirumab in second-line treatment of advanced HCC demonstrates consistent benefit in the delay of deterioration in disease-related symptoms with no worsening of HRQoL. Taken with previously demonstrated ramucirumab-driven survival benefits in this setting, these data may inform patient-clinician discussions about the benefit-risk profile of this therapy.

REACH and REACH-2 were global phase III studies of ramucirumab in patients with HCC after prior sorafenib, where patients with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥400 ng/mL showed an overall ssurvival (OS) benefit for ramucirumab. These post-hoc analyses examined efficacy and safety of ramucirumab in patients with HCC and baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL by three prespecified age subgroups (<65, ≥65 to <75 and ≥75 years). Methods: Individual patient data were pooled from REACH (baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL) and REACH-2. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression methods (stratified by study) assessed OS, progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) and patient-reported outcomes (Functional Hepatobiliary System Index-8 [FHSI-8] score). Results: A total of 542 patients (<65 years: n = 302; ≥65 to <75 years: n = 160; ≥75 years: n = 80) showed similar baseline characteristics between ramucirumab and placebo. Older subgroups had higher hepatitis C and steatohepatitis incidences, and lower AFP levels, than the <65 years subgroup. Ramucirumab prolonged OS in patients <65 years (hazard ratio [HR], 0.753; 95% CI 0.581-0.975), ≥65 to <75 years (0.602; 0.419-0.866) and ≥75 years (0.709; 0.420-1.199), PFS and TTP irrespective of age. Ramucirumab showed similar overall safety profiles across subgroups, with a consistent median relative dose intensity ≥97.8%. A trend towards a delay in symptom deterioration in FHSI-8 with ramucirumab was observed in all subgroups. Conclusions: In this post-hoc analysis, ramucirumab showed a survival benefit across age subgroups with a tolerable safety profile, supporting its use in advanced HCC with elevated AFP, irrespective of age, including ≥75 years.",,,32279446,L2004850950,10.1111/liv.14462

Date of Publication: 1 Aug 2020","2020","183","2","231","241","1 Aug 2020","Background: Plaque psoriasis affects children and adults, but treatment options for paediatric psoriasis are limited. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ixekizumab (IXE), a high-affinity monoclonal antibody that selectively targets interleukin-17A, for moderate-to-severe paediatric psoriasis. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study (IXORA-PEDS), patients aged 6 to < 18 years with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis were randomized 2 : 1 to weight-based dosing of IXE every 4 weeks (IXE Q4W, n = 115) or placebo (n = 56) through week 12, followed by open-label IXE Q4W. Coprimary endpoints were the proportions of patients at week 12 achieving ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) and those achieving a static Physician's Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 (sPGA 0,1). Results: IXE was superior (P < 0·001) to placebo for both coprimary endpoints of PASI 75 (IXE Q4W, 89%; placebo, 25%) and sPGA (0,1) (IXE Q4W, 81%; placebo, 11%). IXE was also superior for all gated secondary endpoints, including PASI 75 and sPGA (0,1) at week 4, improvement in itch, and complete skin clearance. IXE Q4W provided significant (P < 0·001) improvements vs. placebo in quality of life and clearance of scalp and genital psoriasis. Responses at week 12 were sustained or further improved through week 48. Through week 12, 45% (placebo) and 56% (IXE) of patients reported treatment-emergent adverse events. One serious adverse event was reported (IXE), one patient discontinued due to an adverse event (placebo) and no deaths were reported. Conclusions: IXE was superior to placebo in the treatment of moderate-to-severe paediatric psoriasis, and the safety profile was generally consistent with that observed in adults. What is already known about this topic?. Paediatric psoriasis affects approximately 1% of children and can negatively impact health-related quality of life. Treatment options for paediatric psoriasis are typically limited to off-label treatments and approved systemic biologics. Ixekizumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody that selectively targets interleukin-17A, is approved for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults and was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for moderate-to-severe paediatric psoriasis. What does this study add?. Ixekizumab resulted in rapid and statistically significant improvements over placebo in skin involvement, itch and health-related quality of life, which persisted through 48 weeks of treatment in paediatric patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The safety profile of ixekizumab was generally consistent with that seen in adults. Ixekizumab may be an additional potential therapeutic option and an additional class of biologic therapy (interleukin-17A antagonist) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe paediatric psoriasis.

Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, patients with unresectable HCC treated with lenvatinib between 2018 and 2019 and had adequate clinical data were included. Objective response rate, progression-free-survival (PFS) and safety were evaluated according to meeting or not meeting the REFLECT eligibility criteria and according to the criteria of the REFLECT trial. Results: Of the 105 patients included, 61% (64 of 105) did not meet the REFLECT eligibility criteria. Safety and median PFS of lenvatinib were similar between the patients who did and those who did not meet the criteria. Among the patients who did not meet the criteria, 28, 27, 14, six, seven and five had a history of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, Child–Pugh score B, HCC in ≥50% of the liver, reduced platelet count, bile duct invasion and main portal vein invasion, respectively. The efficacy and safety of lenvatinib for patients with or without Child–Pugh-score B or HCC in ≥50% of the liver were similar. Although treatment outcome was not significantly different, patients with TKI treatment history tended to have longer median PFS, whereas those with main portal vein invasion tended to have shorter median PFS.

Increasing evidence suggests that NASH is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the second most common cause of cancer-related death. Recent studies support a strong mechanistic link between the NASH microenvironment and HCC development. The liver has a large capacity to remove circulating pathogens and gut-derived microbial compounds. Thus, the liver is a central player in immunoregulation. Altered immune responses are tightly associated with the development of NASH and HCC. The objective of this study was to differentiate the roles of specific immune cell subsets in NASH and HCC pathogenesis.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02442687, NCT02510599, NCT02576509, NCT02704403, NCT03028740, NCT03062358, NCT03298451)",,32770081,L2005794269,10.1038/s12276-020-0480-3

The role of external proton beam radiotherapy (PBT) is under investigation and a phase 2 study of PBT showed promising local control and safety. Herein, we conducted an investigator-initiated phase 3 non-inferiority trial to evaluate the effects of PBT on recurrent or residual HCC (rHCC). Method: Patients (pts) with rHCC (size <3 cm, number ≤2) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive PBT (Arm P) or RFA (Arm R) according to the Child-Pugh score and initial tumour stage. If the randomly assigned method was not technically feasible, pts were allowed to enroll in the other arm. Eligible pts of Arm P received a total of 66 Gray equivalent in 10 fractions and those of Arm R received RFA with a monopolar electrode. The primary endpoint was 2-year (y) local progression-free survival (LPFS) rate with a non-inferiority margin of 15%; secondary endpoints included overall survival, progression-free survival, tumour response rate and safety profile. (NCT01963429). Results: Between December 2013 and December 2017,144 pts in Arm P (n = 72) and Arm R (n = 72) comprised the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and the trial was concluded on January 2020. The baseline characteristics of pts were well balanced. In Arm P, six pts switched to Arm R and five pts received another treatment, while in Arm R,19 pts switched to Arm P and three pts received another treatment. Thus, the per-protocol (PP) population comprised 80 pts in Arm P and 56 pts in Arm R. In the ITT population, the 2-y LPFS rate with PBT vs. RFA was 92.8% vs. 83.2% (90% confidence interval [CI], 0.7–18.4%; p < 0.001), meeting criteria for non-inferiority. In the PP population, 2-y LPFS rate with PBT vs. RFA was 94.8% vs. 83.9% (90% CI, 1.8–20.0%; p < 0.001). The 3- and 4-y LPFS rate with PBT were also significantly non-inferior to those with RFA. Efficacy outcomes are shown in the figure. The most common any-grade adverse events (AEs) were radiation pneumonitis (32.5%), and decrease in leukocyte counts (23.8%) in Arm P; and increase in alanine aminotransferase level (96.4%), abdominal pain (30.4%) in Arm R.

The US FDA granted accelerated approval to pembrolizumab (PEMBRO), an antiprogrammed death receptor-1 monoclonal antibody, for patients (pts) with HCC after sorafenib therapy. We assessed the safety and efficacy of LEN + PEMBRO in the first 80 pts with uHCC enrolled in the 1L setting. Method: In this phase 1b trial (NCT03006926), pts received LEN 12 mg/day (bodyweight [BW] ≥60 kg) or 8 mg/day (BW >0 kg) orally + PEMBRO 200 mg intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability for Part 1, and objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) by modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (mRECIST), and RECIST version 1.1 per independent imaging review in the 1L setting for Part 2. Results: No dose-limiting toxicities were found in Part 1 (6 pts). At data cutoff (October 31, 2019), the first 80 pts enrolled in the 1L setting had a median follow-up of 11.5 months; the median duration of treatment was 8.5 months (LEN, 8.3 months; PEMBRO, 7.7 months), and 26 pts continued treatment (LEN only, n = 2; both drugs, n = 24).

Here, we report safety data from IMbrave150 (NCT03434379). Methods: In this open-label study, pts with systemic-tx naïve, unresectable HCC were randomised 2:1 to receive either atezo 1200 mg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (q3w) + bev 15 mg/kg IV q3w or sor 400 mg twice daily until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit per investigator. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed per CTCAE version 4.0. AEs of special interest (AESI) were sponsor-defined based on the immune-mediated risks of atezo and other drugs in its class. Results: In the safety population, 329 pts received atezo+bev and 156 received sor. Median tx duration was 7.4 mo for atezo, 6.9 mo for bev and 2.8 mo for sor (all ranges, 0–16 mo). Grade (Gr) 3–4 AEs occurred in 57% of pts receiving atezo+bev and 55% of pts receiving sor. Gr 5 AEs occurred in 5% and 6% of pts, respectively. AEs led to discontinuation of both atezo+bev in 7% of pts and of sor in 10% of pts. In both arms, most AESIs were Gr 1–2. Gr 3–4 atezo AESIs occurred in 26% and 30% of the atezo+bev and sor arms, respectively. More pts receiving atezo+bev (12%) required corticosteroid treatment than with sor (3%). The rate of immune-mediated hepatitis was comparable between the atezo+bev and sor arms (43% vs 40%, respectively). Conclusions: Atezo+bev was generally well-tolerated in pts with HCC, and potential immune-mediated AESIs, a toxicity concern with checkpoint inhibitors, were manageable. The safety profile was consistent with the known risks of the individual study tx and underlying disease. The positive efficacy and patient-reported outcomes from IMbrave150 and these safety findings suggest that atezo +bev should be considered a practice-changing tx for pts with unresectable HCC who have not received prior systemic tx.",,,,L2007844098,10.1016/S0168-8278(20)30759-5
"A lncRNA-associated ceRNA regulatory network in MVI positive hepatocellular carcinoma influences their sensitivity to sorafenib","Luo Z., Bi X.","Journal of Hepatology (2020) 73 Supplement 1 (S906). Date of Publication: 1 Aug 2020","2020","73",,"S906",,"1 Aug 2020","Background and Aims: Microvascular invasion (MVI) is a histological feature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) related to aggressiveness. But different sensitivity to first line targeted drug, sorafenib, in MVI(+) HCC has been observed. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can act as microRNA (miRNA) sponges to regulate protein-coding gene expression; so lncRNAs are considered as a major part of competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and have attracted growing attention. We explored the regulatory mechanisms and functional roles of lncRNAs as ceRNAs in MVI(+) HCC, and ceRNA network's potential impact on prognosis and sensitivity to sorafenib in MVI(+) HCC patient. Method: We studied the expression profiles, prognostic value of lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA from MVI(+) HCC patients, established a prognosis-related network of dysregulated ceRNAs and analyzed its role in sensitivity to sorafenib and radiomics features by bioinformatics methods. Results: A ceRNA network including 13 lncRNAs, 3 miRNAs, and 2 mRNAs specific to MVI+ HCC was established. 6 lncRNAs (ARHGEF7-AS1, ATP2B2-IT1, LINC00330, MUC2, TLR8-AS1 and ZNF385D-AS1), 2 miRNAs (has-mir-206 and has-mir-373) and two mRNAs (PAX3, SIK1) were prognostic biomarkers for MVI(+) HCC. PAX3 was an unfavorable prognostic gene (HR = 1.9, 95%CI 1.01 ∼ 3.60), while SIK1 favored the prognosis (HR = 0.4, 95%CI 0.19 ∼ 0.85). PAX3 as a stratification in recurrence predicting model was used to identify MVI(+) HCC with high or low recurrence risk. Datamining into the dataset of phase 3 STORM trial showed no difference in the influence of PAX3 level on the outcome between sorafenib HCC group and placebo HCC group. However, deep datamining into GDSC dataset revealed our high PAX3 group in MVI(+) HCC related to resistance to sorafenib (P = 0.0039). Radiomics features were extracted from CT of MVI(+) HCC, and texture analysis in MVI(+) HCCs is ongoing. Conclusion: The proposed ceRNA network may help elucidate the regulatory mechanism by which lncRNAs function as ceRNAs and contribute to the pathogenesis of MVI in HCC. Importantly, the candidate lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs involved in the ceRNA network have shown to be potential therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for MVI(+) HCC. PAX3 might play a vital role in the mechanism of sorafenib resistance in MVI(+) HCC, exclusively, this aggressive HCC subtype. The ongoing experiments on radiomics might add potent supports to identify sorafenib sensitive MVI(+) HCC. [Figure presented]",,,,L2007844581,10.1016/S0168-8278(20)32239-X

Date of Publication: 1 Aug 2020","2020","73",,"S562",,"1 Aug 2020","Background and Aims: Advanced liver disease (ALD) and liver cancer are a growing public health issue. Burdensome treatments for Hepatitis C once consumed nursing resources. However, as new treatments shift Hepatitis C care from specialist to generalist practice, hepatology nurses are freed to diversify their skills to meet the growing burden of ALD and liver cancer. There are limited examples internationally of hepatology education programs that address and assess core ADL nurse capability. Method: Phase 1 surveyed nurses’ attitudes towards ALD training and identified their learning needs. This informed curriculum and assessments comprising nine months of formal hepatologist mentoring, face to face and online learning, hands-on skill development and clinical placement. Phase 2 evaluated relevance of, and satisfaction with the curriculum, nurse/hepatologist experience of mentorship, and local issues impacting course participation. Phase 3 used a descriptive, qualitative method. Analysis of semi-structured interviews with nurses and hepatologists was guided by Fawcett's nursing metaparadigm and Schuler's model of advanced practice. Results: There was considerable demand for this program, which was rated as highly acceptable, feasible and relevant to ALD practice. Under mentorship, nurses developed education initiatives and local policies, and gave examples of nurse-led, patient-centred holistic models of advanced ALD practice. Participants revealed the person with ALD as socially disadvantaged, with substance use disorders and communication challenges. Their health embodied complex body needs. Their environment lacked ALD services, particularly in rural/regional settings, heightening stigma and discrimination. Emerging models of ALD nursing practice responded with listening to the whole story, being non-judgemental, being a lynch pin and building networks and lines of referral. Conclusion: The program was acceptable, feasible and effective in building capability for advanced nursing practice.

Date of Publication: 1 Aug 2020","2020","73",,"S693",,"1 Aug 2020","Background and Aims: V2-receptor antagonist named tolvaptan has not yet been added to the EASL guidelines. In Japan, a phase 3 clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan for cirrhotic patients with hepatic edema. Accordingly, in 2013, the use of tolvaptan for patients complicated by hepatic edema was approved. Contrary to the EASL guidelines, tolvaptan can be administered to patients resistant to treatment with conventional diuretics in Japan. We conducted a retrospective, multi-center collaborative study to identify the prognostic factors and clarify whether on-treatment factors, including conventional diuretic dosages and short-term response to tolvaptan, affect the long-term prognoses in cirrhotic patients with hepatic edema. Method:Patients were initially instructed to receive salt-restricted diet therapy and conventional diuretics. When the BW of the patients remained unchanged on treatment, tolvaptan was orally administered at a dosage of 7.5 mg/day. Short-term responders to tolvaptan were defined as patients with BW loss of ≥1.5 kg from baseline to day 7. Results: Patients consisted of 266 males and 141 females, with the median age of 68 years. The frequency of short-term responders to tolvaptan was 59.7%. In the Cox regression analysis, short-term response to tolvaptan, average dosages of furosemide and spironolactone during tolvaptan, Child-Pugh classification, and presence of hepatocellular carcinoma were independent factors associated with 1-year survival. The 1-year and long-term cumulative survival rates in short-term responders were significantly higher than those in non-responders (P = 0.011 and 0.010, respectively). Using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the optimal cut-off values of average daily dosages of furosemide and spironolactone for predicting 1-year survival were 19 mg/day and 23 mg/day, respectively. The long-term cumulative survival rates in patients who received a mean dosage of spironolactone <23 mg/day during tolvaptan treatment period were significantly higher than those receiving a mean dosage of ≥23 mg/day (P = 0.001). Conclusion: This study suggests that the short-term response to tolvaptan and low dosages of conventional diuretics during tolvaptan treatment improve the 1-year and long-term survival rates in cirrhotic patients with hepatic edema, irrespective of liver and kidney function and the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma.",,,,L2007845572,10.1016/S0168-8278(20)31847-X

We analyzed the real-world data to assess clinical efficacy and safety. Method: This study was a multicenter, non-comparative, retrospective cohort study. Between July 2017 and May 2019, 133 patients with HCC who received regorafenib after sorafenib therapy were eligible for inclusion in this study. Tumor response was assessed according to modified RECIST criteria. We evaluated time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of regorafenib therapy including prediction factors for prognosis. Results: Their median age was 60 years, and most patients (82%) were male. Hepatitis B virus infection (68.4%) was the most common etiology of HCC. Most of patients (98.5%) were classified as Child-Pugh A except 2. Eighty-four percent of patients had extrahepatic metastasis and Vascular invasion was presented in 45.1%. Three patients (2.7%) achieved complete response and 11 (9.8%) patients had a partial response resulting in objective response rate 12.5% in 112 available patients for response assessment. The disease control rate (DCR) was 34.8%. Median treatment duration of regorafenib was 2.6 months (1.5–4.7 months). During follow up, 38 patients died. On regorafenib, the median OS was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.4–11.6), the median PFS survival was 2.7 months (95% CI, 2.5–2.9 months), and the median TTP was 2.6 months (95% CI, 2.4–2.8).

However, this trial did not enroll patients with a history of systemic chemotherapy including sorafenib and regorafenib, bile duct invasion, and main portal vein invasion (Vp4). This real world multicenter study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib for these patients. Method: Patients who were administered lenvatinib for advanced HCC between April 2018 and July 2019 were enrolled. In principle, the treatment response and safety were evaluated via dynamic CT or MRI every 2 months until radiological disease progression. We evaluated treatment response in accordance with mRECIST. Further analysis by stratifying patients according to compliance and non-compliance with the REFLECT inclusion criteria was conducted. Results: A total of 105 patients were included. More than 60% (64/105) did not meet the REFLECT inclusion criteria. In total, 11 (10.5%), 42 (40.0%), 38 (36.2%), and 8 (7.6%) showed complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease, respectively.

REACH-2 limited enrolment to pts with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥ 400 ng/mL, and met its primary overall survival (OS) endpoint, consistent with the prespecified REACH subgroup with baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. Analysis of pooled individual pt data from REACH (AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL) and REACH-2 showed improved OS with RAM versus (vs) PL for pts with hepatitis B virus (HBV) aetiology (7.7 vs 4.5 months [mos]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55, 0.99). Here we investigate survival and liver function in REACH-2 pts with HBV aetiology tested for serum HBV DNA. Method: Pts had advanced HCC, Child-Pugh A, ECOG PS 0/1, AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL, prior sorafenib treatment, and were randomized (2:1) to receive RAM 8 mg/kg or PL Q2W. Pretreatment serum HBV DNA was quantified by HBV-specific PCR (Roche) by a central lab. HBV DNA >15 IU/mL was detectable (HBV DNA+), >5 IU/mL was undetectable (HBV DNA-). OS in pooled treatment arms was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. Liver function was assessed at baseline and before each cycle with the ALBI linear predictor. Outcomes were assessed by concomitant antiviral therapy. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by NCI-CTCAE v4.0. Results: Of 107 REACH-2 pts with HBV aetiology, 106 had available PCR samples and were included in a pooled analysis (70 RAM and 36 PL pts). 48 pts were HBV DNA+ and 58 pts were HBV DNA-. HBV DNA+ pts had poorer median OS vs HBV DNA- pts (5.3 vs 10.1 mos, unstratified HR 1.45, 95% CI 0.93, 2.28). HBV DNA+ pts taking concomitant antiviral therapy (n = 36) had numerically improved OS compared with those without (n = 12) (5.8 vs 4.0 mos). No difference in OS was noted for HBV DNA- pts by antiviral therapy use (n = 39 antiviral; n = 19 no antiviral) (10.2 vs 9.7 mos for yes vs no antiviral).

We performed a nationwide multicenter study of regorafenib therapy and investigated the factors associated with overall survival (OS). Method: A total of 81 u-HCC patients received regorafenib from Jun 2017 at 12 sites in Japan were registered. Tumour assessments in accordance with modified RECIST was done using dynamic CT or MRI within 4–8 weeks and every 6–8 weeks thereafter. Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the CTCAE ver4.0. Results: Median age and body weight were 70 years and 59 kg. The baseline liver function was Child-Pugh class A in 70 (86%) patients and 50 (62%) patients were BCLC stage C. Median overall survival (OS) and follow-up duration were 14.1 and 8.5 months. Median overall time under treatment was 3.1 months. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 4.2 months. Based on mRECIST, CR was shown in 0 (0%), PR in 8 (13%), SD in 34 (53%), and PD in 21 (33%) patients. Overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 13% and 67%. Fifteen patients started regorafenib at the standard initial dose (160 mg/day) and 66 patients started at reduced doses. There were no significant differences in median OS and PFS between the standard and reduced group. The patients who experienced hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) during regorafenib significantly showed better OS and PFS (<0.0001) than the patients without HFSR. The independent factors associated with OS in regorafenib therapy were pretreatment performance status (HR 3.5, 95%CI 1.42–8.64, p = 0.007), pretreatment Alb level (HR4.4, 95%CI 1.82–11.8, p = 0.001), Major portal invasion (HR 10.4, 95%CI 2.94–37.2, p = 0.0003), and HFSR during regorafenib (HR 0.13, 95%CI 0.05–0.33, p < 0.0001).

Mucocutaneous inflammation may cause HFS; therefore, we investigated whether celecoxib can alleviate HFS, improve patients' quality of life and increase survival when administered in conjunction with active therapy. Methods: Our randomized, open-label study prospectively enrolled 116 advanced HCC patients receiving sorafenibas targeted therapy from July 2015 to July 2016. All patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computer-generated sequence to receive sorafenib with or without celecoxib. Sorafenib-related AEs were recorded, Survival was compared between the two groups. Results: Compared to the Sorafenib group, the SoraCele group had lower incidence rates of ≥ grade 2 and grade 3HFS (63.8% vs 29.3%, P < 0.001; 19.0% vs 3.4%, P = 0.008, respectively), hair loss, rash and abdominal pain. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a lower risk of ≥ grade 2 HFS (HR, 0.384; P = 0.002) and a lower dosereduction/interruption rate (46.6% to 15.5%, P < 0.001) in the SoraCele group. Cox proportional hazards regressionanalysis demonstrated that celecoxib was the only independent predictive factor of developing ≥ grade 2 HFS (HR, 0.414; P = 0.004).

However, treatment options are limited for patients with advanced HCC other than CP-A. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of regorafenib on advanced HCC patients including those with Child-Pugh classification B (CP-B).We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 21 patients with advanced HCC who were treated with regorafenib after sorafenib monotherapy at our hospital from July 2017 to April 2018 and were followed up until September 2019. Patients were classified according to liver function and adverse events experienced during sorafenib treatment and were started on regorafenib with a pre-defined reduced starting dose along with a dose reduction and schedule change based on the judgement of the attending physician.At regorafenib initiation, 13 and 8 patients were classified as CP-A and CP-B, respectively. In all patients with CP-B, the starting dose of regorafenib was reduced, and the pre-defined starting-dose sets were applied to 17 (81%) patients. The median duration of regorafenib treatment in patients with CP-A and CP-B were 4.1 months and 2.0 months, respectively, with no significant difference. The median overall survival from regorafenib initiation (OS-r) and sorafenib initiation (OS-s) was 13.2 months and 30.9 months, respectively. In subgroup analysis, OS-r was 16.3 months in patients with CP-A and 10.1 months with CP-B with no significant difference (P = .44), whereas OS-r was 16.3 months in patients with modified albumin-bilirubin Grade 1/2a and 13.2 months in patients with Grade 2b, with no significant difference. There was no clear difference in the incidence rate of ≥grade 3 adverse events between CP-A and CP-B. OS-r and OS-s were significantly correlated.Even patients with impaired liver function achieved the desired therapeutic effects by safely reducing the starting dose of regorafenib according to both impaired liver function and adverse events during pretreatment.

We analyzed outcomes by baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and on-treatment AFP changes. Experimental design Serum AFP was measured every 8 weeks by blinded, centralized testing. Outcomes were analyzed by baseline AFP bifurcated at 400 ng/mL and by on-treatment AFP response (≥20% decrease from baseline at Week 8). The optimal cutoff for change in AFP at Week 8 was evaluated using maximally selected rank statistics. Results Median OS for cabozantinib versus placebo was 13.9 versus 10.3 months (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62-1.04) for patients with baseline AFP <400 ng/mL, and 8.5 versus 5.2 months (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.94) for patients with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL. Week 8 AFP response rate was 50% for cabozantinib versus 13% for placebo. In the cabozantinib arm, median OS for patients with and without AFP response was 16.1 versus 9.1 months (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.84). AFP response was independently associated with longer OS. The optimal cutoff for association with OS in the cabozantinib arm was ≤0% change in AFP at Week 8 (AFP control; HR 0.50 [95% CI, 0.35-0.71]). HRs for PFS were consistent with those for OS.

The most frequently employed chemotherapy regimen includes cisplatin and doxorubicin (PLADO), but this combination offers limited efficacy. Sorafenib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor which, following positive studies in adults with HCC, has begun to be introduced in conjunction with PLADO in pediatric oncology with some encouraging results. Based on these findings, the use of sorafenib is become more common in children with unresectable and/or metastatic HCC. The care of patients receiving sorafenib requires appropriate expertise and standardized pediatric guidelines are lacking. An increasing number of children with HCC are expected to receive sorafenib in the years to come. Pediatric oncology clinicians have a key role in identifying side effects early and clinicians caring for children receiving sorafenib need to be familiar with these. This review article provides suitable and practical information on sorafenib for educational development to optimize clinical care and facilitate enhanced patient/parent education. The article addresses specific areas including mechanisms of action, pre-clinical and clinical evidence, dosing and drug administration and toxicities of sorafenib.

Satisfactory treatment efficacy and tolerability can be provided by novel DAAs. Nevertheless, there are still some unmet needs and emerging issues in the treatment of CHC in the DAA era. Certain hard-to-cure populations are prone to have inferior treatment responses, including patients with severe liver decompensation, active hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 (HCV-3) infection and those who experience multiple DAA treatment failures. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation during and after DAA treatment has raised concern regarding the use of prophylactic antivirals against HBV throughout DAA treatment. However, the standard strategy for the use of prophylactic antivirals is not uniform across regional guidelines. In the post-sustained virological response (SVR) period, HCC still occurs in a substantial proportion of patients. Due to the relatively short follow-up period, the net benefit of the achievement of an SVR by DAAs in the reduction of extrahepatic manifestations has not yet been determined. Attention must also be paid to HCV reinfection, particularly in high-risk populations. The most critical and unmet need for HCV elimination is the large gap in the HCV care cascade at the population level. To accomplish the World Health Organization (WHO)’s goal for HCV elimination by 2030, the expansion of access to HCV care requires a continuous effort to overcome practical and political challenges.

We evaluated the safety and antifibrotic effect of selonsertib, a selective inhibitor of ASK1, in patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH. Methods: We conducted 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trials of selonsertib in patients with NASH and bridging fibrosis (F3, STELLAR-3) or compensated cirrhosis (F4, STELLAR-4). Patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive selonsertib 18 mg, selonsertib 6 mg, or placebo once daily for 48 weeks. Liver biopsies were performed at screening and week 48 and non-invasive tests of fibrosis (NITs) were evaluated. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with ≥1-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH at week 48. Additional endpoints included changes in NITs, progression to cirrhosis (in STELLAR-3), and liver-related clinical events. Results: Neither trial met the primary efficacy endpoint. In STELLAR-3, fibrosis improvement without worsening of NASH was observed in 10% (31/322, p = 0.49 vs. placebo), 12% (39/321, p = 0.93 vs. placebo), and 13% (21/159) of patients in the selonsertib 18 mg, selonsertib 6 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In STELLAR-4, the primary endpoint was achieved in 14% (51/354; p = 0.56), 13% (45/351; p = 0.93), and 13% (22/172) of patients, respectively. Although selonsertib led to dose-dependent reductions in hepatic phospho-p38 expression indicative of pharmacodynamic activity, it had no significant effect on liver biochemistry, NITs, progression to cirrhosis, or adjudicated clinical events. The rates and types of adverse events were similar among selonsertib and placebo groups. Conclusions: Forty-eight weeks of selonsertib monotherapy had no antifibrotic effect in patients with bridging fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis due to NASH. Lay summary: Patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can develop scarring of the liver (fibrosis), including cirrhosis, which increases the risks of liver failure and liver cancer. We tested whether 48 weeks of treatment with selonsertib reduced fibrosis in patients with NASH and advanced liver scarring. We did not find that selonsertib reduced fibrosis in these patients.

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2020","2020","325",,,,"1 Jul 2020","The prenylated flavonoid icaritin (ICT) is currently undergoing phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), based on a solid array of preclinical and clinical data. The antitumor activity originates from the capacity of the drug to modulate several signaling effectors in cancer cells, mainly the estrogen receptor splice variant ERα36, the transcription factors STAT3 and NFκB, and the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Recent studies have implicated additional components, including different microRNAs, the generation of reactive oxygen species and the targeting of sphingosine kinase-1. ICT also engages the RAGE-HMGB1 signaling route and modulates the apoptosis/autophagy crosstalk to promote its anticancer activity. In addition, ICT exerts profound changes on the tumor microenvironment to favor an immune-response. Collectively, these multiple biochemical and cellular characteristics confer to ICT a robust activity profile which can be exploited to treat HCC, as well as other cancers, including glioblastoma and onco-hematological diseases such as chronic myeloid leukemia. This review provides an update of the pharmacological properties of ICT and its metabolic characteristics. It also addresses the design of derivatives, including both natural products and synthetic molecules, such as SNG1153 also in clinical trial.

Locoregional therapies are able to downstage hepatocellular carcinoma from beyond to within the Milan criteria. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of liver transplantation after successful hepatocellular carcinoma downstaging. Methods: We did an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial designed in two phases, 2b and 3, at nine Italian tertiary care and transplantation centres. Patients aged 18–65 years with hepatocellular carcinoma beyond the Milan criteria, absence of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread, 5-year estimated post-transplantation survival of at least 50%, and good liver function (Child-Pugh A-B7) were recruited and underwent tumour downstaging with locoregional, surgical, or systemic therapies according to multidisciplinary decision. After an observation period of 3 months, during which sorafenib was allowed, patients with partial or complete responses according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive web-response system to liver transplantation or non-transplantation therapies (control group). A block randomisation (block size of 2), stratified by centre and compliance to sorafenib treatment, was applied. Liver transplantation was done with whole or split organs procured from brain-dead donors. The control group received sequences of locoregional and systemic treatment at the time of demonstrated tumour progression. The primary outcomes were 5-year tumour event-free survival for phase 2b and overall survival for phase 3. Analyses were by intention to treat. Organ allocation policy changed during the course of the study and restricted patient accrual to 4 years. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01387503. Findings: Between March 1, 2011, and March 31, 2015, 74 patients were enrolled. Median duration of downstaging was 6 months (IQR 4–11). 29 patients dropped out before randomisation and 45 were randomly assigned: 23 to the transplantation group versus 22 to the control group. At data cutoff on July 31, 2019, median follow-up was 71 months (IQR 60–85). 5-year tumour event-free survival was 76·8% (95% CI 60·8–96·9) in the transplantation group versus 18·3% (7·1–47·0) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·20, 95% CI 0·07–0·57; p=0·003). 5-year overall survival was 77·5% (95% CI 61·9–97·1) in the transplantation group versus 31·2% (16·6–58·5) in the control group (HR 0·32, 95% CI 0·11–0·92; p=0·035). The most common registered grade 3–4 serious adverse events were hepatitis C virus recurrence (three [13%] of 23 patients) and acute transplant rejection (two [9%]) in the transplantation group, and post-embolisation syndrome (two [9%] of 22 patients) in the control group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in four patients: two (8%) of 23 patients in the transplantation group (myocardial infarction and multi-organ failure) versus two (9%) of 22 patients in the control group (liver decompensation). Interpretation: Although results must be interpreted with caution owing to the early closing of the trial, after effective and sustained downstaging of eligible hepatocellular carcinomas beyond the Milan criteria, liver transplantation improved tumour event-free survival and overall survival compared with non-transplantation therapies Post-downstaging tumour response could contribute to the expansion of hepatocellular carcinoma transplantation criteria.

In the phase III IMbrave150 trial, atezolizumab + bevacizumab was associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in overall survival (OS; HR, 0.58; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.79) and progression-free survival (PFS; HR, 0.59; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.76) as well as clinically meaningful delays in deterioration of patient-reported functioning and quality of life (QoL) vs sorafenib in patients with unresectable HCC who had not received prior systemic therapy (Cheng, ESMO Asia, 2019). Here, we report exploratory subgroup analyses of the efficacy, safety and patient-reported outcome (PRO) results for older adults enrolled in IMbrave150. Methods: IMbrave150 randomized 501 systemic treatment (tx)–naïve patients with unresectable HCC. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either atezolizumab 1200 mg IV q3w + bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV q3w or sorafenib 400 mg BID until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit per investigator. Co-primary endpoints were OS and PFS by independent review facility (IRF)-assessed RECIST 1.1. Objective response rate (ORR) per IRF-RECIST 1.1 and time to deterioration (TTD) in patient-reported physical functioning, role functioning and QoL per the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire were pre-specified secondary endpoints. The exploratory older adult subgroup was defined to include those aged ≥ 65 years. Results: In IMbrave150, 161 (48%) patients enrolled in the atezolizumab + bevacizumab arm and 91 (55%) in the sorafenib arm were aged ≥ 65 years. In these patients, the median OS was not reached with atezolizumab + bevacizumab vs 14.9 months with sorafenib (HR, 0.58; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.92). The median PFS was 7.7 months with atezolizumab + bevacizumab vs 4.8 months with sorafenib (HR, 0.63; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.89). ORRs were 26% with atezolizumab + bevacizumab vs 13% with sorafenib, with 7 and 0 patients achieving complete responses, respectively. TTD in physical functioning (HR, 0.48; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.73), role functioning (HR, 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.91) and QoL (HR, 0.71; 95% CI: 0.47, 1.07) were longer for patients receiving atezolizumab + bevacizumab vs sorafenib. In the atezolizumab + bevacizumab arm, 62 of 158 (39%) treated patients aged ≥ 65 years experienced a grade 3-4 treatment-related AE (TRAE) and 4 (3%) patients experienced a grade 5 TRAE, whereas 55 of 171 (32%) treated patients aged < 65 years experienced a grade 3-4 TRAE and 1 (1%) patient experienced a grade 5 TRAE. Exploratory analyses were also conducted with the subgroup of patients aged ≥ 70 years, showing similar results for efficacy, safety and PROs. Conclusion: Similar to the IMbrave150 ITT population, older adults with previously untreated, unresectable HCC derived a clinically meaningful benefit from atezolizumab + bevacizumab vs sorafenib. Additionally, treatment with atezolizumab + bevacizumab showed a delay in deterioration in patient-reported functioning and QoL vs sorafenib. Safety of atezolizumab + bevacizumab in adults ≥ 65 years old is generally consistent with the safety in younger patients, with no added risks or toxicities.

ASCO 2017) and combined with TACE (Duffy, et al. J Hepatology, 2017). CIs combined with VEGF inhibitors (Cheng, et al. ESMO Asia 2019) also show promise in advanced HCC. Taken together, combining D, VEGF inhibitors, and TACE therapies warrants evaluation in patients with locoregional HCC. EMERALD-1 (NCT03778957) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase 3 study assessing efficacy and safety for durvalumab monotherapy when given with either drug-eluting bead (DEB)-TACE or conventional TACE (cTACE) followed by durvalumab with or without bevacizumab therapy in patients with HCC not amenable to curative therapy. Trial design: 600 patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to Arm A (DEB-TACE or cTACE + durvalumab and following last TACE procedure, durvalumab + placebo), Arm B (DEB-TACE or cTACE + durvalumab followed by durvalumab + bevacizumab), or Arm C (DEB-TACE or cTACE). Durvalumab therapy will begin after at least 7 days following the initial TACE procedure. Durvalumab ± bevacizumab will begin after at least 14 days following the last TACE procedure. Eligible patients must have confirmed HCC not amenable to curative therapy, have Child-Pugh score class A to B7, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients with a history of nephrotic or nephritic syndrome, clinically significant cardiovascular disease, extrahepatic disease, or main portal vein thrombosis (Vp3/Vp4) are excluded. Patients with active (controlled) or past hepatitis virus B or C infection may be enrolled. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) for Arm A versus Arm C by blinded independent radiology review using RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints include PFS for Arm B versus Arm C, overall survival, health-related quality of life measures, and safety.

The current standard of care for patients with intermediate disease who are ineligible for curative treatment is locoregional therapy with chemoembolization (TACE). Lenvatinib is a potent inhibitor of VEGFRs 1-3, FGFRs 1-4, PDGFR α, RET, and KIT, and is recommended as an option for the first-line treatment of advanced HCC. Pembrolizumab is a PD-1 inhibitor currently recommended as a second-line option for advanced HCC. Data from a phase 1b trial of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab demonstrated that the combination has promising antitumor activity and manageable safety in patients with unresectable, intermediate-stage HCC not amenable to TACE. LEAP-012 (NCT04246177) is a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial investigating lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab vs placebo in combination with TACE in patients with intermediate HCC. Trial design: Eligible patients are ≥18 years old with a confirmed diagnosis of HCC localized to the liver without portal vein thrombosis and not amenable to curative treatment. Patients must have ≥1 lesion measurable per RECIST v1.1 confirmed by blinded independent central review (BICR), an ECOG performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, and adequate organ function. Patients who have previously received locoregional therapy (within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment) or systemic chemotherapy for HCC, or prior therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 or CTLA-4 agent, and those with extrahepatic disease will be excluded. Approximately 950 patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to oral lenvatinib 12 mg (body weight [BW] ≥60 kg) or 8 mg (BW 400 ng/mL), ECOG PS (0 vs 1), albumin-bilirubin grade (1 vs 2 or 3), and tumor burden (utilizing the 6 and 12 rule; ≤6 vs >6 but ≤12 vs >12). Imaging (CT/MRI) will be performed every 9 weeks, or more frequently if indicated. Safety will be assessed throughout the study and up to 90 days after the end of treatment. Patients will be followed for survival every 12 weeks after progression or initiation of a new anticancer therapy. Co-primary endpoints are overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 by BICR. Secondary endpoints are PFS, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), and time to progression (TTP) per modified RECIST by BICR; ORR, DCR, DOR, and TTP per RECIST v1.1 by BICR; and safety. Exploratory endpoints are PFS, ORR, DCR, DOR, TTP and time from randomization to second/subsequent progression (PFS2) per RECIST v1.1 by investigator review; identification of molecular biomarkers; and health-related quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-HCC18, and EQ-5D-5L).

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2020","2020","31",,"S220",,"1 Jul 2020","Background: Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Child-Pugh B liver cirrhosis have poor prognosis, limited treatment options, and are underrepresented in clinical trials. In the CELESTIAL trial (NCT01908426), cabozantinib improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo in previously treated patients with advanced HCC. Like other phase 3 trials in advanced HCC, CELESTIAL limited eligibility to patients with Child-Pugh A liver function. We retrospectively analyzed data from patients in CELESTIAL whose cirrhosis evolved to Child-Pugh B by Week 8, the time of the first Child-Pugh assessment post-randomization. Methods: Overall, 707 patients were randomized 2:1 to cabozantinib (60 mg QD) or placebo. Eligible patients were ECOG PS ≤1 and Child-Pugh A, had received prior sorafenib, and had received ≤2 prior systemic regimens for advanced HCC. Outcomes were analyzed from randomization for the subgroup of patients who were Child-Pugh B in the study by Week 8. Results: At Week 8, 51 patients in the cabozantinib arm and 22 patients in the placebo arm had Child-Pugh B cirrhosis. At baseline in this subgroup, patients in the cabozantinib arm versus the placebo arm had higher rates of macrovascular invasion (43% vs 32%), extrahepatic spread (82% vs 68%), elevated alpha-fetoprotein (39% vs 27% with ≥400 ng/mL), HBV (35% vs 27%), and HCV (31% vs 18%). Further, baseline ALBI grade 1/2/3 rates were 10%, 88%, and 2%, respectively, in the cabozantinib arm versus 5%, 95%, and 0% in the placebo arm. For this Child-Pugh B subgroup, median OS from randomization was 8.5 months with cabozantinib versus 3.8 months with placebo (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18–0.58), and median PFS was 3.7 versus 1.9 months (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.25–0.76). Tolerability of cabozantinib in this subgroup was similar to the overall study population, although rates of specific adverse events (AEs) differed between the 2 groups. For cabozantinib-treated patients, median duration of exposure was 3.7 months (range 1.4–12.9) for the Child-Pugh B subgroup versus 3.8 months (range 0.1–37.3) for the overall population; and the median average daily dose was 36.9 mg versus 35.8 mg. Sixty-one percent of cabozantinib-treated patients in the Child-Pugh B subgroup had dose reductions versus 62% in the overall population, while the rate of discontinuation due to treatment-related AEs was 18% versus 16%, and the rate of all-causality grade 3/4 AEs was 71% versus 68%. The most common all-causality grade 3/4 AEs with cabozantinib in the Child-Pugh B subgroup were fatigue (20% in the Child-Pugh B subgroup vs 10% in the overall population), ascites (14% vs 4%), aspartate aminotransferase increase (14% vs 12%), and thrombocytopenia (12% vs 3%); however, rates of grade 3/4 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (8% vs 17%) and hypertension (8% vs 16%) were lower than in the overall population. Conclusion: This retrospective analysis showed cabozantinib may have a manageable safety profile along with evidence of clinical efficacy in patients with advanced HCC who had deterioration of liver function to Child-Pugh B in the study by Week 8.

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2020","2020","31",,"S177",,"1 Jul 2020","Background: Hepatocarcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent primary liver neoplasm. In most cases, the diagnosis of HCC occurs in a context of non-operability or metastatic disease for which systemic treatment is indicated. In Italy, two drugs are indicated and reimbursed as first-line setting for HCC: sorafenib and lenvatinib. Lenvatinib is a small multitarget molecule that selectively inhibits kinase activities of pathway-related proangiogenic and oncogenic receptors. The efficacy of lenvatinib has been demonstrated in the randomized phase III REFLECT clinical trial. The study demonstrated the non-inferiority of lenvatinib compared to sorafenib, in patients with preserved liver function, in terms of overall survival (OS), the primary endpoint of the study. Moreover, lenvatinib showed an advantage in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and the objective response rate (ORR). The toxicity profiles and data for quality of life (QoL) were similar for both drugs. Furthermore, there is an unmet need for predictive biomarkers of toxicity and efficacy/resistance for multitarget kinases drugs. Howewer, some studies suggest the possibility of using the cavitation of lung metastases as a radiological marker of response to cancer therapy especially when the treatment has antiangiogenic properties. Trial design: The proposed study is a monocentric observational trial that involves data collection about possible associated factors for the effectiveness of the treatment and side effects associated with lenvatinib. Moreover, the study plans the administration of QoL questionnaires and the acquisition of images relating to CT scan re-evaluations. We will use the EORTC QLQ-C30 V.3 questionnaire and the NCI-PROCTCAE ITEMS-ITALIAN V1.0 questionnaire, which will be administered at baseline, after 8-12 weeks after the start of treatment in concomitant with the CT-scan re-evaluation and at the end of the first-line treatment. The images of the instrumental re-evaluations performed with CT scan will be acquired at baseline, at the first reassessment and at the end of the treatment. The cavitation of the pulmonary metastases will be analyzed by an expert radiologist at the center who will not be made aware of individual patients' PFS and OS responses. Cavitation will be evaluated according to criteria drawn up in the RadioCORRECT study: - at baseline, the cavitation of lung metastases as defined as the presence of a cavity full of air occupying ≥10% of the maximum diameter of one or more lung metastases with a maximum diameter ≥10 mm; - on re-evaluation after an interval of 8-12 weeks, cavitation of lung metastases is defined as the appearance of full cavities of air in lung metastases or as an increase in cavitations existing.

However, data on the safety and efficacy of lenvatinib for patients with unresectable HCC who did not met the REFLECT inclusion criteria are limited. In the REFLECT trial, patients were excluded if they had history of multikinase inhibitor treatment, had HCC involving ≥50% of the liver, main portal vein invasion, Child-Pugh grade B, platelet count 9 /l, or obvious bile duct invasion; thus, the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib for such patients have not been clarified. Hence, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the tolerability, objective response rate (ORR), and PFS of lenvatinib for patients with unresectable HCC, specifically those who did not meet the REFLECT inclusion criteria. Methods: In this multicenter, retrospective study, patients with unresectable HCC treated with lenvatinib between 2018 and 2019 who had adequate clinical data were included. Objective response rate, progression-free survival, and safety were evaluated according to meeting or not meeting the REFLECT inclusion criteria and according to the exclusion criteria of the REFLECT trial. Results: Of the 105 patients included, 61% (64/105) did not meet the REFLECT inclusion criteria. Safety, ORR, and median PFS of lenvatinib were similar between the patients who did and those who did not meet the criteria. Among the patients who did not meet the criteria, 28, 27, 14, 6, 7, and 5 had a history of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, Child-Pugh score B, HCC in ≥50% of the liver, reduced platelet count, bile duct invasion, and main portal vein invasion, respectively. Although treatment outcome was not significantly different, patients with TKI treatment history and bile duct invasion tended to have longer median PFS and/or favorable ORR, whereas those with reduced platelet count and main portal vein invasion tended to have shorter median PFS. Conclusion: Lenvatinib was effective for patients who did not meet the REFLECT inclusion criteria. However, the treatment outcome may vary according to several factors, such as history of TKI treatment, tumor invasion, and platelet count.

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2020","2020","31",,"S96","S97","1 Jul 2020","Background: While percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is considered the standard local ablative modality for the treatment of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) is being increasingly used in recent years and, although several authors compared the two ablative modalities, it remains unclear which technique results in better clinical outcomes. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare percutaneous MWA versus percutaneous RFA in BCLC-A HCC in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), especially focusing on five outcomes of interest in this specific patient subpopulation. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines to evaluate the clinical role of MWA and RFA in BCLC-A HCC in terms of complete ablation (CA) rate, local recurrence (LR) rate, overall survival (OS) rate at 1 year, OS rate at 3 years and major complications rate. All phase II and phase III RCTs published from June 15, 2008, to February 6, 2020, comparing MWA and RFA in BCLC-A HCC were retrieved through PubMed/Med, Cochrane library and EMBASE. Five eligible studies involving a total of 794 patients (MWA: 409; RFA: 385) and 1008 nodules of HCC (MWA: 519; RFA: 489) were included in our analysis. Results about CA, LR, OS and major complications rate were compared by calculating Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs); ORs were combined with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Statistical heterogeneity between studies was examined using the Chi-square test and the I2 statistic; substantial heterogeneity was considered to exist when the I2 value was greater than 50% or there was a low P-value (< 0.10) in the Chi-square test. The risk of bias in the five selected studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias, including selection, performance, detection, attrition and reporting bias. Results: No differences in CA rate (OR=1.21; 95% CI 0.52-2.80, I2 5%), LR rate (OR=0.78; 95% CI 0.36-1.69, I2 60%), OS at 3 years (OR=1.17; 95% CI 0.81-1.70, I2 0%) and major complications rate (OR=1.11; 95% CI 0.55-2.23, I2 32%) between percutaneous MWA and percutaneous RFA were detected in the analysis. Regarding OS at 1 year, a higher rate was observed for the MWA group (OR=1.9; 95% CI 1.03-3.51, I2 32%). All studies included in our analysis were judged as studies with a low risk of bias in separate reviews of 4 authors. Conclusion: The comparison between MWA and RFA is currently under debate, with several meta-analyses finding similar efficacy and safety between the two modalities. However, previous studies presented several limitations, given the inclusion of primary and secondary liver malignancies and HCC at different stages; moreover, most of the experience comparing the two modalities comes from retrospective analyses of single-center cohorts, with no level 1 data supporting the superiority of RFA or MWA. In our study, MWA resulted in better survival at 1 year, although this benefit was not confirmed in the 3-year analysis. Well-designed, multicenter RCTs with large sample sizes are further required to confirm the above results.

Post-hoc review revealed imbalances in prognostic variables between treatment arms. Here, we re-analyse overall survival data from REFLECT to adjust for the imbalance in covariates. Methods: Univariable and multivariable adjustments were undertaken for a candidate set of covariate values that a physician panel indicated could be prognostically associated with overall survival in uHCC. The values included baseline variables observed pre- and post-randomisation. Univariable analyses were based on a stratified Cox model. The multivariable analysis used a “forwards stepwise” Cox model. Results: Univariable analysis identified alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as the most influential variable. The chosen multivariable Cox model analysis resulted in an estimated adjusted hazard ratio for lenvatinib of 0.814 (95% CI: 0.699–0.948) when only baseline variables were included. Adjusting for post-randomisation treatment variables further increased the estimated superiority of lenvatinib. Conclusions: Covariate adjustment of REFLECT suggests that the original noninferiority trial likely underestimated the true effect of lenvatinib on overall survival due to an imbalance in baseline prognostic covariates and the greater use of post-treatment therapies in the sorafenib arm.

The prognosis remains poor—the 5‑year overall-survival (OS) is 12–18%, all stages taken together. Systemic therapy has been limited to the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for more than a decade. Now immune therapy has also arrived in the field of systemic HCC treatment. Despite initial enthusiasm, the response rate to single agent immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in HCC patients is approximately 15–20%.

These thermal ablation techniques have the particularity to induce immunomodulation by destroying tumours, although this is not sufficient to raise an effective antitumour immune response. Ablative therapies combined with immunotherapies could act synergistically to enhance antitumour immunity.

In this context, the dysregulation of immuno-metabolism plays a leading role both in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and at the host level. In this review, we summarize the most important immune-metabolic factors and how they could be exploited therapeutically. At the cellular level, an increased concentration of extracellular adenosine as well as the depletion of tryptophan and uncontrolled activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway induces an immune-tolerant TME, reducing the response to ICIs. Moreover, aberrant angiogenesis induces a hypoxic environment by recruiting VEGF, T(reg) cells and immune-suppressive tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). On the other hand, factors such as gender and body mass index seem to affect the response to ICIs, while the microbiome composition (and its alterations) modulates both the response and the development of immune-related adverse events. Exploiting these complex mechanisms is the next goal in immunotherapy. The most successful strategy to date has been the combination of antiangiogenic drugs and ICIs, which prolonged the survival of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while results from tryptophan pathway inhibition studies are inconclusive. New exciting strategies include targeting the adenosine pathway, TAMs and the microbiota with fecal microbiome transplantation.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00790010, NCT01633970, NCT01984242, NCT02039674, NCT02366143, NCT02420821, NCT02953509, NCT03006302, NCT03131908, NCT03161431, NCT03175432, NCT03177187, NCT03190174, NCT03196232, NCT03353831, NCT03381274, NCT03395899, NCT03434379, NCT03596281, NCT03616886, NCT03661320, NCT03737643, NCT03772561, NCT03773666, NCT03778957, NCT03806049, NCT03822351, NCT03823131, NCT03832673, NCT03838367, NCT03847428, NCT03854032, NCT03869190, NCT03884556, NCT03927105, NCT03957096, NCT04068610, NCT04089553, NCT04091217, NCT04106414, NCT04177108, NCT04193293, NCT04231864, NCT04242238, NCT04261075, NCT04262375, NCT04301778, NCT04317105)",,32575899,L2004586638,10.3390/ijms21124414

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) alone and combined with bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: GO30140 is an open-label, multicentre, multiarm, phase 1b study that enrolled patients at 26 academic centres and community oncology practices in seven countries worldwide. The study included five cohorts, and the two hepatocellular carcinoma cohorts, groups A and F, are described here. Inclusion criteria for these two groups included age 18 years and older; histologically, cytologically, or clinically (per American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases criteria) confirmed unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma that was not amenable to curative treatment; no previous systemic treatment; and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. In group A, all patients received atezolizumab (1200 mg) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) intravenously every 3 weeks. In group F, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous atezolizumab (1200 mg) plus intravenous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks or atezolizumab alone by interactive voice-web response system using permuted block randomisation (block size of two) and stratification factors of geographical region; macrovascular invasion, extrahepatic spread, or both; and baseline α-fetoprotein concentration. Primary endpoints were confirmed objective response rate in all patients who received the combination treatment for group A and progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population in group F, both assessed by an independent review facility according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. In both groups, safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of any study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02715531, and is closed to enrolment. Findings: In group A, 104 patients were enrolled between July 20, 2016, and July 31, 2018, and received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. With a median follow-up of 12·4 months (IQR 8·0–16·2), 37 (36%; 95% CI 26–46) of 104 patients had a confirmed objective response. The most common grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events were hypertension (13 [13%]) and proteinuria (seven [7%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 25 (24%) patients and treatment-related deaths in three (3%) patients (abnormal hepatic function, hepatic cirrhosis, and pneumonitis). In group F, 119 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned (60 to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab; 59 to atezolizumab monotherapy) between May 18, 2018, and March 7, 2019. With a median follow-up of 6·6 months (IQR 5·5–8·5) for the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 6·7 months (4·2–8·2) for the atezolizumab monotherapy group, median progression-free survival was 5·6 months (95% CI 3·6–7·4) versus 3·4 months (1·9–5·2; hazard ratio 0·55; 80% CI 0·40–0·74; p=0·011). The most common grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events in group F were hypertension (in three [5%] patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group; none in the atezolizumab monotherapy group) and proteinuria (in two [3%] patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group; none in the atezolizumab monotherapy group). Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in seven (12%) patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and two (3%) patients in the atezolizumab monotherapy group. There were no treatment-related deaths. Interpretation: Our study shows longer progression-free survival with a combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab than with atezolizumab alone in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma not previously treated with systemic therapy. Therefore, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab might become a promising treatment option for these patients. This combination is being compared with standard-of-care sorafenib in a phase 3 trial.

Unlike other types of cancer, the number of patients in Japan is epidemiologically showing an upward trend, and 70% of cases are unresectable at diagnosis. Therefore, development of chemotherapy that improves the prognosis and maintains and improves the quality of life of the patient is a critical issue. Against this backdrop, the efficacy of nanoliposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) in combination with fluorouracil and folinic acid (FF) for progressive metastatic pancreatic cancer after previous gemcitabine therapy was confirmed in Europe in 2015 ahead of Japan. In NAPOLI-1, an overseas phase ID study of this therapy, a signifi-cant improvement in overall survival was shown as compared with patients who received FF alone (median: 6.1 months for nal-IRI plus FF vs 4.2 months for FF alone, p=0.012). Therefore, this study yielded important evidence for second-line treatment of pancreatic cancer around the world. In Japan, a phase n study was conducted to confirm the efficacy and safety of this therapy, which found a significant prolongation of progression-free survival (as assessed by the investigator) with this therapy as compared with FF alone (median: 2.7 months for nal-IRI plus FF vs 1.5 months for FF alone, p=0.039).

The gut-specific nature of the anti-integrin agent vedolizumab (VZB) holds promise of achieving and maintaining remission in IBD without increasing the risk of severe infection or malignancy. However, providers are more likely to prescribe lower potency medications such as mesalamine for older patients, in efforts to minimize harm from biologics. Patients over 65 years are often excluded from clinical trials or are not adequately represented. For example, in phase 3 VZB trials, only 46 patients were over age 65. This study investigates the safety of VZB in veterans with IBD over age 65. Methods This is a single-center retrospective cohort study that evaluated patients who received VZB at the VA Loma Linda Healthcare System. Patients were identified using the computerized patient record system. Patients who received VZB at 65 years or older were included. We then investigated adverse effects after starting VZB, including but not limited to hospitalization, infections, septic complication, antibiotic use, infusion reaction, and malignancy. Results Seventeen patients were identified. The median age was 71 (range 66-82). Patient and IBD characteristics are outlined in Table 1. The median duration of VZB therapy was 29 months (range 1-39). No patients discontinued VZB due to adverse effects. None had septic complications or ICU admissions. Three patients were hospitalized for diverticulitis, renal cell carcinoma therapy, and following a motor vehicle accident. Two patients developed Clostridium difficile infections [CDI], one bronchitis, and another diverticulitis. One CDI recurred, resulting in withholding 1 dose of VZB and was treated with fecal microbiota transplant. All other infections resolved with standard antibiotic use without VZB interruption. Two patients, one of which had thiopurine exposure, developed skin squamous cell carcinomas 2 months and 3 years after stopping VZB. One patient with chronic urticaria developed a rash while receiving VZB but tolerated therapy without interruption. One death was observed due to hepatocellular carcinoma. Other outcomes are outlined in Table 2. Conclusions In this cohort of veteran patients over age 65 receiving VZB, we did not observe an increased incidence of severe infection, malignancy or other adverse effects up to 39 months of therapy. The adverse effects observed are not expected to be more frequent than in the general IBD or geriatric population. This cohort provides the first real-world safety data on VZB usage in older patients. Although larger studies are needed, VZB appears to be safe and should not be withheld in the management of IBD in older patients.",,,,L2005912676,10.1016/S0016-5085(20)32391-X

Date of Publication: 1 May 2020","2020","158","6","S-194",,"1 May 2020","Background: Vedolizumab (VDZ) is a gut-selective, humanized, monoclonal α(4)β(7) integrin antibody treatment for active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD). VDZ is currently available as an intravenous (IV) formulation; a new subcutaneous (SC) formulation offering an alternative route of administration during maintenance therapy has been developed in a phase 3 program. The recent results from VISIBLE 1 showed the efficacy and safety of VDZ SC in UC. Here, we present results from the VISIBLE 2 study of VDZ SC in CD. Methods: VISIBLE 2 (NCT02611817; EudraCT 2015-000481-58) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled phase 3 trial of VDZ SC as maintenance treatment in adults with moderately to severely active CD. Patients (pts [N=644]) received VDZ 300mg IV induction therapy at Weeks (Wks) 0 and 2. At Wk6, pts with a clinical response (a ≥70-point decrease in CD Activity Index [CDAI]) were randomized 2:1 to double-blind maintenance therapy with VDZ 108mg SC or PBO SC every 2 wks. The primary endpoint was clinical remission at Wk52 (a CDAI score ≤150). Secondary endpoints were enhanced clinical response at Wk52 (a drop of ≥100 in CDAI score), corticosteroid (CS)-free clinical remission at Wk52, and clinical remission at Wk52 in anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-naïve pts. Exploratory endpoints included C-reactive protein levels, fecal calprotectin values, and VDZ immunogenicity. Safety was also assessed. Results: Among the 409 pts who responded to VDZ IV induction therapy at Wk6, 275 pts received VDZ SC and 134 received PBO as maintenance therapy; 61% and 53%, respectively, had prior exposure to anti-TNF therapy. Clinical endpoints are shown in Figure 1. At Wk52, 48.0% (VDZ SC) vs 34.3% (PBO) of pts were in clinical remission (p=0.008); enhanced clinical response was reached by 52.0% (VDZ SC) vs 44.8% (PBO) of pts (p=0.167). Among pts on concomitant CS at baseline (VDZ SC, n=95; PBO, n=44), 45.3% (VDZ SC) vs 18.2% (PBO) achieved CS-free clinical remission at Wk52. Among anti-TNF-naïve pts (VDZ SC, n=107; PBO, n=63), 48.6% (VDZ SC) vs 42.9% (PBO) were in clinical remission at Wk52. Biomarker endpoints are shown in Figure 2. Of pts with elevated C-reactive protein (>5 mg/L) at baseline (VDZ SC, n=168; PBO, n=80), 23.2% (VDZ SC) vs 17.5% (PBO) had normalized C-reactive protein (≤5 mg/L) at Wk52. The rates of normal fecal calprotectin levels (≤250 μg/g) were 60.5% (VDZ SC) vs 31.7% (PBO) at Wk52. Injection-site reactions were reported in <3% of VDZ SC-treated pts. Serious infections, malignancy, and liver injury were ≤5% for both arms. Anti-VDZ antibodies were detected in 2.5% of VDZ SC-treated pts. No new safety signals were observed. Conclusions: Maintenance therapy with the VDZ SC formulation confers efficacy and safety consistent with the therapeutic profile of the IV formulation in pts with CD who respond to IV induction.",,,,L2005915111,10.1016/S0016-5085(20)31167-7

In fact, incidence and mortality are increasing in many parts of the world, including the United States. Given that a number of systemic agents has recently been tested positive in phase 3 clinical trials, the objective of this review is to summarize the current treatment landscape for advanced HCC. Recent findings: Following the positive SHARP trial in 2008, sorafenib has been the only systemic agent for advanced HCC for almost a decade. However, in first line, lenvatinib was tested noninferior to sorafenib, and most recently, the combination of atezolizumab with bevacizumab was tested superior to sorafenib. In second line, regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab (the latter for patients with AFP ≥400 ng/ml) have shown prolonged overall survival compared with placebo. Summary: Systemic treatment options for advanced HCC have substantially increased over the past years. The combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab will likely become the new standard of care as it is the first treatment to report improved overall survival compared with sorafenib and the first, and so far only, positive phase 3 clinical trial for an immune-checkpoint inhibitor-containing regimen in advanced HCC.",,,32101985,L632933241,10.1097/MOG.0000000000000626

Before sorafenib came into wide use, TACE had been pointlessly carried out repeatedly. It was in the early 2010s that the concept of TACE refractory was advocated. Two retrospective studies from Japan indicated that conversion from TACE to sorafenib the day after patients were deemed as TACE refractory improved overall survival compared with continued TACE, according to the definition by the Japan Society of Hepatology. Nowadays, phase 3 trials have shown clinical benefits of several novel molecular target agents. Compared with the era of sorafenib, sequential treatments with these molecular target agents have gradually prolonged patients’ survival and have become major strategies in patients with HCC. Taking these together, conversion from TACE to systemic therapies at the time of TACE refractory, compared with before, may have a greater impact on survival and may be considered deeper in the decisions-making process in patients with unresectable HCC who are candidate for TACE. Up-to-date information on the concept of TACE refractory is summarized in this review. We believe that the survival of patients with unresectable HCC without both macrovascular invasion and extrahepatic metastasis may be dramatically improved by optimal timing of TACE refractory and switching to systemic therapies.",,,31937081,L2004153509,10.3350/cmh.2019.0021n

METHODS EV-101 is a phase I dose escalation/expansion study that enrolled patients with Nectin-4–expressing solid tumors (eg, metastatic urothelial carcinoma [mUC]) who progressed on $ 1 prior chemotherapy regimen and/or programmed death-1 receptor/programmed death ligand-1 [PD-(L)1] inhibitor, including a cohort of patients with mUC who received prior anti–PD-(L)1 therapy. Patients received escalating doses of EV up to 1.25 mg/kg on days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day cycle. Primary objectives were evaluation of safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics; antitumor activity was a secondary objective. RESULTS Enrolled patients with mUC (n = 155) were heavily pretreated, with 96% having prior platinum-based chemotherapy and 29% receiving $ 3 lines of prior treatment. Maximum tolerated dose of EV was not established; however, the recommended phase II dose was identified as 1.25 mg/kg. Rash, peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, alopecia, and nausea were the most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs); the most common TRAEs were grade 1-2 in severity. Among the 112 patients with mUC treated with single-agent EV 1.25 mg/kg, the investigator-assessed confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 43%, and duration of response was 7.4 months. Median overall survival (OS) was 12.3 months, and the OS rate at 1 year was 51.8%. Similar ORR and estimated median OS were observed in patients $ 75 years of age with and without prior anti–PD-(L)1 treatment, liver metastases, or upper-tract disease. CONCLUSION Single-agent EV was generally well tolerated and provided clinically meaningful and durable responses in patients with mUC; survival data are encouraging. A pivotal phase II and a confirmatory phase III study are ongoing.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02091999)",,32031899,L2005703313,10.1200/JCO.19.02044

T2D is closely associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is the most prevalent chronic liver disease worldwide. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe form of NAFLD, can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatic failure. No pharmacotherapies are established for NASH patients with T2D. Though vitamin E is established as a first-line agent for NASH without T2D, its efficacy for NASH with T2D recently failed to be proven. The effects of pioglitazone on NASH histology with T2D have extensively been established, but several concerns exist, such as body weight gain, fluid retention, cancer incidence, and bone fracture. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are expected to ameliorate NASH and NAFLD (LEAN study, LEAD trial, and E-LIFT study).

Recently, lenvatinib became the first agent in more than 10 years to receive approval as first-line therapy for unresectable HCC, along with the previously approved sorafenib. The objective of this study was to determine the comparative cost-effectiveness of lenvatinib and sorafenib as a first-line therapy of unresectable HCC. Materials and Methods: A state-transition model of unresectable HCC was developed in the form of a cost–utility analysis. The model time horizon was 5 years; the efficacy of the model was informed by the REFLECT trial, and costs and utilities were obtained from published literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model. Results: Lenvatinib dominated sorafenib in the base case analysis. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that lenvatinib remains a cost-saving measure in 64.87% of the simulations. However, if the cost of sorafenib was reduced by 57%, lenvatinib would no longer be the dominant strategy. Conclusion: Lenvatinib offered a similar clinical effectiveness at a lower cost than sorafenib, suggesting that lenvatinib would be a cost-saving alternative in treating unresectable HCC. However, lenvatinib may fail to remain cost-saving if a significantly cheaper generic sorafenib becomes available. Implications for Practice: This analysis suggests an actionable clinical policy that will achieve cost saving. This cost–utility analysis showed that lenvatinib had a similar clinical effectiveness at a lower cost than sorafenib, indicating that lenvatinib may be a cost-saving measure in patients with unresectable HCC, in which $23,719 could be saved per patient.

The advent of new direct-acting antivirals (DAA) has revolutionized patients’ chances of treatment and viral elimination. Currently, several DAA options are available on the market. Areas covered: This review focuses on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, tolerability and safety profile of DCV-TRIO, a twice-daily fixed-dose combination of daclatasvir, asunaprevir and beclabuvir approved in Japan for the treatment of genotype 1 HCV infection. Expert opinion: The DCV-TRIO combination achieved good response rates in genotype 1 patients (SVR12 ≥ 95% in naïve subtype 1b), independently from IL28B genotype, cirrhotic status and prior interferon exposure. On the other hand, unsatisfying response rates were reported in DAA-experienced patients and the risk of RAS selection should not be underestimated. Moreover, DCV-TRIO lacks differentiation from its earlier-launched DAA rivals, presents an inconvenient twice-daily dosing schedule and is not recommended in patients with advanced liver and kidney disease. All these drawbacks considerably limit its effective commercial potential. However, it can be a therapeutic option against HCV in tailored approaches according to the needs of different markets across the world.

Recently, lenvatinib was shown to be non-inferior to sorafenib, while regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab were shown to be superior to placebo in patients failing sorafenib. In addition, trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors reported encouraging efficacy signals. However, apart from alpha-fetoprotein, which is used to select patients for ramucirumab, no biomarkers are available to identify patients that may respond to a specific treatment. Different synergisms have been postulated based on the potential interplay between antiangiogenic drugs and immunotherapy, with several clinical trials currently testing this hypothesis. Indeed, encouraging preliminary results of phase I studies of bevacizumab plus atezolizumab and lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab have led to the design of ongoing phase III trials, including both antiangiogenics and immune checkpoint inhibitors in the front-line setting. Other important phase II studies have tested molecular therapies directed against different novel targets, such as transforming growth factor-beta, MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor), and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4. These studies integrated translational research with the aim of better defining the biological tumour profile and identifying tumour and blood biomarkers that select patients who may really benefit from a specific molecular therapy.

Date of Publication: 1 Feb 2020","2020","72","2","288","306","1 Feb 2020","In 2010, modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria were proposed as a way of adapting the RECIST criteria to the particularities of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We intended to overcome some limitations of RECIST in measuring tumour shrinkage with local and systemic therapies, and also to refine the assessment of progression that could be misinterpreted with conventional RECIST 1.1, due to clinical events related to the natural progression of chronic liver disease (development of ascites, enlargement of lymph nodes, etc.). mRECIST has served its purpose since being adopted or included in clinical practice guidelines (European, American and Asian) for the management of HCC; it has also been instrumental for assessing response and time-to-event endpoints in several phase II and III investigations. Nowadays, mRECIST has become the standard tool for measurement of radiological endpoints at early/intermediate stages of HCC. At advanced stages, guidelines recommend both methods. mRECIST has been proven to capture higher objective response rates in tumours treated with molecular therapies and those responses have shown to be independently associated with better survival. With the advent of novel treatment approaches (i.e. immunotherapy) and combination therapies there is a need to further refine and clarify some concepts around the performance of mRECIST. Similarly, changes in the landscape of standard of care at advanced stages of the disease are pointing towards progression-free survival as a potential primary endpoint in some phase III investigations, as effective therapies applied beyond progression might mask overall survival results. Strict recommendations for adopting this endpoint have been reported.

It is part of a multisystem disease affecting other organs such as the kidneys, heart and blood vessels, and is closely associated with the components of the metabolic syndrome. Physicians managing patients with NASH should not only focus on the management of NASH, but also on associated comorbidities in individual patients. The approaches to treatment of NASH include either limiting energy surplus alone, or in combination with targeting of downstream pathways of inflammation and fibrosis. In this mini-review, we discuss the currently available treatment options for NASH, as well as those in late-stage clinical trials. We discuss the challenges of managing these patients with a limited number of approved therapies, as well as managing advanced-stage patients with NASH and cirrhosis. We also discuss the specific management of comorbidities in NASH patients, in particular diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular diseases. Finally, we present the screening protocols for both hepatocellular carcinoma and extrahepatic malignancies in these patients.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02548351)",,32077609,L2004314047,10.1111/liv.14355

With a greater number of systemic agents available, the role of LRTs has become a topic of debate, specifically regarding when to transition to systemic therapy in unresectable HCC and the potential opportunities for combining locoregional and systemic therapies. Trials of immuno-oncology agents (notably T cell checkpoint inhibitors) are ongoing in the advanced disease setting and these agents also present opportunities for combination therapies, both with other systemic agents and with LRTs in earlier stage disease.

This trial excluded patients with a history of systemic chemotherapy, bile duct invasion, and Child-Pugh grade B. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib for these patients and in the real-world setting. Methods: Among patients who were administered lenvatinib for advanced HCC between April and October 2018 in Hokkaido University Hospital and related hospitals, we evaluated those who were followed for more than 2 months and whose treatment response was evaluated via dynamic computed tomography at baseline and 2 months after treatment initiation. Meanwhile, patients were excluded if they had decompensated liver cirrhosis, were followed up less than 2 months, or were not evaluated at 2 months. Patients were also stratified according to compliance with the REFLECT inclusion criteria for further analysis. Results: A total of 41 patients were included; more than 50% did not meet the REFLECT inclusion criteria. In total, 5 (12.2%), 20 (48.8%), 12 (29.3%), and 4 (9.3%) showed complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease, respectively. The objective response rate was 61.2%. The objective response rate and disease control rate were similar between patients who did and did not meet the REFLECT inclusion criteria. Moreover, the safety profile was also similar between the two patient groups. Conclusion: Lenvatinib showed high early response rate and tolerability in patients with advanced HCC.

In the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial (NCT01908426), C significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) vs P in pts with previously treated advanced HCC. Here we evaluate clinical outcomes with C in the CELESTIAL trial based on AFP response or progression on treatment. Methods: 707 pts were randomized 2:1 to receive C (60 mg qd) or P. Eligible patients had a pathologic diagnosis of HCC, Child-Pugh score A, and ECOG PS ≤1. Pts received prior sorafenib and up to 2 lines of prior systemic therapy for HCC. Serum AFP levels were measured centrally at b and every 8 weeks thereafter. Outcomes were evaluated for pts with elevated b serum AFP (≥20 ng/mL) based on AFP response (≥20% decrease from b) or progression (≥20% increase from b) at week 8. Results: Overall, 331 pts (70%) in the C arm and 160 (68%) in the P arm had elevated b AFP levels, and 236 (50%) and 111 (47%), respectively, were evaluable for AFP response at Week 8. Among evaluable pts, 117 pts (50%) in the C arm vs 14 (13%) in the P arm had an AFP response and 72 (31%) vs 75 (68%), respectively, had AFP progression. Median OS with C was 16.1 mo for AFP responders vs 9.1 mo for non-responders (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.83), and median PFS with C was 7.3 mo vs 4.0 mo (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.75). For pts with AFP progression, median OS with C was 8.1 mo, and median PFS with C was 3.6 mo. Hazard ratios for OS and PFS with C also favored AFP responders over non-responders when analyzed according to best response through week 24 or using 50% decrease from b as the cutoff for response. Conclusions: AFP response rate was higher with C vs P, and AFP response was associated with longer OS and PFS with C for pts with previously treated advanced HCC.

This will include the currently studied, approved uses as well as the potential future roles of ICIs in the treatment of cancers of the hepatobiliary system through recent updates on ongoing studies and discussion of phase III studies underway. Currently, only two ICIs are approved for use in hepatobiliary cancers: nivolumab and pembrolizumab. First, pembrolizumab was approved for either microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or DNA mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) unresectable, or metastatic solid tumors, including HCC and biliary tract cancer (BTC) in May 2017. After CheckMate-040, nivolumab gained approval in late 2017 in the second-line setting for patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A or B7 liver disease. Pembrolizumab was granted FDA approval in 2018 in the second-line setting after publication of KEYNOTE-224 for patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A liver disease. All three approvals were independent of PD-L1 tumor or immune cell expression.

Methods: A Markov model was developed to mimic the disease process of postoperative pancreatic cancer, encompassing three health states (relapse-free survival, recurrent disease, and death). Health outcomes and utility scores were derived from the phase III trial and available literature. Cost data were calculated using standard fee data from the West China Hospital for 2017. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were developed to explore model uncertainty. Results: Treatment with S-1 was estimated to yield 1.61 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at a cost of $25,696, whereas treatment with gemcitabine yielded 1.27 QALYs at a cost of $28,930. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of S-1 versus gemcitabine was $-9,490 per QALY. Based on the willingness-to-pay threshold of $25,841 per QALY, the net monetary benefit (NMB) was $15,786 for S-1 and $3,727 for gemcitabine, generating the incremental NMB of $12,059. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that the probabilities of S-1 and gemcitabine being cost-effective were 92% and 8%, respectively. Results were robust to changes in parameters.

LEN had an effect on overall survival (OS) compared to SOR, statistically confirmed by non-inferiority [OS: median = 13.6 months vs. 12.3 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79–1.06], and demonstrated statistically significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and the objective response rate (ORR) in the overall population. The results of a subset analysis that evaluated the efficacy and safety of LEN and SOR in the Japanese population are reported. Methods: The intent-to-treat population enrolled in Japan was analyzed. Results: Of 954 patients in the overall population, 168 Japanese patients were assigned to the LEN arm (N = 81) or the SOR arm (N = 87). Median OS was 17.6 months for LEN vs. 17.8 months for SOR (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.62–1.29). LEN showed statistically significant improvements over SOR in PFS (7.2 months vs. 4.6 months) and ORR (29.6% vs. 6.9%). The relative dose intensity of LEN and SOR in the Japanese population was lower than in the overall population. Frequently observed, related adverse events included palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES), hypertension, decreased appetite, and proteinuria in the LEN arm, and PPES, hypertension, diarrhea, and alopecia in the SOR arm.

Results: Sorafenib was approved for treatment of unresectable HCC in 2007 and remained the only therapy with proven survival benefit in advanced HCC for several years. Lenvatinib, another tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, was recently shown to have non-inferior survival vs sorafenib and is another first-line treatment option. The tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, regorafenib and cabozantinib, were shown to significantly improve survival in the second-line setting after sorafenib failure. Ramucirumab, a VEGF inhibitor, can also improve survival in the second-line setting among patients with AFP ≥ 400 ng/dL. Phase II data highlight potential durable objective responses with immune checkpoint inhibitors, prompting conditional FDA approval of nivolumab and pembrolizumab in the second-line setting; however, recent phase III data have failed to demonstrate improved survival compared to other treatment options. Ongoing trials are evaluating combination immune checkpoint inhibitor and immune checkpoint inhibitors with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors or VEGF inhibitors in hopes of further increasing objective responses and overall survival in this patient population.

Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2020","2020","82",,,,"1 Jan 2020","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks among the most common cancers worldwide and remains to be a major global health care problem. Until 2007, no effective therapies were available for patients after failure of locoregional approaches, and the approval of sorafenib as the first systemic agent with efficacy in patients suffering from advanced HCC marked a new era in the treatment of this deadly disease. However, it took nearly 10 years until the portfolio of effective drugs finally expanded and additional substances showed activity in both first and further lines of treatment. Since their recent approval, these novel substances have substantially changed the field of palliative treatment strategies in patients with advanced HCC, and their sequential application has demonstrated their potential to significantly prolong patient survival in the palliative setting. With the recently communicated data from the first positive immuno-oncology trial in HCC, it appears highly likely that the implementation of IO concepts will result in a further improvement of patient prognosis. Although locoregional approaches remain an integral component of meaningful treatment concepts for patients with BCLC-B stage HCC, repetitive interventions bear the risk of a progressive deterioration of liver function. More than ever, in order to implement long-term therapeutic concepts and exploit the full potential of systemic treatment strategies, it is of utmost importance to maintain a fine balance between anti-tumor activity and toxicity.

Date of Publication: 2020","2020","12",,"3721","3729","2020","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent primary liver cancer and predominantly develops in patients with liver cirrhosis. In patients with advanced disease, such as extra-hepatic extension or portal vein involvement, and with intermediate disease unsuitable for locoregional therapies, systemic therapy is recommended, if liver function and performance status are adequate. Following a decade of negative Phase III trials since the approval of sorafenib, more recently several drugs have proven efficacy both in first line versus sorafenib (lenvatinib) or in second line versus placebo (regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab). In this review, we summarize the preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the use of ramucirumab, a recombinant IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), in HCC. Following the results of the REACH trial, that was negative in the overall study population but identified a subgroup that could benefit from ramucirumab treatment, the REACH-2 trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, designed to assess ramucirumab as second line in patients with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥400 ng/mL. The results of REACH-2 were published in February 2019, leading to Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approval of the drug as second-line agent for advanced HCC (after sorafenib) in patients with AFP ≥400 ng/mL. For the first time in the history of systemic treatments for HCC, a predictive factor of efficacy was identified. In this review, we also discuss the potential clinical development of systemic treatments in HCC, focusing on combination therapies with immunotherapy (following the recent results of the combination of atezolizumab and bev-acizumab in the IMbrave 150 clinical trial) and treatment sequences as a way to maximize survival benefit.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03434379)",,,L2004418078,10.2147/CMAR.S216220

Several adverse events (AEs) are commonly reported during REG administration, and strategies for managing AEs in everyday clinical practice include supportive care, dose modifications and, when necessary, treatment withdrawal. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the schedule treatment modifications of REG associated with AEs across randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). Methods: Eligible studies included RCTs assessing standard dose REG versus placebo. Outcomes of interest included: AE-related permanent discontinuation, dose interruptions and dose reductions. Results: We retrieved all the relevant RCTs through PubMed/Med, Cochrane library and EMBASE: 7 eligible studies involving a total of 2099 patients (Regorafenib: 1362; placebo: 737) were included in our analysis. The use of REG was associated with higher incidence and risk of all outcomes of interest when compared with placebo. The incidences of permanent discontinuation, dose interruptions and dose reductions in patients receiving REG were 9.7%, 57.2% and 47%, respectively, versus 3.3%, 16.7% and 7.7% of placebo group; compared with placebo, the summary relative risks (RRs) of permanent discontinuation, dose interruptions and dose reductions in REG arm were 2.80 (95% CI 1.85–4.22), 3.21 (95% CI 2.59–3.99) and 6.02 (95% CI 3.28–11.03), respectively.

However, the validity of this criterion is barely verified. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of baseline HBV DNA levels and antiviral therapy on the oncological outcomes and liver functions of patients with HCC receiving anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Methods: We reviewed HCC trials related to anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy and whether they ruled out patients with increased HBV loads on clinicaltrials.gov. Then, for this retrospective study, we enrolled 253 HCC patients treated with anti-PD-1 blockade in our institution. Baseline information was compared between patients with low and high HBV loads. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared, and uni-variate and multivariate analyses were applied to identify potential risk factors for oncolo-gical outcomes and hepatic impairment. Results: Among 76 HCC clinical trials including 13,927 patients receiving anti-PD-(L)1 blockade, 41 (53.9%) excluded patients with relatively high baseline HBV loads. The PFS and OS did not differ significantly between patients with baseline HBV loads ≤ 2000 IU/mL and those with viral loads >2000 IU/mL (p=0.615 and 0.982). The incidence of hepatic impairment showed no association with the baseline HBV load (p=0.319). Patients receiving antiviral therapy had a better OS than those without antiviral therapy in the high baseline HBV load group (p= 0.001). Conclusion: High HBV loads did not compromise the clinical outcomes of HCC patients receiving anti-PD-1 blockade.

This systematic review and network meta-analysis (nma) aimed to compare the clinical benefits and toxicities of these treatments. Methods A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (rcts) was conducted to identify phase iii rcts in advanced hcc following sorafenib failure. Baseline characteristics and outcomes of placebo were examined for het-erogeneity. Primary outcomes of interest were extracted for results, including overall survival (os), progression-free survival (pfs), objective response rate (orr), grade 3/4 toxicities, and subgroups. An nma was conducted to compare both drugs through the intermediate placebo. Comparisons were expressed as hazard ratios (hrs) for os and pfs, and as risk difference (rd) for orr and toxicities. Subgroup analyses for os and pfs were also performed. Results Two rcts were identified (1280 patients) and compared through an indirect network; celestial (cabozantinib vs. placebo) and resorce (regorafenib vs. placebo). Baseline characteristics of patients in both trials were similar. Both trials also had similar placebo outcomes. Cabozantinib, compared with regorafenib, showed similar os [hazard ratio (hr): 1.21; 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.90 to 1.62], pfs (hr: 1.02; 95% ci: 0.78 to 1.34) and orr (−3.0%; 95% ci: −7.6% to 1.7%).

Date of Publication: 2020","2020","7",,"435","446","2020","Major vessel invasion is frequently observed in locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The most commonly involved major vessel is the portal vein; however, approximately 4% of patients with HCC have inferior vena cava (IVC) and/or right atrium (RA) invasion. Although these conditions have dismal prognoses, local treatments have not been regularly administered because they may affect systemic circulation. Owing to recent technolo- gical advances, various local treatments including surgery and external radiotherapy have increasingly been performed in these patients. Since irradiating tumorous lesions in the liver while preserving normal tissues is possible and major vessels are relatively resistant to radiation, external radiotherapy has been a feasible palliative modality for treating vessel-invasive HCC. In addition, systemic fatal complications that were initially a cause of concern have become rare after radiotherapy. While invasive procedures such as extracorporeal circulation or hepatic vascular exclusion may be required, pioneering surgeons have performed surgical resections in selected patients and have obtained promising results. Surgery has shown the best survival outcomes compared to other treatment options including radiotherapy, but the possibility of perioperative morbidity should be considered. In addition, a combination of local treatment and novel systemic agents, which demonstrated better survival and response rates than sorafenib, is expected to maximize therapeutic effects.

Date of Publication: 2020","2020","12","5","2099","2109","2020","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer with high morbidity and mortality. Poorer differentiation status indicates worse prognosis of HCC patients. Regain of better differentiation status may improve the prognosis. Differentiation therapy for HCC is based on the fact that agents may reverse the dedifferentiation process from hepatocytes to HCC cells and thus improve tumor differentiation status. Reversal of progenitor-like property and restoration of hepatic characteristics are main objectives of HCC differentiation therapy. Comprehending the mechanisms of HCC dedifferentiation provides ideas for drug design. Diverse dysregulated molecules and signalings cooperatively cause HCC dedifferentiation. Dysregulation of liver enriched transcription factors, especially hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, was a critical determinant of HCC dedifferentiation. Aberrant pivotal signaling molecules such as transforming factor-β, β-catenin and Yes-associated protein caused disordered signalings, which promoted HCC dedifferentiation. Loss of epithelial morphology during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) concurred with HCC dedifferentiation. Some EMT-related molecules exerted double-sided role in concurrently inducing EMT and HCC dedifferentiation. Besides, microRNAs (e.g. miR-122 and miR-148a) as well as some impressive proteins (i.e. KLF4, gankyrin and CHD1L) functioned in manipulating HCC differentiation status. Restoring normal expression levels of these molecules could induce HCC differentiation and inhibited malignant tumor behaviors. Based on the knowledge above, some agents have been found effective in lab, but need more data to support their reliability. Additionally, peretinoin as a potential drug is in progress of several phase III clinical trials. It’s promising that differentiation therapy for HCC may be a part of options in future HCC treatment.",,,,L2006157026,

Immune checkpoint suppression has become the most effective treatment option for liver cancer. The strategies used for immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting cancer therapies have been affected by some significant successes, including blocking the advanced-stage malignant tumor by death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand (PDL-1), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4) pathways. T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains (TIGIT) is an immune checkpoint that participates in tumor immune surveillance. Mainly expressed on T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and other antigen-presenting cells (APCs), it diminishes cytokine production and exhibits strong suppressive properties. TIGIT achieves a more active antitumor immune response and highlights a pivotal role for cancer immunotherapy. Preclinical studies have found inhibitory effects using a targeted approach. Monotherapy targeting TIGIT or in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of patients with advanced solid malignancies have demonstrated improved antitumor immune responses. Due to the high tumor heterogeneity of liver cancer, immune checkpoint suppression therapy still needs further exploration. Therefore, we provide insights into the characteristics of TIGIT and the immune system in HCC.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03563716, NCT04047862, NCT04150965, NCT04256421)",,,L2007371329,

Objective: In this post hoc analysis, we investigated OS in lenvatinib-and sorafenib-treated patients from the REFLECT study, who then received subsequent anticancer medication during the survival follow-up period. Methods: The follow-up period commenced at the first off-treatment visit after stopping the study medication and continued until study termination, withdrawal of consent, or death. OS and objective response rate were calculated for patients who did or did not receive poststudy anticancer medication for both treatment arms, as well as for the overall cohort. We investigated the subset of patients who responded to first-line treatment and subsequently received anticancer medication. Results: The OS for patients initially randomized to first-line lenvatinib (versus first-line sorafenib) and who then received any subsequent anticancer medication was 20.8 vs. 17.0 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87; 95% CI 0.67-1.14).

Date of Publication: 2020","2020","38","4",,,"2020","Background: Intermediate-stage HCC is a heterogenous population with subgroups of patients that do not benefit from TACE. Hence, we conducted a matched cohort study to compare the efficacy of lenvatinib to TACE in intermediate-stage HCC patients with large or multinodular tumours exceeding the up-to-7 criteria. Methods:This study first identified 642 consecutive patients with HCC initially treated with lenvatinib or conventional TACE (cTACE) between January 2006 and December 2018. Of these patients, 176 who received lenvatinib or cTACE as an initial treatment and met the eligibility criteria [unresectable, beyond the up-to-7 criteria, without prior TACE/systemic therapy, no vascular invasion, no extrahepatic spread and Child-Pugh A liver function] were selected. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for patients' demographics. Results: After propensity-score matching, outcome of 30 patients prospectively treated with lenvatinib (14 in clinical trials [1 Phase II and 13 Phase III REFLECT trial], 1 in early access program and 15 in real world setting) and 60 patients treated with cTACE as the initial treatment was compared. The lenvatinib group showed a higher objective response rate (73.3% vs. 33.3%; p < 0.001) and longer median progression-free survival than the cTACE group (16.0 vs. 3.0 months; p < 0.001). Median overall survival was also significantly longer in the lenvatinib group than in the cTACE group (37.9 vs. 21.3 months; hazard ratio: 0.48, p < 0.01). The change of ALBI score from baseline to the end of treatment were-2.61 to-2.61 for 30 patients in lenvatinib group (p = 0.254) and-2.66 to-2.09 in cTACE group (p < 0.01), respectively. Conclusions:In patients with large or multinodular intermediate-stage HCC exceeding the up-to-7 criteria with Child-Pugh A liver function, who usually do not benefit from TACE, lenvatinib is associated with better outcome than TACE. In particular, leventinib is associated with preservation of hepatic function during treatment while TACE is associated with deterioration of hepatic function.",,,,L630961162,10.1200/JCO.2020.38.4_suppl.522

Date of Publication: 2020","2020","38","4",,,"2020","Background: Lenvatinib (LEN) is approved for first-line treatment of uHCC. Baseline (BL) liver function (Child-Pugh score [CPS] and albumin-bilirubin grade [ALBI]) was prognostic in uHCC patients (pts) who received sorafenib (SOR) but has not been assessed with LEN in uHCC. Here, we report post hoc analysis of BL liver function and efficacy/safety outcomes from the phase 3 REFLECT study. Methods: Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety were stratified by BL ALBI or CPS. OS and PFS were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Independent radiologic review utilized mRECIST criteria for ORR. Safety was assessed using NCI-CTCAE, version 4.0. Results: Liver function measured by ALBI and CPS seemed to be prognostic for OS and ORR. Median OS was longer in ALBI grade 1 (ALBI-1) vs grade 2 (ALBI-2) pts or for CPS-5 vs CPS-6 on either treatment arm and was longer for LEN vs SOR. ORR was higher in pts with better ALBI or CPS and for LEN vs SOR. Rates of treatmentemergent adverse events grade ≥3 were lower with better BL liver function (ALBI-1 vs ALBI-2: 70% vs 86%; CPS-5 vs CPS-6: 72% vs 86%). Study-drug withdrawal, dose reduction, and dose interruption occurred more often in pts with worse BL liver function. Conclusions: This post hoc analysis suggests ALBI (by OS, PFS and ORR) and CPS (by ORR) may be prognostic in uHCC pts and that BL liver function may be linked with efficacy/safety outcomes. This analysis also found that LEN provided benefit vs SOR for uHCC, regardless of BL liver function.

Methods: This prospective, observational trial aims to recruit 1000 pts with uHCC for whom a decision to treat with regorafenib has been made by the treating physician prior to enrollment according to the local health authority approved label. The primary endpoint is the incidence of treatmentemergent adverse events (TEAEs) and dose modifications due to TEAEs (NCI-CTCAE v4.03).

Tumor response and progression are assessed per investigator according to local standard. An interim analysis includes the first 500 pts observed for ≥4 months. We report baseline characteristics, starting dose, and treatment duration for the interim analysis. Results: Of 498 pts evaluable for analysis, median age was 67 years (range: 22-91) and 84% were male. 59% were from Asia.

Cox models evaluated treatment effect of RPP on OS, and prognostic implications of RPP on OS (adjusting baseline ECOG PS, AFP, macrovascular invasion, arm) and on PPS (adjusting ECOG PS, AFP at progression). Results: RPP incidence in the pooled population was: NEH 39%; NIH 24%; EHG 39%; IHG 37%.

Date of Publication: 2020","2020","38","4",,,"2020","Background: Intermediate-stage HCC, as defined as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage B, is a heterogeneous disease in terms of liver function and tumor load. REACH (NCT01140347) and REACH-2 (NCT02435433) investigated ramucirumab (RAM) in patients (pts) with HCC after prior sorafenib (SOR), with REACH-2 enrolling only pts with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL. An exploratory analysis of outcomes by BCLC stage was performed. Methods: All pts had HCC (BCLC stage C or B disease refractory/not amenable to locoregional therapy), Child-Pugh A, ECOG PS 0-1, and prior SOR. Pts were randomized to RAM 8 mg/kg or Placebo (P) Q2W. A pooled meta-analysis of independent pt data (stratified by study) from REACH-2 and REACH (AFP ≥400 mg/mL) was performed. Prognosis of BCLC staging in overall survival (OS) was evaluated by multivariate Cox PH model (adjusted for baseline AFP and treatment (trt) arm); Trt effects in BCLC stage B and C by Cox PH model; median OS/PFS were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1, disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events (AEs) were also reported by BCLC. Liver function was assessed at baseline and prior to each trt with the Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) linear predictor. Results: Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between trt arms in each BCLC stage. BCLC staging trended as an independent prognosis factor for OS [B v C; HR = 0.756 (0.546, 1.046)]. A consistent trt benefit for RAM v P was observed across staging (Table). Grade ≥3 AEs were consistent with observations from both individual studies; hypertension was the most frequent grade ≥3 AE.

It is unclear whether patients with modified eligibility criteria (MEC) benefit as well as patients with strict eligibility criteria (SEC) according to the SHARP-criteria. Methods and Patients: Within this retrospective single center analysis we initially reviewed electronic records of 987 patient diagnosed with HCC, who were treated between January 2008 and October 2017. Finally, 293 patients received sorafenib and were eligible for final analysis. Data of risk-factors, liver function, BCLC stage, ECOG, laboratory values, radiological findings, treatment modalities, and follow-up were recorded until 31.12.2017. Primary outcomes were median overall survival (OS) of patients with MEC and SEC according to the SHARP-criteria, as well as the safety-profile during treatment. Furthermore, a secondary endpoint was median OS depending on risk-factors. Results: The median OS was prolonged with 12.0 months in patients with SEC compared to 10.7 months in the SHARP-trial itself. Even patients with MEC, representing real-life practice, reached a median OS of 10.0 months without disadvantages concerning the safety of the drug. The incidence of drug-related adverse events (mainly grade 1 or 2) was 80.2% in patients with MEC and only 70.0% in patients with SEC compared to 80.0% in the SHARP-trial. Major adverse events included fatigue (36%), diarrhea (35%), and hand-foot skin syndrome (31%). A trend to prolonged median OS was demonstrated in patients with chronic hepatitis C (15.0 months in the MEC-cohort and 25.0 months in the SEC-cohort) compared to alcohol- or hepatitis b (9.0 months and 10.0 months)-related underlying liver disease (p = n.s.). Conclusion: Patients with advanced HCC do benefit from systemic treatment with sorafenib under real life conditions reaching a similar outcome. Patients with SEC, according to the SHARP-criteria, displayed an even prolonged median OS, which goes along with previous data from several clinical phase III trials, in which patients receiving sorafenib in a control arm, also demonstrated prolonged OS compared to the SHARP-trial.",,,,L631350178,10.1055/s-0039-3402215

This study aimed to investigate to efficacy and safety of preoperative neoadjuvant transarterial infusion chemotherapy (TAI) with FOLFOX regimen for these patients. Methods: In this prospective, phase III, randomized, open-labeled, controlled clinical trial, resectable BCLC stage A/B HCC patients beyond Milan criteria were randomly assigned (1:1) before hepatectomy to receive either neoadjuvant TAI (NT group) or operation directly without any neoadjuvant treatment (OP group). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), the secondary endpoints are disease-free survival (DFS), recurrence free survival (RFS), and safety. Results: Between March, 2016 and June 2019, 136 patients were randomly assigned to NT group (n=68) or OP group (n=68), with 64 patients in each group included in efficacy and safety analysis. Clinicopathological characteristics were balanced between the two groups. The 1- and 2-year OS rates for NT group were 93.9% and 75.9%, and were 78.5% and 57.5% for OP group, respectively. The OS between the two group had no difference (p=0.220). The 6-, 12-, and 18-month PFS rates for NT group were 80.1%, 45.8%, and 33.4%, and were 45.9%, 21.0%, and 17.5% for OP group, respectively.

Date of Publication: 2020","2020","14",,"S257",,"2020","Background and aims: Regorafenib has been proved as 2nd line systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients through phase III trial. We analyzed the real-world data to assess clinical efficacy and safety. Method: This study was a multicenter, non-comparative, retrospective cohort study. Between July 2017 and May 2019, 133 patients with HCC who received regorafenib after sorafenib therapy were eligible for inclusion in this study. Tumor response was assessed according to modified RECIST criteria. We evaluated time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of regorafenib therapy including prediction factors for prognosis. Results: Their median age was 60 years, and most patients (82%) were male. Hepatitis B virus infection (68.4%) was the most common etiology of HCC. Most of patients (98.5%) were classified as Child- Pugh A except 2. Eighty-four percent of patients had extrahepatic metastasis and Vascular invasion was presented in 45.1%. Three patients (2.7%) achieved complete response and 11 (9.8%) patients had a partial response resulting in objective response rate 12.5% in 112 available patients for response assessment. The disease control rate (DCR) was 34.8%. Median treatment duration of regorafenib was 2.6 months (1.5-4.7 months). During follow up, 38 patients died. On regorafenib, the median OS was 10.0 months (95% CI 8.4-11.6), the median PFS survival was 2.7 months (95% CI 2.5- 2.9 months), and the median TTP was 2.6 months (95% CI 2.4-2.8). The OS rate from the start of regorafenib at 6 months and 1 year were 71.2%, and 38.7%. In multivariate analysis, Child-Pugh score >5 (HR 3.037 95% CI 1.46-6.314; p = 0.003), AFP >400 ng/ml (HR 5.9; 95% CI 2.608-13.349; p<0.001), and TTP on sorafenib ≥median (HR 0.441; 95% CI 0.310-0.629; p<0.001) were independently associated with OS. In exploratory analysis from the time of sorafenib administration, the median OS from sorafenib administration was 25.8 (95% CI 8.7-42.9 months). The 1 year and 2 years survival rate were 79.5% and 53.1%. Conclusion: Regorafenib was effective in patients with advanced HCC who failed first-line sorafenib in real-life setting, consistent with previous clinical trial.

PURPOSE: We investigated whether celecoxib can alleviate HFS, improve patients' quality of life and increase survival when administered in conjunction with active therapy METHOD: Our randomized, open-label study prospectively enrolled 116 advanced HCC patients receiving sorafenib as targeted therapy from July 2015 to July 2016. All patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computer-generated sequence to receive sorafenib with or without celecoxib. Sorafenib-related AEs were recorded, Survival was compared between the two groups RESULT(S): Compared to the Sorafenib group, the SoraCele group had lower incidence rates of ≥ grade 2 and grade 3 HFS (63.8% vs 29.3%, P < 0.001; 19.0% vs 3.4%, P = 0.008, respectively), hair loss, rash and abdominal pain.

"Lenvatinib for the first-line treatment of advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: A cost-effectiveness analysis from a Canadian perspective","Sabapathy S., Marotta P., Pan J.J., Geadah M., Trueman D., Hellmund C., Kamboj L.","Canadian Liver Journal (2020) 3:1 (120-121). Date of Publication: 2020","2020","3","1","120","121","2020","BACKGROUND: Survival rates for advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) are low, and sorafenib is currently the only systemic therapy funded for first-line treatment in Canada. Lenvatinib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, recently received a funding recommendation by the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR). In the Phase III REFLECT trial, lenvatinib met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority in overall survival (OS) versus sorafenib (13.6 months versus 12.1 months; hazard ratio 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.79-1.06) and demonstrated superiority in secondary endpoints progression- free survival, time to progression and objective response rate. A greater proportion of sorafenib patients received post-progression therapies, which may explain the longer median OS in the sorafenib arm of REFLECT compared with previous studies. PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of lenvatinib versus sorafenib for the first-line treatment of uHCC, from the perspective of the Canadian Ministry of Health. METHOD: A partitioned survival model was developed to model the incremental costs and benefits (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) associated with lenvatinib treatment, with health states representing progression-free disease, progressed disease, and death. Trial results were used to estimate the proportion of patients in each health state over time, with extrapolation performed to estimate health state membership beyond the trial period. Adjustment was made for baseline imbalances between trial arms, including baseline alpha-fetoprotein concentration, body weight and Child-Pugh score. Utility values in each health state were determined using EQ-5D-3L data captured in REFLECT, and adverse events included in the model were Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in ≥5% of patients in either treatment arm. To reflect confidential listing agreements that may exist between manufacturers and Canadian payers, one scenario explored the impact of reducing the price of sorafenib by 15%. Another scenario adjusted the OS HR for the imbalance in post-progression therapy use in REFLECT and aimed to align with the Canadian HCC landscape by including regorafenib as the only second-line treatment option. RESULT(S): In the base-case and all scenarios lenvatinib was dominant due to reduced costs and increased benefits versus sorafenib (see table). The reduction in costs was driven mainly by reduced primary drug costs in the lenvatinib arm, and the increase in QALYs was likely due to lenvatinib patients spending more time in the progression-free health state. The adjustment for post-progression therapies balanced the impact of post-progression therapies on OS between treatment arms, resulting in increased incremental QALYs. CONCLUSION(S): Lenvatinib is a cost-effective first-line treatment option for patients with uHCC in Canada. (Table Presented) .",,,,L632171757,

Baseline (BL) liver function (Child-Pugh score [CPS] and albumin-bilirubin [ALBI] grade) was prognostic in uHCC patients (pts) who received SOR but has not been assessed with LEN in uHCC. PURPOSE: Here, we report a post hoc analysis of BL liver function and efficacy/safety outcomes from the phase 3 REFLECT study. METHOD: Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety were stratified by BL ALBI or CPS. OS and PFS were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Independent radiologic review utilized mRECIST criteria for ORR. Safety was assessed using NCICTCAE, version 4.0. RESULT(S): Liver function measured by ALBI and CPS seemed to be prognostic for OS and ORR. Median OS was longer in ALBI grade 1 (ALBI-1) vs grade 2 (ALBI-2) pts or for CPS-5 vs CPS-6 on either treatment arm and was longer for LEN vs SOR. ORR was higher in pts with better ALBI or CPS and for LEN vs SOR. Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events grade ≥3 were lower with better BL liver function (ALBI-1 vs ALBI-2: 70% vs 86%; CPS-5 vs CPS-6: 72% vs 86%). Study-drug withdrawal, dose reduction, and dose interruption occurred more often in pts with worse BL liver function (Table). CONCLUSION(S): This post hoc analysis suggests ALBI (by OS, PFS and ORR) and CPS (by ORR) may be prognostic in uHCC pts and that BL liver function may be linked with efficacy/safety outcomes. This analysis also found that LEN provided benefit vs SOR for uHCC, regardless of BL liver function. The benefit of LEN may be underestimated, as more ALBI-2 pts and fewer ALBI-1 pts received LEN vs SOR. (Table Presented) .",,,,L632171796,

Methods: This prospective, observational study aims to recruit 1000 pts with unresectable HCC for whom a decision to treat with REG was made by the treating physician prior to enrollment according to the local health authority approved label. The primary endpoint is the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and dose modifications due to TEAEs (NCICTCAE v4.03). Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (investigator assessed). This interim analysis includes the first 500 pts on study for ≥4 months. Results: Of 500 pts enrolled and observed for ≥4 months, 498 received REG and were evaluable (data cut-off: November 11, 2019). Pts were Child-Pugh A 67%, B 11%, C 1%, and missing/not evaluable 21%. Most pts (98%; n = 490) had received prior systemic therapy; 97% (n = 482) had received prior SOR. REG was second line treatment in 81% of pts (n = 403), third line or higher in 17% (n = 87), and first line in 2% (n = 8). Of the 403 pts who received REG second line, 398 (99%) received prior SOR. Among the 482 pts who received SOR in any prior line, the median duration of prior SOR was 4.8 months (interquartile range 2.5-9.6), 45% (n = 216) had a last daily SOR dose of 800 mg, and 8% (n = 40) had a TEAE leading to SOR discontinuation (SOR-intolerant).

However, the efficacy of these agents is not consistent across trials and in routine practice. The role of PD-L1 expression as a tumour-agnostic predictive correlate of response to ICIs remains unclear. We performed a pooled analysis of the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1-targeted ICI regimens as compared to standard of care (SoC) therapy according to PD-L1 expression, based on landmark clinical studies. Methods: We searched literature databases to identify phase III randomized controlled trials that compared anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies alone or in combination with chemotherapy or targeted agents against SoC therapy in the treatment of different tumor types. We reported efficacy data, in terms of OS, according to PD-L1 status. Log hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled across the studies overall and by PD-L1 status by inverse variance weighting. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Twenty-four studies including 17687 randomised patients with advanced lung, renal, urothelial, liver, breast, head and neck cancers and melanoma, were eligible for analysis. Efficacy according to PD-L1 immunohistochemical expression, with a 1% cutoff ( < 1% versus > 1%), was reported in 11 studies (7126 patients). Overall, ICI-containing regimes were significantly superior in terms of OS to SoC regimens (pooled HR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.68). When OS data were pooled according to PD-L1 expression, HR was 0.66; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.71 in PD-L1 < 1%, versus 0.62; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.68 in PD-L1 >1% (p = 0.7). Conclusions: The significant improvement in OS favoring the use of ICIs over SoC does not seem to be confined to patients with PD-L1-overexpressing tumours.

Patients greater than 60kg received 12mg/day and those less than 60kg received 8mg/day. There were 5 females and 26 males. Median age was 60 years (29-78 years). All patients were BCLC stage C. Child Pugh score was A in 20 patients, B in 9 patients and C in 2 patients. AFP was elevated in 25 (80.6%) patients. 26 patients received Lenvatinib as initial therapy, 3 received it after Sorafenib progression, and 2 received after Sorafenib and Nivolumab progression. 6 patients (19.35%) achieved partial response (PR), 12 (38.7%) had stable disease and 13 (41.9%) had progressive disease by recist criteria. ORR was 19.35% and disease control rate was 58%. 2 patients underwent TACE after achieving PR. The median PFS was 7 months. The common adverse events were hypertension, weight loss, palmar plantar rashes, dysphonia and fatigue. Grade 3 AEs occurred in 8 patients (25.8%). 10 patients (32.2%) required dose reduction due to side effects. Conclusions: Lenvatinib has demonstrated a high response rate and disease control rate in our patients. Achieving a PFS of 7 months is an improvement over our previous Sorafenib experience. Further followup will demonstrate the overall survival. It is well tolerated and most side effects can be managed with patient education. The major advantage has been that in contrast to Sorafenib, only 32.2% patients required dose reduction due to side effects. These results are practice changing and Lenvatinib has become our first line regimen in advanced HCC. Lenvatinib would provide a good backbone to combine immunotherapy as first line treatment in future.",,,,L632807240,10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.e16596

We report, to our knowledge, for the first time safety and efficacy data of an international, multicenter, realworld cohort of patients with advanced HCC treated with cabozantinib. Methods: Patients with HCC who were treated with cabozantinib were retrospectively identified across 10 centers in Austria and Germany. Patients' characteristics, side effects, duration of treatment and survival data were analyzed until January 17, 2020. Results:74 patients were identified of whom 65 patients were male (88%) and 9 were female (12%). The median age at the start of cabozantinib treatment was 66 years. The most common underlying liver diseases included hepatitis C in 15 (20%), hepatitis B in 6 (8%), alcohol in 17 (23%) and NAFLD/NASH in 20 (27%) patients, respectively. 64 patients (86%) had BCLC stage C and 43 patients (58%) were Child Pugh A. Cabozantinib was used as systemic second-and third-line treatment in 37 (50%), and 25 (34%) patients, respectively. In the remaining patients cabozantinib was used in further lines. The median starting dose was 40 mg (20-60 mg). In 26 patients (35%) a dose reduction due to side effects was performed. Following best responses under cabozantinib were documented: partial response in 4 (5%), stable disease in 22 (30%), and progressive disease in 24 (32%) patients, respectively. 24 patients (32%) had not yet been evaluable. The median duration of cabozantinib treatment was 4.4 months. 35 patients (47%) had died at day of data analysis. The median overall survival from start of cabozantinib treatment was 7.7 months. Most common adverse events were fatigue and diarrhea. Conclusions: Cabozantinib treatment was effective, safe and feasible in patients with advanced HCC. Patients in the real life setting had more advanced liver disease -only 58% of patients were Child A. Duration of treatment was similar to the phase 3 trial (CELESTIAL). However, overall survival was shorter, probably due to more advanced liver disease.",,,,L632807452,10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.e16668
"Effect of an lncRNA-associated ceRNA regulatory network in MVIpositive hepatocellular carcinoma on their sensitivity to sorafenib","Luo Z., Bi X.","Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020) 38:15. Date of Publication: 2020","2020","38","15",,,"2020","Background: Microvascular invasion (MVI) is a histological feature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) related to aggressiveness. But different sensitivity to first line targeted drug, sorafenib, in MVI(+)HCC has been observed. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can act as microRNA (miRNA) sponges to regulate protein-coding gene expression; so lncRNAs are considered as a major part of competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and have attracted growing attention. We explored the regulatory mechanisms and functional roles of lncRNAs as ceRNAs in MVI(+)HCC, and ceRNA network's potential impact on prognosis and sensitivity to sorafenib in MVI(+)HCC patient. Methods: We studied the expression profiles, prognostic value of lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA from MVI(+)HCC patients, established a prognosis-related network of dysregulated ceRNAs and analyzed its role in sensitivity to sorafenib and radiomics features by bioinformatics methods. Results: A ceRNA network including 13 lncRNAs, 3 miRNAs, and 2 mRNAs specific to MVI+ HCC was established. 6 lncRNAs (ARHGEF7-AS1, ATP2B2-IT1, LINC00330, MUC2, TLR8-AS1 and ZNF385D-AS1), 2 miRNAs (hsa-mir-206 and hsa-mir-373) and two mRNAs (PAX3, SIK1) were prognostic biomarkers for MVI(+)HCC. PAX3 was an unfavorable prognostic gene (HR = 1.9, 95%CI 1.01 ∼ 3.60), while SIK1 favored the prognosis (HR = 0.4, 95%CI 0.19 ∼ 0.85). PAX3as a stratification in recurrence predicting model was used to identify MVI(+)HCC with high or low recurrence risk. Datamining into the dataset of phase 3 STORM trial showed no difference in the influence of PAX3 level on the outcome between sorafenib HCC group and placebo HCC group. However, deep datamining into GDSC dataset revealed our high PAX3 group in MVI(+)HCC related to resistance to sorafenib (P = 0.0039). Radiomics features were extracted from CT of MVI(+)HCC, and texture analysis in MVI(+)HCCs is ongoing. Conclusions: The proposed ceRNA network may help elucidate the regulatory mechanism by which lncRNAs function as ceRNAs and contribute to the pathogenesis of MVI in HCC. Importantly, the candidate lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs involved in the ceRNA network have shown to be potential therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for MVI(+)HCC. PAX3 might play a vital role in the mechanism of sorafenib resistance in MVI(+)HCC, exclusively, this aggressive HCC subtype. The ongoing experiments on radiomics might add potent supports to identify sorafenib sensitive MVI(+)HCC.",,,,L632807476,10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.e16615

PEMBRO, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, was granted accelerated approval for the treatment of patients (pts) with HCC after sorafenib therapy. We assessed the safety and efficacy of LEN + PEMBRO in uHCC. Methods: In this phase 1b trial (NCT03006926), pts received LEN 12 mg/day (bodyweight [BW] ≥60 kg) or 8 mg/day (BW <60 kg) orally + PEMBRO 200 mg IV on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability for Part 1 and objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) by mRECIST and RECIST v1.1 per independent imaging review (IIR) in the 1L setting for Part 2. Results: 104 pts (part 1, n=6; part 2, n=98) were enrolled. No DLTs were reported in Part 1; 100 pts were included in the 1L analysis of LEN + PEMBRO-4 pts (part 1) excluded due to prior sorafenib. At data cutoff (October 31, 2019) and median follow-up of 10.6 months, 37 pts continued treatment (LEN only, n=3; both drugs, n=34); median duration of treatment was 7.9 months (LEN, 7.6 months; PEMBRO, 7.4 months).

Here, we comprehensively examined clinicopathological factors and estimated their association with survival outcomes in aHCC patients treated with nivolumab. Methods: A total of 261 eligible patients from 5 high-volume centers who were treated with nivolumab between June 9, 2012 and March 14, 2018 and had measurable diseases were reviewed. We reviewed more than 80 clinicopathological factors and categorized them into 6 areas: 1) demographics (n = 16); 2) baseline laboratory values (n = 19); 3) tumor burden (n = 12); 4) previous treatment (n = 12); 5) treatment response (n = 5); 6) toxicity profiles (n = 18). Their association with survival outcomes were evaluated, and organspecific response evaluation, adapted from RECIST 1.1, was conducted. Results: Of the 261 patients, 218 (84%) had extrahepatic spread. The median follow-up time was 4.5 months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.8-2.8) and 6.3 months (95% CI, 5.0-8.2). Objective response rate was 15%. Subgroup analyses revealed that compensated liver function (Child-Pugh score A5/6), surrogate markers for low tumor burden (low AFP, low PIVKA, and low LDH level), inflammatory markers (low C-reactive protein [CRP], low erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], low neutrophilto-lymphocyte ratio [NLR], high lymphocyte-tomonocyte ratio [LMR]), and low intrahepatic tumor burden were significantly associated with longer OS. A total of 456 individual lesions (liver, n = 249; lung, n = 124; lymph node, n = 35; others such as boner soft tissues, n = 48) were examined. Organ-specific response rates (hepatic tumor, 9%; lung, 25%; lymph node, 37%; others metastasis, 15%) were different, of which intrahepatic tumor was the least responsive organ to ICI treatment in aHCC. Conclusions: Underlying liver function, the tumor extent and burden, and the degree of plasma lymphocytes are crucial for determining tumor response to ICI in aHCC. Antitumor immune response to ICI differs in an organ-specific manner.

Date of Publication: 2020","2020","38","15",,,"2020","Background: Advanced HCC is a deadly disease with few systemic therapeutic options. VEGF blockade potentiates the effect of PD-1 inhibition by opposing the immunosuppressive effects of VEGF-A (increased DC maturation, enhanced T-cell infiltration, reduced MDSCs and Tregs in tumors). A sBLA has been submitted for an anti-PD-L1 + anti-VEGF combination as 1L treatment for advanced HCC. Penpulimab is a novel humanized anti-PD-1 IgG1 antibody with complete removal of Fc receptor mediated effect, and featuring slow antigen binding off-rate and high receptor occupancy. Anlotinib is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor selective for VEGF receptors 1/2/3, FGF receptors 1-4, PDGF receptors α and β, and c-kit. Methods: In this openlabel, multicenter phase Ib/II study, treatment-naive pts with advanced HCC received penpulimab 200mg Q3W in combination with anlotinib 8mg QD (2 weeks on 1 week off) until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objectives were to assess antitumor activity by ORR (RECIST v1.1). The secondary objectives were to assess antitumor activity by DCR, DoR, TTP, and to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination. Results: As of Jan 14, 2020, 31 pts (median age 56 years [23-74], male 81%, ECOG 0/1 [64%/36%], BCLC B/C [23%/77%], HBV/HCV [61%/7%]) received combined therapy (a median of 6 [1-15] doses). Treatmentrelated adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 93.5% of pts (G3 in 9.7% [3/31], no G4, and leading to treatment discontinuation in 6.5% [2/31]). Most frequent TRAEs were increased AST (35.5%), increased ALT (29%), asthenia (22.6%), decreased platelet count (19.4%), increased blood bilirubin (19.4%), increased bilirubin conjugated (19.4%), and rash (16.1%). Of 25 evaluable pts (with the opportunity to be followed-up for ≥2 scans, 12 weeks), confirmed ORR was 24% (6/25) and DCR was 84% (21/25). Five responders remained in response with DoR ranging 1.4+ to 6.9+ months. Median TTP was not reached and 6m-TTP rate was 63% (95% CI: 38%, 81%). Conclusions: Penpulimab in combination with anlotinib had a manageable safety profile and encouraging antitumor activities in patients with advanced HCC. No unexpected AEs were identified beyond the established safety profile for each agent.

"Comparison of response using mRECIST versus RECIST 1.1 Criteria in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: A retrospective analysis of multicenter clinical trials","Narang J., Bajpai S., Jarecha R., Sharma M., Bohnsack O.","Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020) 38:15. Date of Publication: 2020","2020","38","15",,,"2020","Background: mRECIST 2010 criteria for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) response assessment were focused on a concept of measuring viable tumor tissue showing enhancement in arterial phase of contrast enhanced CT/MRI, whereas RECIST 1.1 focuses mainly on the morphological measurements quantifying the tumor size irrespective of viability of the tumor and associated response to therapy. RECIST 1.1 does not address measures of antitumor activity other than tumor shrinkage, underestimating responses in HCC. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed multiple, phase III, multi-center clinical trials using both mRECIST and RECIST 1.1 criteria, read separately. The intent was to compare the overall responses at post-baseline assessments read independently by the two criteria. A total of 1682 subjects with 6159 post-baseline imaging timepoints were included in the analysis. The Overall response rate (ORR) as measured by sum of complete response (CR) and partial response(PR) and the Complete response rate (CRR) were evaluated. In addition, we also assessed the number of not evaluable (NE) time points by each criteria separately. We tested the following hypotheses 1. mRECIST may have better ORR and CRR compared to RECIST 1.1. 2. RECIST 1.1 may have more timepoints with Stable disease (SD) compared to mRECIST. 3. mRECIST may have more Not evaluable (NE) timepoints due to stringent imaging specifications. Results: The results are tabulated in the table below: Conclusions: The results above suggest that mRECIST shows more than double the CRR than RECIST 1.1, and the ORR is 62% higher using mRECIST than RECIST 1.1. Stable disease as expected was more commonly observed in RECIST 1.1 analysis. A NE response was 60% more common in mRECIST criteria evaluation. Our analysis confirms that reduction in viable tumor/enhancing area using contrast-enhanced radiologic imaging is the more optimal method to assess treatment response in HCC, and using RECIST 1.1 tumor measurement of a longest diameter as the sole measure of response, may not be adequate in response assessment for HCC. Our analysis validates and supports more widespread adoption of mRECIST in HCC tumor response assessment. Our results also indicate the need for uniform image acquisition and rigorous image quality control for a valid response in mRECIST criteria.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib, an inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, in Chinese pts with pretreated advanced HCC. Methods: In this randomized, placebocontrolled, double-blind, phase 3 trial done in 31 sites in China, pts with HCC who had received at least one line of systemic therapy (including sorafenib and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, which is another first-line standard-of-care in China) and had Child-Pugh liver function class A or B ≤7 points were enrolled. The pts were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive 750 mg apatinib orally once daily or placebo and stratified by ECOG performance status (0 or 1), previous sorafenib treatment (yes or no), and extrahepatic spread and/or macrovascular invasion (yes or no) in 28-day treatment cycles.

Mucocutaneous inflammation may cause HFS; therefore, we investigated whether celecoxib can alleviate HFS, improve patients' quality of life and increase survival when administered in conjunction with active therapy. Our randomized, open-label study prospectively enrolled 116 advanced HCC patients receiving sorafenib as targeted therapy from July 2015 to July 2016. All patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computer-generated sequence to receive sorafenib with or without celecoxib. Sorafenib-related AEs were recorded, Survival was compared between the two groups. Compared to the Sorafenib group, the SoraCele group had lower incidence rates of ≥ grade 2 and grade 3 HFS (63.8% vs 29.3%, P 0.001; 19.0% vs 3.4%, P = 0.008, respectively), hair loss, rash and abdominal pain. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a lower risk of ≥ grade 2 HFS (HR, 0.384; P = 0.002) and a lower dose reduction/interruption rate (46.6% to 15.5%, P 0.001) in the SoraCele group. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that celecoxib was the only independent predictive factor of developing ≥ grade 2 HFS (HR, 0.414; P = 0.004). Longer progression-free survival (PFS) was also observed in the SoraCele group (P = 0.039), although overall survival was not prolonged (P = 0.305).

Date of Publication: 2020","2020","48","SUPPL 1","34","35","2020","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as the most common primary liver cancer, is among leading causes of cancer- related death worldwide. It occurs mainly in the setting of chronic inflammatory liver diseases, thus making the treatment extremely complex. Forty percent of patients with HCC are diagnosed in advanced stage and are candidates for systemic treatment. The approval of multikinase inhibitor sorafenib in 2007 was followed by many unsuccessful phase III trials assessing novel targeted therapies and locoregional therapies, such as radioembolization, that did not fulfill the primary overall survival (OS) endpoints. From 2016 to 2018, five new drugs (lenvatinib in the first- line and regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the second- line treatment) showed clinical efficacy and have been adopted by guidelines, but durable responses with monotherapy are rarely seen. Liver, as the key immunologic organ, contains high proportion of various immune cell subtypes which play the role in HCC pathogenesis, making its phenotype immune evasive. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown modest efficacy as monotherapy in the first- and second- line treatment. Combination therapy for simultaneous inhibition of several immune checkpoints is currently being investigated. The CheckMate 040 trial (cohort 4) is investigating the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab at various doses and dose intervals. The Arm A regimen (four cycles of nivolumab at 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, followed by a 240-mg flat dose of nivolumab every 2 weeks) showed superior ORR (32%) and survival benefit (median OS 22.8 months) over two other investigational arms. A phase III HIMALAYA trial is currently investigating the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab against durvalumab or sorafenib alone, based on superior response rate versus durvalumab alone in the phase I trial. In recent years, combinations of ICIs and molecular agents targeting angiogenesis have shown great promise, based on the role of proangiogenic factors released by tumor cells and vascular endothelial cells in creating an immune-inhibitory microenvironment. Based on the improvement in ORR shown in a phase II study, first- line treatment with an anti- PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab was further investigated versus sorafenib in a phase III study (IMbrave150). The results were presented at ESMO Asia in 2019; median OS with the atezolizumab combination was not estimable (NE) compared to 13.2 months with sorafenib (HR 0.58; p = 0.0006). According to mRECIST criteria, the ORR was 33% versus 13% (p < 0.0001) in favor of combination. The authors concluded that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab has the potential to be a practice changing treatment in the first-line setting for patients with unresectable HCC. In a phase Ib study (Keynote- 524), lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab showed ORR of 53.3% which compared favorably with lenvatinib arm of registrational REFLECT trial (24.1%); disease control rate was 90.0%. The trial was expanded to the phase III (LEAP-002) in which this combination is being compared to lenvatinib alone. Many trials investigating combinations of immunotherapy and targeted agents (COSMIC- 312, SHR-1210-III-310, ORIENT-32) are ongoing, and it seems that more durable responses achieved by combining these agents may greatly change conventional treatment algorithms for HCC. Patients with intermediate- stage HCC are at high risk for recurence after locoregional treatment, and so far no adjuvant therapy has been proved effective. Recently published results of TACTICS trial showed PFS benefit of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus sorafenib versus TACE alone (25.2 vs 13.5 months; p=0.006), but no difference in overall survival. The promising treatment strategy for early- and intermediate- stage HCC is the combination of locoregional therapies and ICIs. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), TACE and radiotherapy can trigger the release of neoantigens and enhance the effects of immunotherapy (abscopal effect). Microsatellite lesions typically undetectable on imaging are the main cause of recurrence after curative therapy for HCC. When release of tumor antigen is induced by TACE or RFA, subsequent administration of an anti-PD-1 antibody may inhibit intrahepatic micrometastases. Several phase III trials investigating ICIs in the adjuvant treatment, alone or in combination with other strategies, such as antiangiogenic treatment or TACE (CheckMate 9DX, Keynote -937, EMERALD-2, EMERALD-1) are ongoing. Biliary tract cancers (BTC) are poor prognosis malignancies with limited treatment options. Capecitabine remains the standard of care in the adjuvant setting. Several trials (ACTICCA-1, AdBTC-1, JCOG1202, ASCOT) are currently investigating whether there is added clinical benefit of intensification of chemotherapy, antiangiogenic treatment or immunotherapy in resected BTC. Treatment of advanced disease is still limited to first-line cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. Recent global efforts in genomic profiling and molecular subtyping of BTCs have uncovered a wealth of genomic aberrations which may carry prognostic significance and/or predict response to treatment, and several targeted agents (IDH inhibitors, FGFR inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors, anti-HER2 directed therapies, NTRK- fusion directed agents) have shown promising results in clinical trials. Based on the results of a basket trial, in 2017 FDA approved ICIs for patients with MSI/dMMR tumors (including BTC) after progression on standard treatment options. Given the promising responses to immunotherapy thus far, there is a strong rationale for testing the combined checkpoint inhibition and combining ICIs with chemotherapy, as well as the adoptive immunotherapy. The uptake of comprehensive genomic profiling for patients with BTCs and the expansion of basket trials to include these patients are growing. However, a deeper understanding of potential resistance mechanisms and the complex crosstalk between molecular pathways is growing and combination strategies targeting more than one pathway are being proposed. In order to benefit from tailored therapy, genomic testing for all patients with BTC should be considered and liquid biopsy may be the most convenient way to implement this.",,,,L633439817,

Date of Publication: 2020","2020","105","SUPPL 2","S38",,"2020","Introduction: CAD is a rare autoimmune hemolytic anemia with an estimated prevalence of 16 per 1 million. Hemolysis is driven by activation of the classical complement pathway (CP), resulting in erythrocyte opsonization with predominant extravascular destruction and ensuing anemia. Patients with CAD have an increased early mortality and risk of thromboembolism. There are no approved treatments. Sutimlimab (formerly BIVV009) is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal anti-C1s antibody that selectively inhibits the C1 complex of complement, preventing CP activation, while leaving the alternative and lectin pathways intact. The objective of the Cardinal study (NCT03347396) is to assess efficacy and safety of sutimlimab in adults with CAD who have a recent history of transfusion. Methods: Cardinal is a pivotal Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of 26 weeks duration (Part A) with an ongoing extension (Part B). Data is available from Part A. Patients with confirmed diagnosis of CAD were enrolled. Eligibility criteria included baseline hemoglobin (Hb) ≤10 g/dL, total bilirubin level above normal, and ≥1 blood transfusion in the prior 6 months. Sutimlimab was administered intravenously on Days 0 and 7, followed by biweekly infusions. Patients weighing <75 kg or ≥75 kg received a 6.5 g or 7.5 g dose, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint was response rate based on a composite of Hb increase ≥2 g/dL or Hb ≥12 g/dL at treatment assessment (average from Weeks 23, 25, and 26) and transfusion avoidance from Weeks 5 to 26. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline in hemolytic markers (eg, bilirubin) and quality of life (QOL) measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F) Scale. The proportion of responders for analysis of the primary endpoint was calculated with a 95% exact Clopper-Pearson confidence interval (CI). All secondary endpoints were analyzed using descriptive statistics, frequency, percentage, or CIs. Results: Twenty-four patients enrolled and received ≥1 dose of sutimlimab. The mean (standard deviation) age was 71.3 (8.2) years with 62.5% females. Mean (range) baseline Hb was 8.6 (4.9a-11.1) g/dL. The median (range) number of transfusions within 6 months prior to enrollment was 2 (1a-19) and 62.5% of patients had failed prior therapies. Out of 24 patients, 22 completed Part A; 2 patients were withdrawn early for reasons unrelated to the study drug. The estimated mean (standard error [SE]) Hb increase at treatment assessment time point was 2.6 (0.4) g/dL. Hb improved rapidly after the first dose of sutimlimab with 1.2 g/dL and 2.3 g/dL increases by Weeks 1 and 3, respectively. Mean overall Hb was maintained above 11 g/dL after Week 3 (Figure 1A). Twenty (83.3%) patients had a mean Hb increase ≥1 g/dL. Mean total bilirubin was normalized by Week 3. Seventeen (70.8%) patients remained free of transfusions from Weeks 5 to 26. FACIT-F scores improved within 1 week, peaking by Week 5, and remained stable through Week 26. The estimated mean (SE) FACIT-F score increase at the treatment assessment time point was 10.9 (1.4), consistent with a clinically meaningful response. Hb, bilirubin, and FACIT-F improvements correlated with rapid normalization of complement C4 and near-complete inhibition of CP activity (Figure 1B). The prespecified primary endpoint was met (13 [54.2%] patients). Twenty-two (91.7%) patients experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), with 7 (29.2%) patients experiencing a serious TEAE (TESAE). There were no TESAEs assessed as related to sutimlimab. There was 1 death in a patient with hepatic cancer that was assessed as unrelated to the study drug. Serious infections were reported, but no meningococcal infections were identified. There were no thromboembolisms and decreases in mean D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin III complex thrombotic markers were observed. All 22 patients that completed Part A enrolled in Part B. Conclusions: The Phase 3 Cardinal study shows that sutimlimab, a first-in-class selective inhibitor of the CP, has a rapid and sustained treatment effect in CAD by preventing hemolysis, significantly increasing Hb, and improving QOL (FACIT-F). These results demonstrate that targeting the CP represents a novel, effective therapeutic approach for the management of CAD and indicate that sutimlimab has the potential to change treatment practices for patients with this condition.",,,,L633718699,

Materials and Methods: The HEAT study was a double-blind, randomized controlled phase III trial of RF ablation only versus RF ablation + LTLD in patients with HCCs 3–7 cm in diameter. Effect of BPV on progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) was analyzed. Results: BPV demonstrated statistically significant differences between study groups for OS (P =.038, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.85), but not for progression-free survival (P =.389, HR = 1.059). In a separate analysis, treatment groups were independently analyzed to determine the effect of BPV within each individual group. OS improved as BPV increased for patients receiving RF ablation + LTLD (P =.017, HR = 0.836, confidence interval [0.722, 0.968]). This same association was not observed in patients receiving RF ablation only (P =.57, HR = 0.99). Conclusions: BPV may be a useful metric for RF ablation + LTLD combination therapy for solitary HCC. The analysis suggested that the burn time for the tumor needs to be adjusted depending on the tumor volume. Because this is a post hoc study, the results are only suggestive and need to be confirmed with prospective studies.",,,31409568,L2002533898,10.1016/j.jvir.2019.04.023

Our increased understanding of the heterogeneous molecular pathogenesis of HCC has led to significant developments in novel targeted therapies. Despite these advances, there remains a high unmet need for new treatment options. HCC is a complex disease with multiple pathogenic mechanisms caused by a variety of risk factors, making it difficult to characterize with a single biomarker. In fact, numerous biomarkers have been studied in HCC, but alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) remains the most widely used and accepted serum marker since its discovery over 60 years ago. This review summarizes the most relevant studies associated with the regulation of AFP at the gene and protein levels; the pathophysiology of AFP as a pro-proliferative protein; and the correlation of AFP with molecular HCC subclasses, the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway and angiogenesis. Also described are the historical and current uses of AFP for screening and surveillance, diagnosis, its utility as a prognostic and predictive biomarker and its role as a tumour antigen in HCC. Taken together, these data demonstrate the relevance of AFP for patients with HCC and identify several remaining questions that will benefit from future research.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01140347)",,31436873,L2002833446,10.1111/liv.14223

We aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of cabozantinib for sorafenib-resistant HCC from the payer’s perspective of the USA, UK and China. Methods: We developed Markov models to simulate the patients pre-treated with first-line sorafenib following the CELESTIAL trial. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated for the treatment with cabozantinib or best supportive care. The list price for drugs was acquired from the Red Book, the British National Formulary, West China hospital and reported literature. Adverse events, utilities weights, and transition likelihood between states were sourced from the published randomized phase III trial. A willing-to-pay threshold was set $150 000/QALY in the USA, $70 671/QALY (£50 000/QALY) in the UK and $26 481/QALY (3x GDP per capita) in China. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were developed to test the models’ uncertainty. Results: In the base case, treatment with cabozantinib increased effectiveness by 0.13 QALYs, resulting in an ICER vs best supportive care of $833 497/QALY in the USA, $304 177/QALY in the UK and $156 437/QALY in China. The models were most sensitive to assumptions about transitions to progression with both cabozantinib and best supportive care, the utility associated with being progression free. These results were robust across a range of scenarios and sensitivity analyses, including deterministic and probabilistic analyses. Conclusions: Cabozantinib at its current cost would not be a cost-effective treatment option for patients with sorafenib-resistant HCC from the payer's perspective in the USA, UK or China.

In the Phase III CELESTIAL trial, hepatocellular carcinoma patients receiving cabozantinib showed longer overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) than those receiving placebo. The approved cabozantinib (Cabometyx(®)) dose is 60 mg once daily with allowable dose modifications to manage adverse events (AE). Time-to-event Cox proportional hazard exposure–response (ER) models were developed to characterize the relationship between predicted cabozantinib exposure and the likelihood of various efficacy and safety endpoints. The ER models were used to predict hazard ratios (HR) for efficacy and safety endpoints for starting doses of 60, 40, or 20 mg daily. Statistically significant relationships between cabozantinib exposure and efficacy and safety endpoints were observed. For efficacy endpoints, predicted HR were lower for OS and PFS at 40 and 60 mg relative to the 20 mg dose: HR for death (OS) are 0.84 (40 mg) and 0.70 (60 mg); HR for disease progression/death (PFS) are 0.73 (40 mg) and 0.62 (60 mg).

It is unknown if the sequencing of therapy of TKI and ICI makes a difference in response rate, nor if TKIs can be safely used in the third-line setting after ICI. Methods: Of 114 patients with advanced HCC treated with an ICI at our institution between 30 Dec 2013 and 13 Jun 2018, 59 who also received a TKI were retrospectively identified. Patients were classified into three categories: Group 1, those who had received TKI before an ICI (TKI1-ICI), Group 2 included those who received an ICI followed by an TKI (ICI-TKI2), and Group 3 included those who received a TKI both before and after ICI (TKI1-ICI-TKI2).

Patients were classified into three categories: Group 1, those who had received TKI before an ICI (TKI1-ICI), Group 2 included those who received an ICI followed by an TKI (ICI-TKI2), and Group 3 included those who received a TKI both before and after ICI (TKI1-ICI-TKI2). Response evaluation was done based on RECIST v1.1. Results: 28 patients received TKI1-ICI, 24 received ICI-TKI2, and 7 received TKI1-ICITKI2. Median OS was 12.1, 13.9, 31.2m in groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively (p=0.20), while PFS was 3.1, 2.1 and 3.7 m. (p=0.40) Response rate to TKI was 3.6%, 12.5% and 28.6% respectively for Group 1, 2 and 3 (p=0.10), and disease control rate was 21.4%, 25.0% and 71.4% respectively (p=0.04). 65.7% of the patients who received TKI before ICI experienced adverse events of any grade, similar to 61.3% of patients who received TKI after ICI. The rate of grade 3 or higher adverse events were also similar at 5.8% and 9.7%. There were no grade 5 adverse events. Conclusion: DCR with TKI was higher when sequenced after ICI and even higher when sequenced after both prior TKI and ICI, suggesting that there may be a role for defining the sequence or combination of TKI and ICI in patients with HCC. No new safety signals were seen with use of TKI following ICI.",,,,L630739590,10.1093/annonc/mdz449.018

Although sorafenib was used in clinical practice as the first molecular targeted agent in 2007, the SHARPE and Asian-Pacific trials demonstrated that sorafenib only improved overall survival (OS) by approximately 3 months in patients with advanced HCC compared with placebo. Molecular targeted agents were developed during the 10-year period from 2007 to 2016, but every test of these agents from phase II or phase III clinical trial failed due to a low response rate and high toxicity. In the 2 years after, 2017 through 2018, four successful novel drugs emerged from clinical trials for clinical use. As recommended by updated Barcelona Clinical Liver cancer (BCLC) treatment algorithms, lenvatinib is now feasible as an alternative to sorafenib as a first-line treatment for advanced HCC. Regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab are appropriate supplements for sorafenib as second-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC who are resistant, show progression or do not tolerate sorafenib. In addition, with promising outcomes in phase II trials, immune PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab have been applied for HCC treatment. Despite phase III trials for nivolumab and pembrolizumab, the primary endpoints of improved OS were not statistically significant, immune PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint therapy remains to be further investigated.

Obesity and diabetes are considered not only the main triggers for the development of the disease, but also two independent risk factors for HCC. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (such as PNPLA3, TM6SF2 and MBOAT7) are related to the susceptibility to the development of HCC and its progression. Therefore, an appropriate follow-up of these patients is needed for the early diagnosis and treatment of HCC. To date, international guidelines recommend the use of ultrasonography with or without alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in patients with advanced fibrosis. Furthermore, the use of non-invasive tools could represent a strategy to implement surveillance performance. In this review, we analyzed the main risk factors of NAFLD-related HCC, the validated screening methods and the future perspectives.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02306070, NCT02319200, NCT02466516, NCT02704403, NCT03028740)",,31717576,L2003238011,10.3390/ijms20225613

Covariate effects of cancer type including hepatocellular carcinoma population and liver dysfunction per the National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group criteria were evaluated (normal 1425; mild liver dysfunction 558; moderate/severe liver dysfunction 15/1 patients). With hepatocellular carcinoma patients, PK parameter estimates and covariate effects were similar to the previous PPK model (2 compartments with first- and zero-order absorption and first-order elimination). Only medullary thyroid cancer had appreciable PK differences from healthy volunteers. PK parameter estimates were similar with and without addition of liver dysfunction covariates. Patients with mild liver dysfunction were predicted to have minimal differences in apparent clearance of cabozantinib relative to patients with normal liver function. Therefore, no initial cabozantinib dosage adjustment is recommended for cancer patients with mild liver dysfunction. The small sample size for patients with moderate and severe liver dysfunction limited dosing recommendations in these subpopulations.

Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) can result in tumour down-staging, making patients eligible for treatments with curative intent (TCI). This study aimed to assess the implications of including down-staging in a PartSA of SIRT with Y-90 resin microspheres versus sorafenib in the UK. Targeted literature reviews were conducted to identify survival after resection and ablation (the most common TCIs after down-staging) and the proportion of patients down-staged after SIRT. A lifetime PartSA was developed based on a phase III trial (SARAH). Highly informative censoring (with only one TCI patient dying within follow-up period) resulted in the traditional PartSA approach excluding the mortality effect of TCIs, underestimating long-term efficacy. A second model structure including OS without downstaging from the trial and OS after subsequent TCIs from the literature was developed and compared with the traditional PartSA. Depending on the selectiveness of the population 5%-29% of patients received TCIs after SIRT in aHCC, while 13.5% and 2.1% received TCIs in the trial after SIRT and sorafenib, respectively. Five-year survival after TCIs in the UK was 40%-60% (from 21% including cirrhotic patients) vs. 50% in the model including down-staging. Discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for SIRT increased by 7% (1.98 from 1.85) with the explicit inclusion of down-staging, while total costs decreased by 6% (£31,146 to £29,143), leading to SIRT dominating sorafenib in the model explicitly including down-staging compared to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £4,322/QALY in the traditional PartSA.

This study assessed the cost-utility of SIRT with Y-90 resin microspheres versus sorafenib in UK patients with unresectable HCC ineligible for transarterial chemoemboliation (TACE). Methods: A lifetime partitioned survival model was developed. Patients start in ‘Pre-progression’ health state and can move monthly to ‘Down-staged to treatments with curative intent’, ‘Progressed’ and ‘Death’. Based on clinical guidelines, the base case population consisted of patients with low tumour burden (≤25%) and good liver function (ALBI grade 1), with wider populations assessed in scenario analyses. Efficacy data extrapolated using parametric survival models, grade 3/4 adverse events and treatment discontinuation were from a European phase III randomised controlled trial (SARAH). Survival after potentially curative treatments was estimated based on published studies. Utilities were mapped from EORTC-QLQ-C30 scores (SARAH trial). Resource use was based on registries and clinical surveys. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted, including assessment of structural uncertainty. Results: Discounted QALYs were 1.982 and 1.381, discounted total costs (2018/19) were £29,143 and £30,927 for SIRT and sorafenib respectively. With higher efficacy and lower costs, SIRT dominated sorafenib. The probability of SIRT being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000/QALY was 95%. SIRT remained cost-effective in all scenario analyses, including 20-40% reductions in the price of sorafenib. In the overall trial population, incremental costs and QALYs were -£6,142 and -0.105 for SIRT, leading to sorafenib not being cost-effective vs. SIRT (£58,763/QALY). The most influential inputs were the survival estimates and the proportion of patients down-staged to treatments with curative intent.

Objective: To determine if doxorubicin added to sorafenib therapy improves OS, with stratification for locally advanced and metastatic disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: This unblinded randomized phase 3 clinical trial was led by Alliance in collaboration with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network, Canadian Cancer Trials Group, and Southwest Oncology Group. It was launched in February 2010 and completed in May 2015; data were also analyzed during this time frame. Patients with histologically proven advanced HCC, no prior systemic therapy, Child-Pugh grade A score, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 (later amended to 0-1), and adequate hematologic, hepatic, renal, and cardiac function were eligible. The OS primary end point had a final analysis planned with 364 events observed among 480 total patients with 90% power to detect a 37% increase in median OS. Interventions or Exposures: Patients received either 60 mg/m(2) of doxorubicin every 21 days plus 400 mg of sorafenib orally twice daily or the sorafenib alone, adjusted to half doses for patients with bilirubin levels of 1.3 to 3.0 mg/dL. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was OS, and progression-free survival (PFS) was a secondary end point. Results: Of 356 patients included in the study, the mean (SD) age was 62 (10.1) years, and 306 (86.0%) were men.

Hemolysis is driven by activation of the classical complement pathway (CP), resulting in erythrocyte opsonization with predominant extravascular destruction and ensuing anemia. Patients with CAD have an increased early mortality and risk of thromboembolism. There are no approved treatments. Sutimlimab (formerly BIVV009) is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal anti-C1s antibody that selectively inhibits the C1 complex of complement, preventing CP activation, while leaving the alternative and lectin pathways intact.

Methods Cardinal is a pivotal Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of 26 weeks' duration (Part A) with an ongoing extension (Part B). Data is available from Part A. Patients with confirmed diagnosis of CAD were enrolled. Eligibility criteria included baseline hemoglobin (Hb) ≤10 g/dL, total bilirubin level above normal, and ≥1 blood transfusion in the prior 6 months. Sutimlimab was administered intravenously on Days 0 and 7, followed by biweekly infusions. Patients weighing <75 kg or ≥75 kg received a 6.5 g or 7.5 g dose, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint was response rate based on a composite of Hb increase ≥2 g/dL or Hb ≥12 g/dL at treatment assessment (average from Weeks 23, 25, and 26) and transfusion avoidance from Weeks 5 to 26. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline in hemolytic markers (eg, bilirubin) and quality of life (QOL) measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F) Scale.

All secondary endpoints were analyzed using descriptive statistics, frequency, percentage, or CIs. Results Twenty-four patients enrolled and received ≥1 dose of sutimlimab. The mean (standard deviation) age was 71.3 (8.2) years with 62.5% females. Mean (range) baseline Hb was 8.6 (4.9-11.1) g/dL. The median (range) number of transfusions within 6 months prior to enrollment was 2 (1-19) and 62.5% of patients had failed prior therapies. Out of 24 patients, 22 completed Part A; 2 patients were withdrawn early for reasons unrelated to the study drug. The estimated mean (standard error [SE]) Hb increase at treatment assessment time point was 2.6 (0.4) g/dL. Hb improved rapidly after the first dose of sutimlimab with 1.2 g/dL and 2.3 g/dL increases by Weeks 1 and 3, respectively. Mean overall Hb was maintained above 11 g/dL after Week 3 (Figure 1A). Twenty (83.3%) patients had a mean Hb increase ≥1 g/dL. Mean total bilirubin was normalized by Week 3. Seventeen (70.8%) patients remained free of transfusions from Weeks 5 to 26. FACIT-F scores improved within 1 week, peaking by Week 5, and remained stable through Week 26. The estimated mean (SE) FACIT-F score increase at the treatment assessment time point was 10.9 (1.4), consistent with a clinically meaningful response. Hb, bilirubin, and FACIT-F improvements correlated with rapid normalization of complement C4 and near-complete inhibition of CP activity (Figure 1B). The prespecified primary endpoint was met (13 [54.2%] patients). Twenty-two (91.7%) patients experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), with 7 (29.2%) patients experiencing a serious TEAE (TESAE). There were no TESAEs assessed as related to sutimlimab. There was 1 death in a patient with hepatic cancer that was assessed as unrelated to the study drug. Serious infections were reported, but no meningococcal infections were identified. There were no thromboembolisms and decreases in mean D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin III complex thrombotic markers were observed. All 22 patients that completed Part A enrolled in Part B. Conclusions The Phase 3 Cardinal study shows that sutimlimab, a first-in-class selective inhibitor of the CP, has a rapid and sustained treatment effect in CAD by preventing hemolysis, significantly increasing Hb, and improving QOL (FACIT-F). These results demonstrate that targeting the CP represents a novel, effective therapeutic approach for the management of CAD and indicate that sutimlimab has the potential to change treatment practices for patients with this condition.",,,,L630752795,10.1182/blood-2019-132490

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2019","2019","105","6","36",,"1 Nov 2019","Background: REACH-2 demonstrated a significant survival benefit with RAM vs placebo in the second-line treatment of patients with advanced HCC and AFP ≥400 ng/mL. This analysis investigated changes in AFP during treatment, as well as potential relationships with survival or progression. Material and methods: Patients were randomized (2:1) to RAM 8 mg/kg IV or placebo Q2W plus best supportive care until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Serum AFP levels were measured at baseline and every 3 cycles. Percent change in AFP from baseline was analyzed at each time point up to Cycle 12 with descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon rank sum test between treatment arms. AFP response was defined as ≥20% decrease from baseline. The association between AFP progression and radiographic progression in each time interval was assessed by odds ratio (OR) and Fisher's exact test. Time to AFP progression and time to radiographic progression (TTP) were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between treatment arms using a stratified log-rank test. AFP progression was defined as ≥20% increase from baseline. Hazard ratio (HR) was generated using a stratified Cox regression model. Results: AFP response was significantly higher with RAM compared with placebo (42.1% vs 10.5%, p<0.0001). Overall survival (OS) was longer in patients with AFP response (13.5 months) than in patients without (6.7 months), irrespective of treatment (HR 0.470, p<0.0001). The median percent increase in AFP level from baseline was smaller in the patient population treated with RAM (0.4%, 6.1%, 15.4%, 10.8%) than with placebo (45.7%, 98.5%, 122.2%, 91.3%) at Cycles 3, 6, 9 and 12, respectively. Time to AFP progression (HR 0.422, p<0.0001) and TTP (HR 0.427, p<0.0001) favored a RAM benefit; subsequent analyses demonstrated a strong association between AFP progression and radiographic progression at 6 weeks (OR 2.44, p<0.0084) and at 12 weeks (OR 1.89, p = 0.0430). Conclusions: Changes in AFP levels were associated with TTP and OS. RAM prolonged both time to AFP progression and radiographic TTP, and appeared to slow the rate of AFP increase during treatment.",,,,L633496059,10.1177/0300891619872589

Cabozantinib is approved in the United States and Europe for treatment of aHCC after prior sorafenib based on improved overall survival (OS) and progressionfree survival (PFS) versus placebo in the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial (Abou-Alfa NEJM 2018). Cabozantinib may promote an immune-permissive tumor environment, which could enhance response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Cabozantinib in combination with the anti-PDL1 antibody atezolizumab is being evaluated in multiple tumor types including HCC in a phase 1 study; recommended dose, preliminary clinical activity, and safety of the combination have been demonstrated in aRCC (Agarwal Ann Oncol 2018). Atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody, has shown preliminary clinical activity in first-line aHCC (Pishvaian Ann Oncol 2018). Here, we present the study design of a phase 3 trial of cabozantinib + atezolizumab versus sorafenib in patients with aHCC who have not received prior systemic therapy. Patients and methods: This global, randomized, openlabel phase 3 trial (NCT03755791) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of cabozantinib + atezolizumab versus sorafenib as first-line treatment for aHCC. Eligibility criteria include age ≥18 years, BCLC stage B or C, Child-Pugh A, ECOG PS ≤1, and measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. Patients are randomized 2:1:1 to an experimental arm of cabozantinib (40 mg qd) + atezolizumab (1200 mg infusion q3w), a control arm of sorafenib (400 mg bid), and a cabozantinib monotherapy arm (60 mg qd). 740 patients are planned to be enrolled at ~250 sites globally. Randomization is stratified by disease etiology (HBV [with or without HCV], HCV [without HBV], or other), region (Asia, other), and the presence of extrahepatic disease and/or macrovascular invasion (yes, no). PFS and OS for cabozantinib + atezolizumab versus sorafenib are primary endpoints, and PFS for cabozantinib versus sorafenib is a secondary endpoint. Additional endpoints include safety, pharmacokinetics, and correlation of biomarker analyses with clinical outcomes.

Here, we evaluate outcomes based on plasma biomarkers in CELESTIAL. Methods: A total of 707 patients (pts) were randomised 2:1 to receive C (60 mg qd) or P. Pts were Child-Pugh A and ECOG PS ≤1, must have received prior sorafenib, and could have received up to 2 prior systemic regimens for HCC. Plasma samples were collected at baseline and on treatment for 674 pts and analysed by Luminex assay (Assay Gate, Ijamsville, MD). OS and PFS were evaluated for low and high baseline biomarker levels dichotomised at the median. Prognostic factors were identified by comparing low vs high biomarker levelswithin each treatment arm, using the criterion that the HR 95% CI does not include 1.0. Biomarkers were considered predictive if P ≤ .05 for the interaction between treatment and subgroup. Results: For low and high levels of all 13 biomarkers analysed, hazard ratios favoured Cover P for both OS and PFS (allCvs P HRs <0.55; not shown). Analyses comparing low versus high biomarker levels identified MET, AXL, HGF, GAS6, VEGF-A, ANG2, IL-8, IGF-1, and EPO as possible prognostic factors for OS in one or both treatment arms. No baseline biomarkers were found to be predictive of an OS benefit with C (p interaction >0.05). Conclusion: C treatment was associated with improved OS and PFS versus P in previously treated aHCCirrespective of baseline biomarker levels.

Possible applications include the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Unfortunately, new immune-related adverse effects have been associated with the use of these agents and the liver is one of the organs most frequently involved. Aims: To provide a general overview of the potential impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors on the liver. Methods: We reviewed the literature and abstracts/presentations on immune checkpoint inhibitors at most relevant hepatology meetings over the last 5 years. Results: The role of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been investigated both for the treatment of viral hepatitis and primary liver cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic hepatitis B show the greatest potential for treatment with these drugs in the near future. However, immune-related adverse events involving the liver are a growing concern related to their widespread use. Conclusions: Immune checkpoint inhibitors represent an exciting new class of drugs with currently limited application in malignant and non-malignant liver disease. Caution must be exercised on the emergence of potentially severe immune adverse reactions.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02393248, NCT02465060, NCT02576509, NCT02628067, NCT02702401, NCT02703714, NCT02821754, NCT02829918, NCT02834013, NCT02866383, NCT03046862, NCT03062358, NCT03101566, NCT03110328, NCT03111732, NCT03250273, NCT03260712, NCT03298451, NCT03311789, NCT03383458, NCT03412773, NCT03434379, NCT03473574, NCT03482102, NCT03639935, NCT03684811, NCT03713593, NCT03755791, NCT03768531, NCT03778957, NCT03785873, NCT03797326)",,31378985,L2002374237,10.1111/apt.15449

The purpose of this IRB approved study is to describe long-term outcomes of patients with HCC and MVI treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Materials and Methods: Patients with HCC and MVI who were treated with SBRT from January 2003 to December 2016 were eligible for analysis. Patients who had extrahepatic disease, had a previous liver transplant, or were treated with palliative intent were excluded. Demographical, clinical, and treatment variables were collected, under IRB approval. The degree of vascular invasion was quantified into two categories: mainportal vein branch/IVC and distal portal/hepatic vein. Results: One hundred and twenty-eight eligible patients with HCC and MVI were treatedwith SBRT. The median age was 61 years (39 to 90 years). Underlying liver disease was hepatitis B in 23%, hepatitis C in 45%. Baseline Child-Pugh (CP) score was A5 in 67%, A6 in 20%, B7 or higher in 13%. Thirty-five percent received previous liver-directed therapies. Median gross tumour volume (GTV) was 153.7mL (range: 3.9 to 1,813.5 mL). Median AFP was 205ug/L (range 1 to 171,154). Median SBRT dose was 33.3Gy (range: 27 to 54 Gy) in 6 fractions. Local control at one year was 82.4% (95% CI 72.8 to 88.8%); SBRT dose, GTV volume, or treatment era were not statistically significant on univariate analysis. Median overall survival (OS) was 18.3 months (95% CI 11.2 to 21.4 months) for which baseline ECOG PS >1 (HR:1.73, p=0.02), baseline CP score (HR: 1.66, p=0.03), and treatment between 2003 and 2010 (HR: 2.28, p=0.0009) were significant on multivariate analysis; SBRT dose, GTV volume, and degree of vascular invasion were not statistically significant for survival. In 35 patients who received sorafenib following SBRT, median survival was 38.5 months (95% CI 17.23 to 43.16 months). Regarding toxicity, five patients developed GI bleeding and from 112 patients with liver function evaluable at baseline and three months, 27 patients experienced a deterioration of their CP class. Conclusions: SBRT was associatedwith excellent outcomes for patients with HCC and MVI, compared to historical controls treated with Sorafenib alone.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","30",,"vi53",,"1 Oct 2019","Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is a treatment modality that provides direct delivery of highly concentrated anticancer drugs into tumour-feeding vessels using an intraarterial catheter technique and decreases the systemic distribution through the first-pass effect of the liver. Therefore, HAIC is expected to have strong anticancer effects and mild toxicity, and it has been used mainly for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with macrovascular invasion. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of HAIC even after sorafenib (SOR) became a standard treatment for advanced HCC following the result of a phase III study: however, the results were not consistent with each other because of different patients and different treatment regimens. Moreover, no phase III trial was conducted to detect the efficacy of HAIC compared to that of SOR. Based on the results, HAIC could not become a standard treatment for patients with advanced HCC. As a perspective of HAIC, combination treatment containing tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as SOR or lenvatinib (LEN) may be an area to develop. Although LEN has shown non-inferiority to sorafenib in terms of survival, both SOR and LEN have several toxicities. Therefore, SOR and LEN are difficult to combine with other treatments, whereas HAIC could be a candidate because of its mild toxicity. Two prospective randomised trials that evaluated the efficacy of SOR and HAIC combination therapy showed promising results, and a phase III study that tests the efficacy of TKIs and HAIC combination therapy is warranted. Another aspect regarding HAIC to develop may be the treatment for patients with Child-Pugh class B/C disease. Several new chemotherapeutic agents have been developed; however, these treatments, including SOR and LEN, are only intended for patients with Child-Pugh class A disease.

"Prognostic and predictive factors from the phase III CELESTIAL trial of cabozantinib (C) versus placebo (P) in previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC)","Meyer T., Kelley R.K., Mangeshkar M., Cheng A.-L., El-Khoueiry A.B., Abou-Alfa G.K.","Annals of Oncology (2019) 30 Supplement 5 (v287-v288). Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","30",,"v287","v288","1 Oct 2019","Background: C improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) vs P in the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial (NCT01908426). Median OS was 10.2 mo with C vs 8.0 mo with P (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63–0.92; p = 0.005), and median PFS was 5.2 mo vs 1.9 mo (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.36–0.52; p < 0.001) (Abou-Alfa, NEJM 2018). Here, retrospective univariate (UV) and multivariate (MV) analyses were done to identify prognostic and predictive factors for OS from CELESTIAL. Methods: 707 patients (pts) were randomized 2:1 to receive C (60 mg qd) or P. Pts were Child-Pugh grade A and ECOG PS ≤ 1 and must have received prior sorafenib and could have received up to 2 prior lines of systemic therapy for HCC. UV and MV analyses of OS were done using the Cox proportional hazard regression model to compare subgroups defined by baseline variables within each treatment group (Bruix, J Hepatol 2017). MV analyses used backward selection with cutoffs of p ≤ 0.1 for inclusion and p ≤ 0.05 for retention of prognostic factors in the final model. Variables with p ≤ 0.05 for treatment-subgroup interaction were considered possible predictive factors for treatment benefit. Results: Age, sex, race, region, and etiology were not significant covariates in stepwise UV and MV analyses of OS. Nine baseline variables related to disease status, laboratory values, or prior therapy were identified as possible prognostic factors for OS in one or both treatment groups (Table). No covariates were found to be predictive of an OS benefit with C. Conclusions: Exploratory UV and MV analyses identified high baseline values of AFP, alkaline phosphatase, ALBI grade, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and number of disease sites as possible prognostic factors for shorter OS in previously treated aHCC. Disease etiology and demographic factors such as race and region were not found to be prognostic for OS. [Table presented] Clinical trial identification: NCT01908426.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","30",,"v290",,"1 Oct 2019","Background: CELESTIAL (NCT01908426), a phase 3 study in patients with aHCC who progressed on sorafenib (≤2 previous systemic treatments allowed), demonstrated improved survival and progression-free survival with cabozantinib over placebo. CELESTIAL was stopped early for benefit at the second interim analysis (hazard ratio for death in overall population, 0.76 [95% confidence interval 0.63–0.92; p = 0.005] resulting in short follow-up for some patients). This retrospective analysis compared patient experience of three discrete health states in patients receiving second-line cabozantinib vs placebo in CELESTIAL: time with grade 3/4 toxicity before progression (TOX); time without grade 3/4 toxicity before progression (TWiST); and survival time after progression or relapse (REL). Methods: Overall, 495 patients in CELESTIAL had sorafenib as the only prior therapy (cabozantinib, 331; placebo, 164). For each patient, times spent in TOX, TWiST and REL were calculated. Toxicities were based on reported adverse events. Patients censored prior to progression or death (32%) accrued time in each health state up to that date. Results: Second-line cabozantinib was associated with significantly longer mean TOX (49.8 vs 9.8 days, p < 0.0001), and also TWiST (110.9 vs 78.1 days, p = 0.001) than placebo; survival times after progression (REL) were similar; (Table). Analyses based on all patients in CELESTIAL (N = 707) or limited to those with ≥100 days of follow-up (regardless of whether they had a progression event prior to that time) resulted in numerically different estimates for each health state, but no qualitative differences in findings. Conclusions: Patients with aHCC receiving second-line cabozantinib after sorafenib spent significantly more time without disease symptoms and toxicity than those receiving placebo, despite an increase in days with grade 3/4 toxicity before progression.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","30",,"v291",,"1 Oct 2019","Background: A decrease in AFP level during treatment has been associated with improved overall survival (OS) in patients with HCC. In the phase 3 RESORCE trial (NCT01774344), the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib significantly improved OS versus placebo in patients with HCC and disease progression on sorafenib. We analyzed OS in patients who had an AFP response in RESORCE. Methods: Patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C HCC, Child -Pugh A liver function, ECOG performance status 0 − 1, and documented radiologic progression on prior sorafenib were randomized 2:1 to regorafenib 160 mg/day (n = 379) or placebo (n = 194) for Weeks 1-3 of each 4-week cycle. Serum AFP levels were assessed at baseline, every 4 weeks during treatment, and at the end of treatment. Patients who had a baseline AFP ≥20 ng/mL and an AFP measurement at the start of Cycle 3 were evaluable for AFP response, defined as a decrease of ≥ 20% in AFP level from baseline at the start of Cycle 3. Results: Overall, 232 of the 573 randomized patients fulfilled the above criteria and were included in the analysis. Patients with an AFP response had a median OS from randomization of 13.8 months vs 8.9 months in those without an AFP response (Table). The rate of AFP response was 46% (77/168) in the regorafenib group and 11% (7/64) in the placebo group. Among regorafenib-treated patients, the median OS was 13.8 months in patients with an AFP response vs 9.8 months in those without an AFP response. A landmark analysis of OS from the start of Cycle 3 showed that the hazard ratios for AFP response vs no response were 0.57 (95% CI 0.40, 0.82) in the regorafenib and placebo arms combined and 0.72 (95% CI 0.48, 1.08) for patients in the regorafenib arm. [Table presented] Conclusions: In this exploratory analysis of RESORCE, an AFP response with regorafenib was associated with improved OS. Clinical trial identification: NCT01774344.

"Overall survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving sorafenib versus selective internal radiation therapy with predicted osimetry in the SARAH trial","Hawkins N.S., Ross P.J., Palmer D.H., Chatellier G., Pereira H., Vilgrain V.","Annals of Oncology (2019) 30 Supplement 5 (v282). Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","30",,"v282",,"1 Oct 2019","Background: Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) using yttrium-90 resin microspheres was compared to sorafenib 400mg bid in a phase 3 randomised trial (SARAH) in the treatment of intermediate or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not amenable to curative treatment. The trial did not show a survival benefit of SIRT over sorafenib in the intention to treat (ITT) population. The effectiveness of SIRT may depend on the tumour-absorbed dose, which can be predicted with the analysis of SPECT/CT imaging during each patient work-up, before the administration of SIRT. In this post hoc analysis we explored the comparative effectiveness of SIRT and sorafenib in a subgroup of patients defined by their predicted tumour-absorbed dose. Methods: Cox proportional hazards regressions were conducted in the ITT population of the SARAH trial. Since predicted tumour-absorbed dose was only available for SIRT, the comparisons between SIRT at a given dose and sorafenib were not randomised. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using propensity scores was used to account for potential confounding by differences in prognostic factors between the treatment arms, with the sorafenib sample reweighted to match the SIRT patients. A cut-off value of 100 Gy was used for tumour absorbed dose, approximating the median dose, with 120 Gy used in a sensitivity analysis. Results: For patients with a predicted dose ≥100 Gy, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) from the unweighted sample was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.50-0.98, p = 0.04). After reweighting, the HR was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.51-1.04, p = 0.09). Predicted mean OS was 22.5 months (mos) for SIRT vs 17.9 mos for sorafenib. Results were similar with a 120 Gy cut-off: the HR for OS was 0.76 (95% CI 0.52-1.10, p = 0.14). Among patients who received subsequent curative therapy post-SIRT, 11/12 were alive at the end of follow-up (median 26.6 mos, range 16.0-34.8) and only one had a predicted dose <100 Gy. Conclusions: The analysis suggests that HCC patients may derive a meaningful benefit from treatment using SIRT with a predicted dose ≥100 Gy compared to sorafenib. This may inform personalised treatment selection and clinical trial design. Clinical trial identification: NCT01482442. Legal entity responsible for the study: Sirtex Medical UK Ltd.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","30",,"v289","v290","1 Oct 2019","Background: Elevated AFP in patients (pts) with HCC is associated with worse prognosis. Two placebo (P)-controlled trials (REACH, REACH-2) have studied ramucirumab (RAM, anti-VEGFR2 antibody) in pts with HCC after sorafenib, with REACH-2 enrolling only pts with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL. In REACH-2 RAM treatment (trt) improved overall survival (OS) compared to P, consistent with REACH (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) pts. Here we present post-hoc analyses assessing the prognostic and predictive value of baseline AFP in both studies. Methods: Pts with HCC, Child-Pugh A, ECOG PS 0-1, and prior sorafenib were randomized to RAM 8 mg/kg or P Q2W. The prognostic value of baseline AFP was assessed by Cox regression models with either continuous or dichotomous (≥400 vs < 400 ng/ml) AFP (REACH, N = 565), and confirmed using Cox model with continuous AFP ≥400 ng/mL (REACH-2, N = 292). Cox model with AFP and its trt interaction assessed the predictive value of baseline AFP in REACH. Subpopulation trt effect pattern plot (STEPP) assessed the interaction between RAM trt and AFP in REACH, REACH-2 and pooled individual pt data analysis of both studies (AFP ≥400 mg/mL). Results: Baseline AFP was confirmed as a significant continuous (REACH and REACH-2; p<.0001) and dichotomous (REACH; p<.01) prognostic factor for OS. AFP remained the predominant prognostic factor after adjusting for other significant prognostic factors, including macrovascular invasion and ECOG PS. The interaction between AFP and trt effect was significant in REACH (p=.0042 continuous; p<.0001 dichotomous), suggesting the predictive value of AFP in RAM OS benefit. Based on Cox regression of OS on continuous AFP level and its interaction with trt, the estimated OS hazard ratio in REACH (<0.8, 95% CI below 1) was significant at each AFP value ≥400 ng/mL, supporting AFP ≥400 ng/mL as selection criterion for RAM OS benefit. STEPP supported these results with OS benefits at each AFP value ≥400 ng/mL. Conclusions: The prognostic impact of baseline AFP is an important factor to consider in trial design. The findings suggest AFP may be predictive of RAM OS benefit. Results also confirm AFP ≥400 ng/mL is appropriate selection criterion for RAM OS benefit.

"The efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria of the phase III trial (REFLECT trial) and those with BCLC Stage B hepatocellular carcinoma: A nationwide multicenter study in Japan","Sakamoto A., Kurosaki M., Tsuchiya K., Abe T., Ogawa C., Soda T., Kimura H., Kondo M., Tsuji K., Koichiro F., Shigeno M., Jyoko K., Narita R., Uchida Y., Yoshida H., Akahane T., Kobashi H., Mitsuda A., Marusawa H., Izumi N.","Annals of Oncology (2019) 30 Supplement 5 (v289). Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","30",,"v289",,"1 Oct 2019","Background: The efficacy and safety of lenvatinib (LEN) are unknown in cases that were excluded in the phase III trial (REFLECT trial) of LEN, including those who experienced tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) before LEN. In addition, no evidence has been established for early introduction of molecular targeted therapy in BCLC stage B patients. Therefore, we verified the efficacy and safety in the patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria of REFLECT trial and those who were BCLC Stage B. Methods: A total of 203 patients received LEN from March 2018 to January 2019 at 21 sites in Japanese Red Cross Study Liver Group were registered. 128 cases out of REFLECT trial criteria and 74 cases of BCLC Stage B were retrospectively investigated. Tumors assessments in accordance with modified RECIST were done using dynamic CT and/or MRI. Results: 128 of 203 (63%) patients did not meet the inclusion criteria of the REFLECT trial. These cases included 69 receiving TKI therapy before LEN. The ORR and DCR in TKI naïve were 45% and 84%, respectively, and were 29% and 81% in TKI experienced (p = 0.072, p = 0.671). The OS between TKI naïve and experienced patients was not significantly different (p = 0.618), even though baseline albumin level and ALBI score were significantly lower in TKI experienced patients than TKI naïve (p = 0.001 and 0.005). 74 cases of BCLC Stage B included 57 with TACE history, 8 without, and 9 cases unknown. Although there was no difference between two groups in the baseline Child-Pugh score, ALBI score and AFP value, patients with TACE less than 6 times (n = 53) before LEN was significantly better in OS than those with TACE of 6 times or more (n = 12) (p = 0.025). Conclusions: Also in TKI experienced which was excluded from the REFLECT trial, ORR, DCR and OS did not differ from TKI naïve, and LEN may be useful as TKI 2nd line and 3rd line. In BCLC Stage B patients, TACE group less than 6 times has a better prognosis after LEN treatment compared with group more than 6 times, and an early introduction of LEN for multiple TACE cases may contribute to life prognosis improvement is there.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","30",,"v257","v258","1 Oct 2019","Background: C inhibits tyrosine kinases implicated in HCC progression and resistance to antiangiogenic therapy, including VEGFR, MET, and AXL. In the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial (NCT01908426), C significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) vs P in previously treated aHCC (Abou-Alfa, NEJM 2018). Here, we evaluate outcomes based on plasma biomarkers in CELESTIAL. Methods: 707 patients (pts) were randomized 2:1 to receive C (60 mg qd) or P. Pts were Child-Pugh A and ECOG PS ≤ 1, must have received prior sorafenib, and could have received up to 2 prior systemic regimens for HCC. Plasma samples were collected at baseline and on treatment for 674 pts and analyzed by Luminex assay (Assay Gate) for MET, AXL, VEGFR2, c-KIT, HGF, GAS6, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, PlGF, ANG2, IL-8, IGF-1, and EPO. OS and PFS were evaluated for low and high baseline biomarker levels dichotomized at the median. Prognostic factors were identified by comparing high vs low biomarker levels within each treatment arm, using the criterion that the HR 95% CI does not include 1.0. Biomarkers were considered predictive if p ≤ 0.05 for the interaction between treatment and subgroup. Results: For low and high levels of all 13 biomarkers analyzed, hazard ratios favored C over P for both OS (Table) and PFS (all C vs P HRs<0.55; not shown). Analyses comparing high vs low biomarker levels identified MET, HGF, GAS6, ANG2, IL-8, and IGF-1 as possible prognostic factors for OS in both treatment arms; VEGF-A in the P arm only; and AXL and EPO in the C arm only (Table). No baseline biomarkers were found to be predictive of an OS benefit with C (p interaction >0.05). Conclusions: C treatment was associated with improved OS and PFS vs P in previously treated aHCC irrespective of baseline biomarker levels. Low baseline levels of MET, HGF, GAS6, VEGF-A, ANG2, and IL-8 and high levels of IGF-1 were identified as potential prognostic biomarkers for longer OS with P.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","30",,"v292",,"1 Oct 2019","Background: REACH (NCT01140347) and REACH-2 (NCT02435433) were two global, randomized, double-blind, placebo (PL)-controlled multicenter, phase 3 studies of RAM vs PL in patients with HCC after prior sorafenib. REACH-2 confirmed overall survival (OS) benefit of RAM for patients with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL, consistent with results in a prespecified subgroup of patients in REACH with AFP ≥400 ng/mL. Methods: Post-hoc pooled analyses were performed to examine efficacy and safety in three age subgroups (<65, ≥65-<75, ≥75 years). In pooled population of patients from REACH (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) and REACH-2, Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression were performed for OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and deterioration of FHSI-8 total score by three points or more. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) is also reported by age subgroups. Results: Both intention-to-treat populations were pooled (542 patients in total). Within each age subgroup, baseline characteristics between treatment arms were similar. Patients of < 65 years showed a higher incidence of hepatitis B, extrahepatic spread, and a higher AFP level when compared with patients in older age subgroups across treatment arms. Efficacy outcomes are summarized in the table. Safety profiles of RAM were comparable between <65 and ≥65-<75 age subgroups. The incidence of ≥Grade 3 treatment-emergent AEs was higher in RAM arm than PL arm in ≥ 75 age subgroup (e.g. hypertension and fatigue). A trend toward a delay in the deterioration of symptoms in FHSI-8 for RAM arm was observed in all age subgroups. Conclusions: Efficacy and safety profiles of RAM observed in each age subgroup were consistent with those in the entire population. This exploratory subgroup analysis supports the use of RAM for the treatment of HCC with elevated AFP, irrespective of age.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","30",,"v320",,"1 Oct 2019","Background: C inhibits tyrosine kinases involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immune regulation, including MET, VEGFR, and TAM kinases (Tyro3, AXL, MER). C is approved in the United States and Europe for treatment of aHCC after prior S based on improved overall survival (OS) vs placebo in the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial (Abou-Alfa NEJM 2018). C may promote an immune-permissive tumor environment, which could enhance response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. C is being evaluated in combination with the anti-PD-L1 antibody A in multiple tumor types including HCC in a phase 1 study; recommended dose, preliminary clinical activity, and safety of the combination have been established in aRCC (Agarwal Ann Oncol 2018). A in combination with bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody, has shown preliminary clinical activity in first-line aHCC (Pishvaian Ann Oncol 2018). Here, we present the study design of a phase 3 trial of C + A vs S in pts with aHCC who have not received prior systemic therapy. Trial design: This global, randomized, open-label phase 3 trial (NCT03755791) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of C + A vs S as first-line treatment for aHCC. C vs S will also be evaluated as a secondary endpoint. Eligibility criteria include age ≥18 years, BCLC stage B or C, Child-Pugh A, ECOG PS ≤ 1, and measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. Pts are randomized 2:1:1 to an experimental arm of C (40 mg qd) + A (1200 mg infusion q3w), a control arm of S (400 mg bid), and a C monotherapy arm (60 mg qd). 740 pts are planned to be enrolled at ∼250 sites globally. Randomization is stratified by disease etiology (HBV [with or without HCV], HCV [without HBV], or other), region (Asia, other), and the presence of extrahepatic disease and/or macrovascular invasion (yes, no). OS and progression-free survival (PFS) for C+A vs S are primary endpoints, and PFS for C vs S is a secondary endpoint. Additional endpoints include safety, pharmacokinetics, and correlation of biomarker analyses with clinical outcomes. The first patient was enrolled in December 2018, and enrollment is ongoing.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","30",,"v256",,"1 Oct 2019","Background: KEYNOTE-240 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02702401) is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial that evaluated pembro 200 mg every 3 weeks compared with BSC in pts with advanced HCC who were previously systemically treated. Pembro reduced the risk of death by 22% and improved progression-free survival over BSC in pts with advanced HCC, although significance was not reached per prespecified statistical criteria. Here we present the results of prespecified exploratory HRQoL analyses. Methods: The EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-HCC18 questionnaires were administered electronically at baseline; weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18; every 9 weeks thereafter up to 1 year or end of treatment; and at the 30-day safety follow-up visit. Least squares mean (LSM) score changes from baseline to week 12 (prespecified) were compared using constrained longitudinal data analysis model including treatment by study visit interaction and stratification factors as covariates. Time to deterioration (TTD) (≥10-point decline from baseline) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method, and the magnitude of the treatment difference (hazard ratio) between treatment arms was assessed by a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Pts receiving ≥1 dose of study treatment and completing ≥1 HRQoL assessment were included in the analysis. The HRQoL population included 398 pts (271 pembro; 127 BSC). HRQoL compliance at week 12 was 90.0% for pembro and 89.3% for BSC. From baseline to week 12, there was no statistically significant difference in LSM between the 2 arms for global health status (GHS)/QoL score (-1.19; 95% CI, -5.35, 2.97; P = 0.573). The GHS/QOL scores remained stable over time for both arms. TTD for prespecified symptoms of abdominal swelling (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.76, 1.54; P = 0.6552), fatigue (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.71, 1.20; P = 0.2795), and pain (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.74, 1.27; P = 0.4078) from EORTC QLQ-HCC18 were similar between the 2 arms. Conclusions: Over 12 weeks, pts treated with pembro had similar HRQoL compared to pts receiving BSC. Along with efficacy and safety results from KN240, these data support the benefit of pembrolizumab in HCC pts. Clinical trial identification: NCT02702401; Release date: March 8, 2016.

This phase III study compared clinical efficacy and safety of NIVO with SOR as 1L therapy in pts with aHCC. Methods: Systemic therapy–naive pts aged ≥18 years with aHCC were randomized 1:1 to NIVO (240 mg IV Q2W) or SOR (400 mg oral BID). Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Additional endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review per RECIST v1.1, efficacy by tumor programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and safety. Results: 743 pts with aHCC were randomized to NIVO (n = 371) or SOR (n = 372) with minimum follow-up of 22.8 months at data cutoff. OS did not meet the predefined threshold of statistical significance (HR 0.84, P = 0.0419). Median OS (mOS) was 16.4 mo for NIVO and 14.7 mo for SOR (HR 0.85 [95% CI: 0.72–1.02]; P = 0.0752). Clinical benefit was observed across predefined subgroups, including hepatitis infection status, presence of vascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread, and region (Asia vs non-Asia). ORR was 15% for NIVO (14 pts with complete response [CR]) and 7% for SOR (5 pts with CR; Table). Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were reported in 81 pts (22%) in the NIVO arm and 179 pts (49%) in the SOR arm and led to discontinuation in 16 (4%) and 29 (8%) pts, respectively. No new safety signals were observed with NIVO. 140 pts (38%) in the NIVO arm and 170 pts (46%) in the SOR arm received subsequent therapy. Additional OS analyses and patient-reported outcomes will be presented to support the benefit of NIVO. [Table presented] Conclusions: Though the primary endpoint of OS did not achieve statistical significance vs SOR, NIVO showed clinically meaningful improvements in OS, ORR, and CR rate as 1L treatment for aHCC. NIVO demonstrated a favorable safety profile consistent with previous reports. Clinical trial identification: NCT02576509.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","8","5","341","358","1 Oct 2019","Background: Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have a poor prognosis. First-line sorafenib has been the standard of care for a decade, but the treatment landscape is expanding. This review provides a practical overview of current and future systemic treatment options for advanced HCC and their place in clinical practice. Summary: First-line sorafenib and lenvatinib have shown to improve the survival of patients with advanced HCC. In the second line, regorafenib provides benefit for patients who previously tolerated sorafenib. Anti-PD1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, recently became available for second-line use in the US. Ramucirumab (for patients with α-fetoprotein [AFP] levels ≥400) and cabozantinib present potential future second-line treatment options. Combinations of systemic and locoregional treatment, such as radiofrequency ablation or selective internal radiotherapy, require further research. Precision medicine has not yet been translated into clinical practice, as the most common driver mutations (TERT promoter, CTNNB1, TP53, and ARID1A mutations) have not yet been shown to be suitable therapeutic targets. However, our growing understanding of signaling pathways and efforts in drug development are expected to pave the way for precision medicine in HCC in the future. Evaluating the place for the current and novel systemic treatment options in clinical practice can be challenging due to the diverse toxicity profiles of the treatment options and characteristics of the patient population. Sorafenib data elucidate the effect patient characteristics (such as the performance score, Child-Pugh class, AFP, etiology of the underlying disease, and level of macrovascular invasion and extrahepatic spread) may have on outcomes in advanced stages. Key Messages: Lenvatinib is expected to join sorafenib as a preferred first-line treatment in advanced HCC. In the second line, the treatment of choice, regorafenib, is soon expected to be accompanied by cabozantinib and ramucirumab in patients with AFP ≥400 ng/mL, whereas nivolumab and pembrolizumab present second-line alternatives in the US.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02329860)",,,L626733800,10.1159/000496439
"Modeling the biological effectiveness of non-uniform dose distributions delivered from selective internal radiation therapy","Bednarz B.","European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019) 46:1 Supplement 1 (S233-S234). Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","46","1","S233","S234","1 Oct 2019","Aim/Introduction: Recently, the SARAH trial, a large randomized phase 3 study in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), showed no benefit in terms of overall survival after receiving 90Y-loaded resin microsphere selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT)1. These negative results could partially be explained by the absence of biologically-based dosimetric endpoints to prescribe the injected activity. This work describes a general method for assessing the biological effects of nonuniform dose distributions on tumors treated with SIRT. Materials and Methods: The approach is based on the concept of biologically effective dose (BED). Three different BED models are considered: (1) standard linear-quadratic dependent cell kill with dose-rate effects, (2) same as (1) but also accounting for proliferation, and (3) same as (2) but also accounting for immune system response. Tumor absorbed dose distributions were modeled as normal distributions with means μ [50 Gy,200 Gy] and standard deviations σ [0.25 Gy,100 Gy] based on PET/ MR data measured at our institution and found in the literature. Using these models the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) was calculated for varying levels of non-uniformity. Although adjustable, it was assumed that the tumors had a repair halftime of 0.5 hrs, a repopulation time of 7 days, an α/β = 10 and a α=0.35 Gy-1. For the immune system model the immune cell interaction constant was set to 0.14 day-1 and the probability of immune cell destruction per immune cell interaction was set to unity. Results: The relative effectiveness values range from 1 to 1.23 for the parameters considered. The BED varied only slightly between the different models with a maximum difference of -1.2% between model (2) and (1) and 0.27% between model (3) and (1). The EUD changed significantly as a function of the BED uniformity index σ/ μ in the tumor. Conclusion: The general method used in this work can be integrated into an image-based dosimetry workflow that could lead to improved prescription strategies for SIRT. The large uncertainties associated with the parameters used in this study could potentially be reduced by evaluating clinically-relevant biomarkers in patient samples or in vitro, which is an active area of ongoing research.",,,,L629700856,10.1007/s00259-019-04486-2
"Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: currnet status and future perspective","Kobayashi S., Ueno M., Morimoto M.","Annals of Oncology (2019) 30 Supplement 6 (vi53). Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","30",,"vi53",,"1 Oct 2019","Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is a treatment modality that provides direct delivery of highly concentrated anticancer drugs into tumour-feeding vessels using an intraarterial catheter technique and decreases the systemic distribution through the first-pass effect of the liver. Therefore, HAIC is expected to have strong anticancer effects and mild toxicity, and it has been used mainly for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with macrovascular invasion. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of HAIC even after sorafenib (SOR) became a standard treatment for advanced HCC following the result of a phase III study: however, the results were not consistent with each other because of different patients and different treatment regimens. Moreover, no phase III trial was conducted to detect the efficacy of HAIC compared to that of SOR. Based on the results, HAIC could not become a standard treatment for patients with advanced HCC. As a perspective of HAIC, combination treatment containing tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as SOR or lenvatinib (LEN) may be an area to develop. Although LEN has shown non-inferiority to sorafenib in terms of survival, both SOR and LEN have several toxicities. Therefore, SOR and LEN are difficult to combine with other treatments, whereas HAIC could be a candidate because of its mild toxicity. Two prospective randomised trials that evaluated the efficacy of SOR and HAIC combination therapy showed promising results, and a phase III study that tests the efficacy of TKIs and HAIC combination therapy is warranted. Another aspect regarding HAIC to develop may be the treatment for patients with Child-Pugh class B/C disease. Several new chemotherapeutic agents have been developed; however, these treatments, including SOR and LEN, are only intended for patients with Child-Pugh class A disease. HAIC could be developed for such unmet medical needs.",,,,L630550813,10.1093/annonc/mdz351

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","30",,"vi53",,"1 Oct 2019","For the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), phase III trials have shown that sorafenib and lenvatinib as first-line treatment agents, and regorafenib, ramcirumab, and cabozantinib as subsequent-line treatment agents in combination with sorafenib, offer survival benefit. At present, sorafenib and lenvatinib for patients with advanced HCC, and regorafenib for patients who are refractory to systemic therapy are reimbursed and can be available in Japan. In the near future, ramucirumab is also expected to be approved for further treatment after second-line treatment of HCC patients with serum AFP levels of 400 ng/mL or more, and data on cabozantinib are also expected to be submitted for approval. Furthermore, the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors is also expected. In regard to the anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab, patient enrollment for a phase III trial has been completed in a phase III study initiated to compare sorafenib and nivolumab in a first-line setting, and the final results are expected. A phase III trial conducted to compare pembrolizumab and placebo in sorafenib- refractory/intolerant patients revealed that pembrolizumab offered no survival benefit. However, the drug may be expected to be effective when used in combination with other agents. Currently, trials of combined immune checkpoint inhibitor plus immune checkpoint inhibitor and combined immune checkpoint inhibitor plus molecular-targeted agent therapy are ongoing, while some phase III trials have already been completed. In this session, current evidence on systemic therapy for advanced HCC will be reviewed and the trends in the future development of treatments for HCC will be outlined.",,,,L630550860,10.1093/annonc/mdz351.001

This phase III study compared clinical efficacy and safety of NIVO with SOR as 1L therapy in pts with aHCC. Methods: Systemic therapy-naive pts aged ≥18 years with a HCC were randomized 1:1 to NIVO (240 mg IV Q2W) or SOR (400 mg oral BID). Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Additional endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and progression- free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review per RECIST v1.1, efficacy by tumor programmed death lig and 1 (PD-L1) expression, and safety. Results: 743 pts with aHCC were randomized to NIVO (n=371) or SOR (n=372) with minimum follow-up of 22.8 months at data cutoff. OS did not meet the predefined threshold of statistical significance (HR 0.84, P=0.0419). Median OS (mOS) was 16.4 mo for NIVO and 14.7 mo for SOR (HR 0.85 [95% CI: 0.72-1.02]; P=0.0752). Clinical benefit was observed across predefined subgroups, including hepatitis infection status, presence of vascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread, and region (Asia vs non-Asia). ORR was 15% for NIVO (14 pts with complete response [CR]) and 7% for SOR (5 pts with CR; Table). Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were reported in 81 pts (22%) in the NIVO arm and 179 pts (49%) in the SOR arm and led to discontinuation in 16 (4%) and 29 (8%) pts, respectively. No new safety signals were observed with NIVO. 140 pts (38%) in the NIVO arm and 170 pts (46%) in the SOR arm received subsequent therapy. Additional OS analyses and patient-reported outcomes will be presented to support the benefit of NIVO. Conclusions: Though the primary endpoint of OS did not achieve statistical significance vs SOR, NIVO showed clinically meaningful improvements in OS, ORR, and CR rate as 1L treatment for aHCC.

Pts were Child-Pugh A and ECOG PS≤1, must have received prior sorafenib, and could have received up to 2 prior systemic regimens for HCC. Plasma samples were collected at baseline and on treatment for 674 pts and analyzed by Luminex assay (Assay Gate) for MET, AXL, VEGFR2, c-KIT, HGF, GAS6, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, PlGF, ANG2, IL-8, IGF- 1, and EPO. OS and PFS were evaluated for low and high baseline biomarker levels dichotomized at the median. Prognostic factors were identified by comparing high vs low biomarker levels within each treatment arm, using the criterion that the HR 95% CI does not include 1.0. Biomarkers were considered predictive if p≤0.05 for the interaction between treatment and subgroup. Results: For low and high levels of all 13 biomarkers analyzed, hazard ratios favored C over P for both OS (Table) and PFS (all C vs P HRs<0.55; not shown).

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","30",,"v282",,"1 Oct 2019","Background: Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) using yttrium-90 resin microspheres was compared to sorafenib 400mg bid in a phase 3 randomised trial (SARAH) in the treatment of intermediate or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not amenable to curative treatment. The trial did not show a survival benefit of SIRT over sorafenib in the intention to treat (ITT) population. The effectiveness of SIRT may depend on the tumour-absorbed dose, which can be predicted with the analysis of SPECT/CT imaging during each patient work-up, before the administration of SIRT. In this post hoc analysis we explored the comparative effectiveness of SIRT and sorafenib in a subgroup of patients defined by their predicted tumour-absorbed dose. Methods: Cox proportional hazards regressions were conducted in the ITT population of the SARAH trial. Since predicted tumour-absorbed dose was only available for SIRT, the comparisons between SIRT at a given dose and sorafenib were not randomised. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using propensity scores was used to account for potential confounding by differences in prognostic factors between the treatment arms, with the sorafenib sample reweighted to match the SIRT patients. A cut-off value of 100 Gy was used for tumour absorbed dose, approximating the median dose, with 120 Gy used in a sensitivity analysis. Results: For patients with a predicted dose ≥100 Gy, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) from the unweighted sample was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.50-0.98, p=0.04). After reweighting, the HR was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.51-1.04, p=0.09). Predicted mean OS was 22.5 months (mos) for SIRT vs 17.9 mos for sorafenib. Results were similar with a 120 Gy cut-off: the HR for OS was 0.76 (95% CI 0.52-1.10, p=0.14). Among patients who received subsequent curative therapy post-SIRT, 11/12 were alive at the end of follow-up (median 26.6 mos, range 16.0-34.8) and only one had a predicted dose <100 Gy. Conclusions: The analysis suggests that HCC patients may derive a meaningful benefit from treatment using SIRT with a predicted dose ≥100 Gy compared to sorafenib.

We report updated results from a phase 1b trial of LEN+ PEMBRO in uHCC. Methods: In this open-label, phase 1b study of LEN + PEMBRO in uHCC, 104 patients (pts) with BCLC stage B (not amenable for transarterial chemoembolization) or C, Child-Pugh class A, and ECOG PS ≤1 received LEN (body wt ≥60 kg: 12 mg/day; <60 kg: 8 mg/day QD) and PEMBRO (200 mg IV Q3W). Primary endpoints were safety (DLT part) and efficacy (expansion part; objective response rate [ORR] and duration of response [DOR]). Investigators performed tumor assessments using modified RECIST for HCC. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported in the DLT part (n=6). Enrollment was expanded to approximately 100 pts (expansion part). Recruitment (N=104) was completed April 2019. We present results for the first 67 pts enrolled by December 31, 2018.

In addition, no evidence has been established for early introduction of molecular targeted therapy in BCLC stage B patients. Therefore, we verified the efficacy and safety in the patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria of REFLECT trial and those who were BCLC Stage B. Methods: A total of 203 patients received LENfromMarch 2018 to January 2019 at 21 sites in Japanese Red Cross Study Liver Group were registered. 128 cases out of REFLECT trial criteria and 74 cases of BCLC Stage B were retrospectively investigated. Tumors assessments in accordance with modified RECIST were done using dynamic CT and/or MRI. Results: 128 of 203 (63%) patients did notmeet the inclusion criteria of the REFLECT trial. These cases included 69 receiving TKI therapy before LEN. The ORR and DCR in TKI naïve were 45% and 84%, respectively, and were 29%and 81%in TKI experienced (p=0.072, p=0.671). The OS between TKI naïve and experienced patients was not significantly different (p=0.618), even though baseline albumin level and ALBI score were significantly lower in TKI experienced patients than TKI naïve (p=0.001 and 0.005). 74 cases of BCLC Stage B included 57with TACE history, 8 without, and 9 cases unknown. Although there was no difference between two groups in the baseline Child-Pugh score, ALBI score and AFP value, patients with TACE less than 6 times (n=53) before LEN was significantly better inOS than those with TACE of 6 times ormore (n=12) (p=0.025). Conclusions: Also in TKI experienced which was excluded fromthe REFLECT trial, ORR, DCR and OS did not differ fromTKI naïve, and LEN may be useful asTKI 2nd line and 3rd line.

In REACH-2 RAM treatment (trt) improved overall survival (OS) compared to P, consistent with REACH (AFP ≥400 ng/ mL) pts. Here we present post-hoc analyses assessing the prognostic and predictive value of baseline AFP in both studies. Methods: Pts with HCC, Child-Pugh A, ECOG PS 0-1, and prior sorafenib were randomized to RAM 8 mg/kg or P Q2W. The prognostic value of baseline AFP was assessed by Cox regression models with either continuous or dichotomous (≥400 vs<400 ng/ml) AFP (REACH, N=565), and confirmed using Cox model with continuous AFP ≥400 ng/mL (REACH-2, N=292). Cox model with AFP and its trt interaction assessed the predictive value of baseline AFP in REACH. Subpopulation trt effect pattern plot (STEPP) assessed the interaction between RAM trt and AFP in REACH, REACH-2 and pooled individual pt data analysis of both studies (AFP ≥400 mg/mL). Results: Baseline AFP was confirmed as a significant continuous (REACH and REACH-2; p<.0001) and dichotomous (REACH; p<.01) prognostic factor for OS. AFP remained the predominant prognostic factor after adjusting for other significant prognostic factors, including macrovascular invasion and ECOG PS. The interaction between AFP and trt effect was significant in REACH (p=.0042 continuous; p<.0001 dichotomous), suggesting the predictive value of AFP in RAM OS benefit. Based on Cox regression of OS on continuous AFP level and its interaction with trt, the estimated OS hazard ratio in REACH (<0.8, 95% CI below 1) was significant at each AFP value ≥400 ng/mL, supporting AFP ≥400 ng/mL as selection criterion for RAM OS benefit. STEPP supported these results with OS benefits at each AFP value ≥400 ng/mL. Conclusions: The prognostic impact of baseline AFP is an important factor to consider in trial design.

CELESTIAL was stopped early for benefit at the second interim analysis (hazard ratio for death in overall population, 0.76 [95% confidence interval 0.63-0.92; p=0.005] resulting in short follow-up for some patients). This retrospective analysis compared patient experience of three discrete health states in patients receiving second-line cabozantinib vs placebo in CELESTIAL: time with grade 3/4 toxicity before progression (TOX); time without grade 3/4 toxicity before progression (TWiST); and survival time after progression or relapse (REL). Methods: Overall, 495 patients in CELESTIAL had sorafenib as the only prior therapy (cabozantinib, 331; placebo, 164). For each patient, times spent in TOX, TWiST and REL were calculated. Toxicities were based on reported adverse events. Patients censored prior to progression or death (32%) accrued time in each health state up to that date. Results: Second-line cabozantinib was associated with significantly longer mean TOX (49.8 vs 9.8 days, p<0.0001), and also TWiST (110.9 vs 78.1 days, p=0.001) than placebo; survival times after progression (REL) were similar; (Table).

Within each age subgroup, baseline characteristics between treatment arms were similar. Patients of<65 years showed a higher incidence of hepatitis B, extrahepatic spread, and a higher AFP level when compared with patients in older age subgroups across treatment arms. Efficacy outcomes are summarized in the table. Safety profiles of RAM were comparable between <65 and ≥65-<75 age subgroups. The incidence of ≥Grade 3 treatment-emergent AEs was higher in RAM arm than PL arm in ≥75 age subgroup (e.g. hypertension and fatigue). A trend toward a delay in the deterioration of symptoms in FHSI-8 for RAMarm was observed in all age subgroups. Conclusions: Efficacy and safety profiles of RAM observed in each age subgroup were consistent with those in the entire population. This exploratory subgroup analysis supports the use of RAM for the treatment of HCC with elevated AFP, irrespective of age. (Table Presented) .",,,,L630603700,10.1093/annonc/mdz247.083

Pembro reduced the risk of death by 22% and improved progression-free survival over BSC in pts with advanced HCC, although significance was not reached per prespecified statistical criteria. Here we present the results of prespecified exploratory HRQoL analyses. Methods: The EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-HCC18 questionnaires were administered electronically at baseline; weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18; every 9 weeks thereafter up to 1 year or end of treatment; and at the 30-day safety follow-up visit. Least squares mean (LSM) score changes from baseline to week 12 (prespecified) were compared using constrained longitudinal data analysis model including treatment by study visit interaction and stratification factors as covariates. Time to deterioration (TTD) (≥10- point decline from baseline) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method, and the magnitude of the treatment difference (hazard ratio) between treatment arms was assessed by a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Pts receiving ≥1 dose of study treatment and completing≥1 HRQoL assessment were included in the analysis. The HRQoL population included 398 pts (271 pembro; 127 BSC). HRQoL compliance at week 12 was 90.0% for pembro and 89.3% for BSC. From baseline to week 12, there was no statistically significant difference in LSM between the 2 arms for global health status (GHS)/QoL score (-1.19; 95% CI, -5.35, 2.97; P=0.573).

(1, 2) AHP is also associated with multiple long-term complications, including neuropathy (3,4), hypertension (5,6), chronic kidney disease (7), and hepatocellular carcinoma (8,9). METHODS: ENVISION (NCT03338816) was a Phase 3 global, multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial with an open label extension to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous givosiran in AHP. Eligible patients had an AHP diagnosis and ≥2 attacks within the prior 6 months. At baseline detailed medical history and laboratory assessments were obtained. RESULTS: Ninety-four AHP patients enrolled, median (range) age 37.5 (19-65) years, 89% female, and median (range) of 6.5 (0.1-43) years since diagnosis. Patients had a median of 4 composite attacks in the preceding 6 months and 40% were on hemin prophylaxis prior to study. Half the patients experienced daily chronic symptoms and 29% used opioids daily/most days between attacks. Comorbidities reported on medical history included neuropathy (38%), central venous access complications (71%), iron overload (33%), liver disease (28%), and chronic kidney disease (18%). At baseline 17% of patients had liver transaminases> ULN and 34% had an eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73m2.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2019","2019","25",,"S27","S28","1 Oct 2019","BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is often diagnosed in advanced stages when systemic therapies are recommended. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends 2 agents (sorafenib, lenvatinib) in the first-line (1L) setting and 5 agents (regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab) in the second-line (2L) setting. OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics, treatments, and clinical outcomes of patients with advanced HCC enrolled in interventional trials administering systemic therapies. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify trials (any phase) reporting efficacy of systemic therapies in patients with advanced HCC from the United States, China, Japan, or South Korea in Embase/MEDLINE articles from 2008-2018 and Clinicaltrials.gov entries. Patient, treatment, efficacy, and safety data were extracted and synthesized, and weighted means based on trial arm sample size were calculated and stratified by line of therapy. RESULTS: From 3,722 total citations, 118 unique trials (1L: 45, 2L: 73) describing 13,534 patients were included. Most trials were phase 2 (49%) or phase 3 (14%). Most trials were single-arm or dose-escalation studies (75%), or compared 2 active arms (13%), active arm vs. placebo (10%), or active arm vs. best supportive care (2%). Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) was the most frequently used staging system (47%); most patients in both 1L and 2L cohorts were BCLC C (81%). Evidence of advanced disease included extrahepatic spread (1L: 58%, 2L: 66%), vascular invasion (1L: 33%, 2L: 28%), and portal vein thrombosis (1L: 34%, 2L: 18%). Patients had undergone previous resection (1L: 29%, 2L: 40%), ablation (1L: 13%, 2L: 19%), and other loco-regional treatments (1L: 42%, 2L: 63%). Similar results for active therapy arms were observed for 1L and 2L cohorts in overall response rates (1L: 9%, 2L: 8%), disease control rates (1L: 57%, 2L, 55%), median progression-free survival (mPFS; 1L: 4.2 mo, 2L: 3.5 mo), and overall survival (mOS; 1L: 10.0 mo, 2L: 9.6 mo). The mPFS/ mOS of NCCN-recommended therapies trended longer vs. other active agents (1L: 4.3/10.4 mo vs. 4.0/9.0 mo, 2L: 3.9/10.7 mo vs. 3.3/8.9 mo). Among all active therapy arms, patients had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) that led to discontinuation (1L: 26%, 2L: 18%) or experienced Grade 3+ TEAE (1L: 60%, 2L: 55%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent FDA approvals, advanced HCC patients continue to have poor outcomes.

High rates of SVR have been observed among patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who received 12 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir (SOF) combined with ledipasvir (LDV) for genotype (GT) -1 infection. However, the risk in patients treated with IFN-free direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) is unknown The aim of this study was to investigate the rate of development of HCC in Japanese patients who achieved SVR by LDV/SOF and protease inhibitor with Peg- IFN plus ribavirin (PI-IFN) Methods: Three hundred twenty Japanese patients with HCV GT-1 received LDV/SOF (DAAs group) for 12 weeks at 19 hospitals as a multicenter Phase 3 clinical trial(NCT01975675) in 2013 For control subjects, we simultaneously enrolled 289 HCV GT-1 patients who received protease inhibitor with peginterferon plus ribavirin (PI-IFN group) for 24 weeks in 2013 All patents achieved SVR and none of the patients had prior history of HCC. Ultrasonography, contrast-enhanced computer tomography (CT) or Gadoliniumethoxybenzyl- diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) were used for the diagnosis of HCC by the treatment before 4 months and prospectively followed 5 years after the treatment. In addition, 205 patients with SVR by LDV/SOF in 2015 who were excluded hepatic nodules by EOB-MRI at baseline also observed at least for 3 years (EOB-MRI group) This trial is registered with UMIN, number 000015933 Results: There were no difference in age, sex, body mass index(BMI), ALT, AST, T-Bilirubin, Albumin, Platelet, FIB4 index, fatty liver and history of diabetes mellitus at baseline between DAAs and PI-IFN group However, AFP levels in DAAs group were significantly higher than those in PI-IFN group (11.9 and 7.4 ng/mL, P=0.0045). HCV RNA level was lower than in PI-IFN group compared with DAAs group (6 3 and 6 6 log IU/mL, P<0 001) During the observation period, HCC developed in 9 (2 8%) and 7 (2 4%) patients in DAAs and PI-IFN groups, respectively Propensity score matching analysis also showed no significant difference in HCC development rates between the two groups Fourteen (88%, DAAs n=8, PI-IFN n=6) patients developed HCC within 2 5 years after the treatment Among them, 11 (78%) patients who took CT or EOB-MRI at baseline could be retrospectively recognized hepatic nodules None of patients in EOB-MRI group developed HCC Conclusion: The incidence of HCC improved following LDV/SOF regimen to a similar degree as achieved with protease inhibitor with PI-IFN Unexpected development of HCC after SVR in patients without previous HCC were rare and they can detect by EOB-MRI.",,,,L631810296,

CAF profiles, clinical chemistry/ hematology parameters, and clinical background were evaluated to explore biomarkers associated with early AFP reduction, progression-free survival (PFS), adverse events, and relative dose intensity (RDI) Results: RDI decreased significantly between weeks 1-2 and 3-4 (p<0.0001), and RDI during weeks 3-4 was a prominent indicator of PFS Higher platelet, AST, AFP-L3, and DCP levels, and lower albumin levels and prior sorafenib/regorafenib history were associated with poor RDI A signature based on baseline serum levels of 9 CAFs associated with RDI and adverse events was identified. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, patients classified as non-good (poor or intermediate) had a higher risk of progressive disease than patients with a good 9-CAFs signature (hazard ratio [HR] 2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.2-7.8, p=0.022). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that RDI is an important predictive factor for longer PFS and confirms the importance of maintaining high RDI during lenvatinib treatment This exploratory biomarker analysis identified a CAFs-signature associated with adverse events and RDI, which might improve management of lenvatinib treatment in HCC patients.",,,,L631811830,

HES includes current AFP, age, platelets, ALT, and rate of change from previous AFP value within the past year In this analysis, we validated the HES algorithm's ability to improve the likelihood of early HCC detection in a prospective VA HCC surveillance cohort and compared it to AFP, AFP-3, DCP and GALAD score Methods: We conducted a phase 3 biomarker study (prospective-specimen collection, retrospective-blindedevaluation) during 08/2014-10/2018. We enrolled patients with cirrhosis and no prior HCC in a 6-month surveillance program consisting of liver imaging (mostly ultrasound) and AFP HCC was diagnosed according to American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria ALT and platelets were measured in every visit Blood samples were prospectively collected every 6 months and were analyzed for AFP, AFP L-3, and DCP in a retrospective blinded fashion. We calculated patient-level sensitivity and screening-level false positive rate (FPR) for detecting HCC for AFP, AFP L-3, DCP, the GALAD score, which combined the 3 biomarkers with age and gender, and the HES algorithm For easier comparisons, we calculated sensitivity at a fixed FPR of 10%. Controls were patients with cirrhosis under surveillance who did not develop HCC Results: We analyzed 1,431 total study visits for 513 controls and 49 HCC cases that developed after enrollment in the surveillance cohort. We restricted the analysis to study visits prior to or at HCC diagnosis. We further restricted controls to only those with consistently negative liver imaging results, and to those with ALT and platelets measured in all study visits The mean age of the overall cohort was 63 years and 98% were men. Cirrhosis etiology was HCV in 72%, alcohol 60%, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in 22% At the time of diagnosis, the mean tumor size was 2 1 cm (standard deviation, SD 0 9), and 69% of patients had only one HCC nodule The sensitivity of each of AFP, AFP- 3 and DCP were low and comparable GALAD score had higher sensitivity than each of triple markers However HES (which does not so far incorporate AFP-3 or DCP) yielded a similar sensitivity to GALAD, and 6 percentage points higher than AFP alone (Table) Conclusion: In a HCC surveillance cohort of patients with cirrhosis from different etiologies, the use of HES algorithm results in a considerable improvement over AFP alone in the sensitivity for HCC detection with no added testing or cost This improvement rivals that of GALAD score, which uses AFP-3 and DCP in addition. We are now investigating the possible additional yield to HES from adding AFP-3 and DCP (Table Presented).",,,,L631813775,

Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for HCC was calculated for observed cases relative to predicted risk using the REACH-B model Results: Through 4 years of follow-up, HCC occurred in 16/1632 patients (0.98%; TAF 7/1093 [0.64%]; TDF 9/539 [1.67%]). Of 16 cases of HCC, 5 and 11 were in cirrhotic and non cirrhotic patients respectively. Median (Q1, Q3) time to HCC onset was 566 (318, 855) days (TAF 747 [392, 1370], TDF 460 [180, 729] days). At baseline, relative to those without HCC, patients with HCC were older (median age 53 vs 40 y; p<0.001), had lower HBV DNA (6.3 vs 7.3 log10 IU/ mL; p=0 041), and were more likely to be cirrhotic (FibroTest score ≥0.75; 31% vs 10%; p=0.004). With treatment (TAF or TDF), HCC incidence was significantly reduced (16 observed vs 35.3 predicted; SIR [95% CI] 0.45 [0.278 -0.740]) [Table]. For TAF-treated patients, a significant risk reduction was seen (7 observed vs 22.4 predicted, SIR [95% CI] 0.31 [0.149-0.655]), whereas with TDF there was a reduction in incidence but it did not achieve significance (9 observed vs 12.9 predicted, SIR [95% CI] 0.7 [0.364, 1.344]).

Methods: In REFLECT, patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma were randomized 1:1 to receive first-line LEN or SOR. Objective response was defined as complete or partial response by mRECIST per investigator. Patients with disease progression and who discontinued treatment were followed for survival every 12 weeks; subsequent anticancer medication during survival follow-up were recorded until time of death. Data cutoff: Nov 13, 2016. mOS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates with 2-sided 95% CIs. Results: In REFLECT, one-third of the overall study population (156/478 patients randomized to LEN and 184/476 to SOR) received subsequent anticancer medication, most commonly SOR (25% in LEN arm). ECOG performance status and laboratory assessments, including liver function tests, were comparable between arms prior to subsequent treatments. Among these patients, mOS was 21 vs 17 mo and ORR was 27.6% vs 8.7% for LEN vs SOR arms, respectively. In a subset analysis of LEN responders who received any subsequent anticancer medication (n=43), mOS was 26 mo (95% CI 18.5-34.6). For SOR responders who received any subsequent anticancer medication (n=16), mOS was 22 mo (95% CI, 14.6-NE). For LEN responders who subsequently received SOR (n=35), mOS was 26 mo (95% CI 18.2-34.6). Conclusions: In REFLECT, one-third of patients randomized to first-line LEN received subsequent anticancer medication, including SOR, with a mOS of 21 mo. In this exploratory post hoc analysis of patients who responded to LEN and received any subsequent anticancer medication or SOR, mOS was 26 mo.",,,,L640065759,10.1159/000502425

CELESTIAL was stopped early for benefit at the second interim analysis. This post hoc analysis estimated the incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued in CELESTIAL. Methods: Health utility was elicited at each study visit using the EQ-5D-5L quality of life questionnaire. (completed by 82-100% of patients overall). UK crosswalk tariffs were applied for health states. Cumulative QALYs by patient were calculated by linear interpolation; for patients who were censored (31% of patients; including 9% within 100 days of randomization), the last observed utility value was carried forward to study end. The difference in restricted mean QALYs was calculated using generalized linear models, accounting for baseline utility, and with 0.06-0.08 QALYs considered the minimal important difference. Results: At day 50 after randomization (acute treatment phase), cabo was associated with a small reduction in mean total QALYs vs pbo (difference -0.003; 95% CI -0.005 to -0.002; p≤0.001; n=601 [cabo, n=389; pbo, n=212]).

In a previous single dose PK study, increased C exposure was observed in pts with mild or moderate hepatic impairment compared with healthy volunteers (HV) (Nguyen, J Clin Pharmacol. 2016). An integrated PopPK model was recently developed to characterize C concentration data from HV and pts with various cancer types, including renal cell carcinoma, castration-resistant prostate cancer, and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) (Lacy, Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2018). Here the model has been updated to include data for pts with advanced HCC from CELESTIAL and a previous phase 2 trial. Methods: The updated PopPK model was developed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling methodology (NONMEM v7.3) and incorporated data from 10 clinical studies with 9510 measurable C concentrations from 2023 subjects, including 489 pts with advanced HCC. Eligible pts with HCC had Child-Pugh A liver function. Covariates that were evaluated included age, gender, race, body weight, cancer type, and liver dysfunction as defined by the National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI-ODWG). Results: A 2-compartment model with first-order elimination and dual first-and zero-order absorption processes adequately described the observed C concentration data. Similar to the previous model, the MTC population was the only cancer type to have a notable difference in C PK, with an ∼90% increase in apparent clearance (CL/F) compared to HV and pts with other cancer types including HCC. For a White male subject, CL/F was estimated as 2.48 L/hr and apparent volume of the central compartment (Vc/F) as 212 L. Inter-individual variability was estimated as 46% for CL/F and 67% for Vc/F. Other demographic covariates were predicted to have a small to moderate impact on C CL/F. Liver dysfunction, as defined by NCI-ODWG criteria, had no discernable effect on C CL/F. Conclusions: C exposure at an equivalent daily dose is predicted to be similar in pts with several cancer types including advanced HCC with mild liver dysfunction.",,,,L640065848,10.1159/000502425

In a phase 3 trial (REFLECT), LEN demonstrated a treatment effect on overall survival (OS) by statistical confirmation of noninferiority vs sorafenib for first-line treatment of uHCC. Dosing by bw was implemented in REFLECT based on a phase 2 study of LEN in uHCC and PK modeling showing an exposure-response relationship with higher LEN AUC and lower bw resulting in earlier drug withdrawal or dose reduction. Cutoff values established were LEN 8 mg/d for bw < 60 kg and 12 mg/d for bw ≥60 kg. This post hoc analysis of REFLECT assessed safety and efficacy of LEN in patients with bw >80 kg. Methods: Details of REFLECT methodology are previously published. For this analysis, patients were stratified by baseline bw: < 60 kg, ≥60 to ≤80 kg, and >80 kg. Safety and efficacy outcomes by bw group were generated. Results: Baseline demographics among the groups were similar, except that patients with bw >80 kg were more likely to be white, from western regions, and have higher body mass indexes. For bw < 60 kg, bw ≥60 to ≤80 kg, and >80 kg: the median treatment durations (months) were 5.59, 6.29, and 6.54, respectively; mean LEN relative dose intensities were 87%, 86%, and 93%, respectively.

Here, we retrospectively evaluate the associatlon of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (PPE) and hypertension (HTN) with OS and PFS for C in the CELESTIAL trial. Methods: 707 pts with aHCC were randomized 2: 1 to receive 60 mg C or P once daily. Eligible pts had Child-Puqh score A, ECOG PS ≤1, must have received prior sorafenib and could have received up to two prior regimens of systemic therapy for HCC. OS and PFS with C were evaluated for pts with any grade PPE or ≥ grade 3HTN within the first 8weeks of study treatment. Results: Overall, 374 (80%) pts in the C arm and 179 (76) pts in the P arm completed ≥ 8 weeks of treatment. In the first 8 weeks, 188 (40%) of C-treated pts developed any grade PPE vs 11 (5%) of P-treated pts and 61 (13%) of C-treated pts developed grade ≥3 HTN vs 3 (1%) of P-treated pts.

Cabozantinib is approved in the United States and Europe for treatment of aHCC after prior sorafenib based on improved overall survival (OS) vs placebo in the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial (Abou-Alfa NEJM 2018). Cabozantinib may promote an immune-permissive tumor environment, which could enhance response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Cabozantinib is being evaluated in combination with the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab in multiple tumor types including HCC in a phase 1 study; recommended dose, preliminary clinical activity, and safety of the combination have been established in aRCC (Agarwal Ann Oncol 2018). Atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody, has shown preliminary clinical activity in first-line aHCC (Pishvaian Ann Oncol 2018).

Combining sorafenib with another treatment, to improve overall survival (OS) within an acceptable safety profile, might be the next step forward in the management of patients with advanced HCC. We aimed to assess whether a combination of sorafenib and a statin improved survival in patients with HCC. Methods: The objective of the PRODIGE-11 trial was to compare the respective clinical outcomes of the sorafenib-pravastatin combination (arm A) versus sorafenib alone (arm B) in patients with advanced HCC. Child-Pugh A patients with advanced HCC who were naive to systemic treatment (n = 323) were randomly assigned to sorafenib-pravastatin combination (n = 162) or sorafenib alone (n = 161). The primary endpoint was OS; secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, time to tumor progression, time to treatment failure, safety, and quality of life. Results: After randomization, 312 patients received at least 1 dose of study treatment. After a median follow-up of 35 months, 269 patients died (arm A: 135; arm B: 134) with no difference in median OS between treatments arms (10.7 months vs. 10.5 months; hazard ratio = 1.00; p = 0.975); no difference was observed in secondary survival endpoints either. In the univariate analysis, the significant prognostic factors for OS were CLIP score, performance status, and quality of life scores. The multivariate analysis showed that the only prognostic factor for OS was the CLIP score. The main toxicity was diarrhea (which was severe in 11% of patients in arm A, and 8.9% in arm B), while severe nausea-vomiting was rare, and no toxicity-related deaths were reported. Conclusion: Adding pravastatin to sorafenib did not improve survival in patients with advanced HCC. Lay summary: Sorafenib has proven efficacy for the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, overall survival remains poor in these patients, so we were interested to see if the addition of a statin, pravastatin, improved outcomes in patients with advanced HCC. This randomized-controlled trial demonstrated that the sorafenib-pravastatin combination did not improve overall survival in this study population compared to sorafenib alone.

TTFields (200 kHz) are FDA-approved for the treatment of glioblastoma based on phase 3 studies demonstrating efficacy and high safety profile. TTFields are currently being tested as a treatment option for other solid tumors in the brain, abdomen and torso. We evaluated if the safety profile of TTFields is maintained at various frequencies in different body regions. Materials/Methods: TTFields were applied for 1-4 weeks using the Novo-TTF 100 system to: rat torso, and rabbit brain and torso, 2-3 V/cm and 150 and 200 kHz, which are intensities and frequencies known to be effective for the treatment of GBM, NSCLC, mesothelioma, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. The safety of TTFields in combination with liposomal doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel was tested in animals. Throughout the treatment course, all animals underwent daily clinical examination by a certified experienced veterinarian and their body weight was determined on a weekly basis. Extensive blood workup, ECG and temperature measurements were performed in the rabbit experiments. At the end of treatment, animals were euthanized and an experienced independent pathologist performed histological comparative evaluation of all major internal organs. Results: No changes in the following parameters were observed: activity level, food intake, drinking, stools, motor neurological status and respiration. Further, no changes in weight were observed between the TTFields treated and the relevant control groups. No significant changes were observed in complete blood count and differential between TTFields treated animals and the relevant control groups. Histological analysis did not reveal any increase in pathological findings in the TTFields treated animals group. Conclusion: Taken together, these results demonstrate the safety of TTFields application at frequencies of 150-200 kHz to different body regions. No additional toxicities were observed with the combination of TTFields and chemotherapeutic agents vs. chemotherapy agents alone.

Current international guidelines recommend Sorafenib as the only treatment option in patients with MVI, based on the results of 2 randomized trials showing that Sorafenib improves overall survival compared with no treatment. Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) has become a treatment option in patients with HCC who are not eligible for other local therapies, including those with MVI. The purpose of this IRB approved study is to describe long-term outcomes of patients with HCC and MVI treated with SBRT. Materials/Methods: Patients with HCC and MVI who were treated with SBRT from January 2003 to December 2016 were eligible for analysis. Patients who had extrahepatic disease, had previous liver transplant, or were treated with palliative intent were excluded. Demographical, clinical, and treatment variables were collected, under IRB approval. The degree of vascular invasion was quantified into two categories: main portal vein branch/IVC and distal portal/hepatic vein. Results: One hundred twenty-eight eligible pts with HCC and MVI were treated with SBRT. The median age was 61 yrs (39 to 90 yrs). Underlying liver disease was hepatitis B in 23%, hepatitis C in 45%. Baseline Child-Pugh (CP) score was A5 in 67%, A6 in 20%, B7 or higher in 13%. Thirty-five percent received previous liver-directed therapies. Median gross tumor volume (GTV) was 153.7 mL (range: 3.9 to 1,813.5 mL). Median AFP was 205 ug/L (range 1 to 171,154). Median SBRT dose was 33.3 Gy (range: 27 to 54 Gy) in 6 fractions. Local control at 1 year was 82.4% (95% CI 72.8 to 88.8%); SBRT dose, GTV volume, or treatment era were not statistically significant on univariate analysis. Median overall survival (OS) was 18.3 months (95% CI 11.2 to 21.4 months) for which baseline ECOG PS >1 (HR:1.73, p=0.02), baseline CP score (HR: 1.66, p=0.03), and treatment between 2003 and 2010 (HR: 2.28, p=0.0009) were significant on multivariate analysis; SBRT dose, GTV volume, and degree of vascular invasion were not statistically significant for survival.

The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) compared with other local therapies in untreated solitary primary HCC patients. We hypothesized that SBRT shows superior overall survival (OS) to that with TACE and similar LC to that with RFA. Materials/Methods: The eligibility criteria included the following: 1) primary nodular HCC pathologically proven or clinically diagnosed via computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound; 2) no prior surgery, RFA, or TACE for HCC; 3) Child–Pugh score of 7 or less; 4) age of 20–85 years; 5) unsuitability for or refusal of surgery and RFA; 6) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2; 7) appropriate organ functions; and 8) written informed consent.

Conclusion: LC and OS after SBRT for untreated solitary HCC were excellent despite the patients being unfit for resection and RFA. We could not draw definite conclusions due to early study closure, but our results were very promising. A randomized phase III study is warranted to confirm the effectiveness of SBRT.

A novel, stratified prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pc-VPC) was developed to show robustness of the exposure–response relationships. Time-to-event simulations confirmed the benefit of the recommended dosing schedule of 800 mg/day: initial doses of 800 mg/day were associated with the highest PFS, whereas lower doses (600 or 400 mg/day) were associated with improved tolerability but reduced PFS. A simulated dose-reduction strategy of 800 mg/day for an initial two cycles followed by dose reductions seemed likely to maintain efficacy while possibly mitigating selected AEs (e.g., diarrhea and hand-foot skin reactions).",,,30920122,L627276412,10.1111/cts.12634

In the Phase III CELESTIAL trial (NCT01908426), cabozantinib significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo in patients with previously treated advanced HCC.1 Here, we evaluate outcomes based on plasma biomarkers in the CELESTIAL trial. Methods: A total of 707 patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive cabozantinib (60 mg daily) or placebo. Included patients had a Child-Pugh score of A and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) ≤ 1, must have received prior sorafenib, and could have received up to two prior systemic regimens for HCC. Plasma samples were collected at baseline and on treatment for 674 patients and analyzed by Luminex assay (Assay Gate) for MET, AXL, VEGFR2, c-KIT, HGF, GAS6, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, PlGF, ANG2, IL-8, IGF-1, and EPO. OS and PFS were evaluated for low and high baseline biomarker levels dichotomized at the median. Prognostic factors were identified by comparing low versus high biomarker levels within each treatment arm, using the criterion that the hazard ratio (HR) 95% confidence interval does not include 1.0. Biomarkers were considered predictive if P ≤ 0.05 for the interaction between treatment and subgroup. Results: For low and high levels of all 13 biomarkers analyzed, HRs favored cabozantinib over placebo for both OS and PFS (all cabozantinib vs placebo HRs < 0.55; not shown). Analyses comparing low with high biomarker levels identified MET, AXL, HGF, GAS6, VEGF-A, ANG2, IL-8, IGF-1, and EPO as possible prognostic factors for OS in one or both treatment arms. No baseline biomarkers were found to be predictive of an OS benefit with cabozantinib (P interaction > 0.05). Conclusion: Cabozantinib treatment was associated with improved OS and PFS compared with placebo in previously treated advanced HCC, irrespective of baseline biomarker levels. Low baseline levels of MET, HGF, GAS6, VEGF-A, ANG2, and IL-8 and high levels of IGF-1 were identified as potential prognostic biomarkers for longer OS in the placebo group.",,,,L629456532,10.1111/jgh.14797

CELESTIAL was stopped early for benefit at the second interim analysis. This post hoc analysis estimated the incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) accrued in the CELESTIAL trial. Methods: Health utility was elicited at each study visit using the EQ-5D- 5L quality-of-life questionnaire (completed by 82-100% of patients overall). UK crosswalk tariffs were applied for health states. Cumulative QALYs by patient were calculated by linear interpolation; for patients who were censored (31% of patients; including 9% within 100 days of randomization), the last observed utility value was carried forward to study end. The difference in restricted mean QALYs was calculated using generalized linear models, accounting for baseline utility, and with 0.06-0.08 QALYs considered the minimal important difference. Results: At day 50 after randomization (acute treatment phase), cabozantinib was associated with a small reduction in mean total QALYs compared with placebo (difference, -0.003; 95% CI, -0.005 to -0.002; P ≤ 0.001; n = 601 [cabozantinib, 389; placebo, 212]).

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2019","2019","34",,"50",,"1 Sep 2019","Background and Aim: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and particularly its necroinflammatory form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is strongly associated with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. NASH can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although there is strong evidence that exercise and weight loss can reverse the condition, there is no effective and approved treatment for NASH. Previously, we have shown that a selective peroxisomal-proliferation activator receptor delta (PPAR- δ) agonist, seladelpar (MBX-8025), at 10 mg/kg, was effective in reversing NASH in mice. Seladelpar has now entered into Phase II clinical trials for NASH, as well as Phase III clinical trials for primary biliary cholangitis. Seladelpar has lower selectivity for PPAR-δ over PPAR-α in mice (53-fold) than in humans (600-fold). It is therefore of interest to explore a lower dose of seladelpar to clarify the role of PPAR-δ in NASH reversal. Here, we compared seladelpar at 3 and 10 mg/kg to Wy-14643, a selective PPAR-α agonist, in an insulin-resistant mouse model of NASH. Methods: From weaning, wild-type (WT) or Alms1(-/-) mutant (foz/foz) C57BL6J (B6) mice were fed an atherogenic diet for at least 16 weeks. Groups of mice (n = 44-27) were dosed daily by oral gavage from 16 through 24 weeks and included seladelpar 10 mg/kg, seladelpar 3 mg/kg, Wy-14643 100 mg/kg, and vehicle. At 24 weeks, blood, liver, subcutaneous white adipose tissue, mesenteric visceral adipose tissue, and extensor digitalis longus muscle were removed. Results: At 16 weeks, atherogenic-fed foz/foz mice developed NASH with early fibrosis, whereas WT livers showed mild steatosis. There was progressive worsening of liver fibrosis from 16 to 24 weeks in vehicle-treated foz/foz mice. At 24 weeks, we observed significant decreases in serum alanine aminotransferase, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels with seladelpar 3 mg/kg, similar to seladelpar 10 mg/kg and Wy-14643 treatment. The lower seladelpar dose also lowered serum insulin and insulin resistance (HOMAIR) at 24 weeks, similar to 10 mg/kg and Wy-14643. Glucose tolerance (intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test) was improved in lower-dose seladelpar-treated mice, indicating normal glucose handling. Hepatic expression of Cluster of Differentiation 68 (CD68) was decreased with both doses of seladelpar, indicating a beneficial effect on elevated macrophage accumulation. The efficacy of seladelpar 3 mg/kg extended to liver histology, where we observed less hepatocyte ballooning, steatosis, inflammation, and reversal of NASH. Immunohistochemical data showed similar decreased liver fibrosis (Sirius red staining of collagen, and expression of α-SMA) with seladelpar at 3 and 10 mg/kg doses. Conclusion: These findings extend our earlier observations on the effectiveness of seladelpar 10 mg/kg on NASH in the more diabetes-prone foz/foz NOD.B10 strain. Here, we show in mice with C57BL6 background that seladelpar 3 mg/kg appears to exert near equivalent effects on insulin sensitization as the 10 mg/kg dose, with reversal of liver injury, hepatic inflammation, NASH pathology, and fibrosis. The low-dose seladelpar results strengthen the interpretation of PPAR-δ in treating NASH. The PPAR-α agonist (Wy-14643) has similar efficacy, and therefore, studies are underway in PPAR-α(-/-) mice to further explain the roles of PPAR-δ and α with these agents.",,,,L629456790,10.1111/jgh.14798

Here, we retrospectively evaluate the association of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) and hypertension (HTN) with OS and PFS for cabozantinib in the CELESTIAL trial. Methods: A total of 707 patients with aHCC were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive 60-mg cabozantinib or placebo once daily. Eligible patients had Child-Pugh score A, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) ≤ 1, must have received prior sorafenib, and could have received up to two prior regimens of systemic therapy for HCC. OS and PFS with cabozantinib were evaluated for patients with any grade PPE or grade ≥ 3 HTN within the first 8 weeks of study treatment. Results: In the first 8 weeks of treatment, 188 cabozantinib-treated patients (40%) developed any grade PPE versus 11 placebo-treated patients (5%), and 61 cabozantinib-treated patients (13%) developed grade ≥ 3 HTN versus 3 placebo-treated patients (1%). Median OS with cabozantinib was 14.4 months for patients with any grade PPE versus 8.4 months for patients without PPE (hazard ratio [HR], 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.74), and median PFS with cabozantinib was 6.5 months versus 3.7 months, respectively (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.51-0.78).

Date of Publication: 7 Aug 2019","2019","25","29","3870","3896","7 Aug 2019","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for the majority of primary liver cancers. To date, most patients with HCC are diagnosed at an advanced tumor stage, excluding them from potentially curative therapies (i.e., resection, liver transplantation, percutaneous ablation). Treatments with palliative intent include chemoembolization and systemic therapy. Among systemic treatments, the small-molecule multikinase inhibitor sorafenib has been the only systemic treatment available for advanced HCC over 10 years. More recently, other smallmolecule multikinase inhibitors (e.g., regorafenib, lenvatinib, cabozantinib) have been approved for HCC treatment. The promising immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., nivolumab, pembrolizumab) are still under investigation in Europe while in the US nivolumab has already been approved by FDA in sorafenib refractory or resistant patients. Other molecules, such as the selective CDK4/6inhibitors (e.g., palbociclib, ribociclib), are in earlier stages of clinical development, and the c- MET inhibitor tivantinib did not show positive results in a phase III study. However, even if the introduction of targeted agents has led to great advances in patient response and survival with an acceptable toxicity profile, a remarkable inter-individual heterogeneity in therapy outcome persists and constitutes a significant problem in disease management. Thus, the identification of biomarkers that predict which patients will benefit from a specific intervention could significantly affect decision-making and therapy planning. Germ-line variants have been suggested to play an important role in determining outcomes of HCC systemic therapy in terms of both toxicity and treatment efficacy. Particularly, a number of studies have focused on the role of genetic polymorphisms impacting the drug metabolic pathway and membrane translocation as well as the drug mechanism of action as predictive/prognostic markers of HCC treatment. The aim of this review is to summarize and critically discuss the pharmacogenetic literature evidences, with particular attention to sorafenib and regorafenib, which have been used longer than the others in HCC treatment.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00988741, NCT01069757, NCT01356628, NCT01575522, NCT01656265, NCT01658878, NCT01755767, NCT02029157, NCT02524119, NCT02576509, NCT02658019, NCT02702401, NCT02786342, NCT02940496, NCT03062358, NCT03439891, NCT03713593, NCT03753659)",,31413525,L2002715866,10.3748/wjg.v25.i29.3870

The aim of this study was to find which patients can benefit from the triple drugs TACE compared with single-drug TACE. Methods: Patients in the triple-drug TACE arm received sponge embolization and emulsions composed of 50 mg epirubicin, 50 mg lobaplatin, 6 mg mitomycin C, and lipiodol, while patients in the single-drug TACE arm received sponge embolization and emulsions composed of 50 mg epirubicin and lipiodol.

The patients were randomly allocated into the sorafenib group (at a dose of 400 mg twice daily) or the placebo group. Primary outcomes were overall survival and the time to symptomatic progression. Secondary outcomes included the time to radiologic progression and safety. At the second planned interim analysis, 321 deaths had occurred, and the study was stopped. Median overall survival was 10.7 months in the sorafenib group and 7.9 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.87; P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the median time to symptomatic progression (4.1 months vs. 4.9 months, respectively, P=0.77). The median time to radiologic progression was 5.5 months in the sorafenib group and 2.8 months in the placebo group (P<0.001). Seven patients in the sorafenib group (2%) and two patients in the placebo group (1%) had a par- tial response; no patients had a complete response. Diarrhea, weight loss, hand-foot skin reaction, and hypophosphatemia were more frequent in the sorafenib group. SHARP study is the first study demonstrated the efficacy of sorafenib, a molecule-target agent, for advanced HCC by RCT, along with the Asia- Pasific study2). The results of this study have made sorafenib the 1st-line standard treatment for advanced HCC. To date, it is a study that has become the backbone of systemic treatment for advanced HCC. REFLECT study3) This study was an open-label, phase 3, multicenter, non-inferiority trial that recruited patients with unresectable HCC, who had not received treatment for advanced disease, at 154 sites in 20 countries throughout the Asia-Pacific, European, and North American regions. The aim of this study was to compare overall survival in patients treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib as a first-line treatment for unresectable HCC. The primary endpoint was overall survival, measured from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause. The efficacy analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle, and only patients who received treatment were included in the safety analysis. The non-inferiority margin was set at 1.08. 954 eligible patients were randomly assigned to lenvatinib (n=478) or sorafenib (n=476). BCLC-C accounted for 78%, but median survival time for lenvatinib of 13.6 months (95% CI 12.1-14.9) was non-inferior to sorafenib (12.3 months, 10.4-13.9; hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.79-1.06), meeting criteria for non-inferiority. The response rate (m-RECIST) of lenvatinib (40.6%) was significant higher comparing to that in the lenvatinib group (12.4%). The most common any-grade adverse events were hypertension (201 [42%]), diarrhoea (184 [39%]), decreased appetite (162 [34%]), and decreased weight (147 [31%]) for lenvatinib, and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (249 [52%]), diarrhoea (220 [46%]), hypertension (144 [30%]), and decreased appetite (127 [27%]) for sorafenib. Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in untreated advanced HCC. The safety and tolerability profiles of lenvatinib were consistent with those previously observed. REFLECT study demonstrated the non-inferiority of lenvatinib to sorafenib with overall survival as a primary endpoint, and established lenvatinib as the 1st line another standard treatment for advanced HHC similar as sorafenib. RESORCE study4) This study was randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 trial done at 152 sites in 21 countries, adults with HCC who tolerated sorafenib (≥400 mg/day for ≥20 of last 28 days of treatment), progressed on sorafenib, and had Child-Pugh A liver function. The aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in patients with HCC who have progressed during sorafenib treatment. The primary endpoint was overall survival (defined as time from randomisation to death due to any cause. 573 patients were randomly assigned (2:1) (379 to regorafenib and 194 to placebo; population for efficacy analyses), and 567 initiated treatment (374 received regorafenib and 193 received placebo; population for safety analyses). The patients were stratified by geographical region, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, macrovascular invasion, extrahepatic disease, and α-fetoprotein level to best supportive care plus oral regorafenib 160 mg or placebo once daily during weeks 1-3 of each 4-week cycle. Regorafenib improved overall survival with a hazard ratio of 0.63 (95% CI 0.50-0.79; one-sided p<0.0001); median survival was 10.6 months (95% CI 9.1-12.1) for regorafenib versus 7.8 months (6.3-8.8) for placebo. Adverse events were reported in all regorafenib recipients (374 [100%] of 374) and 179 (93%) of 193 placebo recipients. The most common clinically relevant grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent events were hypertension (57 patients [15%] in the regorafenib group vs nine patients [5%] in the placebo group), hand-foot skin reaction (47 patients [13%] vs one [1%]), fatigue (34 patients [9%] vs nine patients [5%]), and diarrhoea (12 patients [3%] vs no patients). RESORCE study demonstrated the efficacy of regorafenib in placebocontrolled randomized study for patients who progressed on sorafenib treatment, and successfully positioned regoraphene as a 2nd-line treatment for advanced HCC. However, because regorafenib is similar profile of toxic events to sorafenib, sorafenib intolerant cases are not targeted. This trial showed that OS of sorafenib-regorafenib sequential treatment was 26 months after the initiation of sorafenib. This OS was comparable to the outcome of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), so it suggested that systemic treatment has the possibility of affecting the indication of TACE. CELESTIAL study5) This study was a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial to evaluate cabozantinib as compared with placebo in previously treated patients with advanced HCC. Eligible patients had received previous treatment with sorafenib, had disease progression after at least one systemic treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, and might have received up to two previous systemic regimens. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points were progression-free survival and the objective response rate. 707 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive cabozantinib (60 mg once daily) or matching placebo. At the second planned interim analysis, the trial showed significantly longer overall survival with cabozantinib than with placebo. Median overall survival was 10.2 months with cabozantinib and 8.0 months with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.92; P=0.005). Median progression-free survival was 5.2 months with cabozantinib and 1.9 months with placebo (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.52; P<0.001), and the objective response rates were 4% and less than 1%, respectively (P=0.009). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 68% of patients in the cabozantinib group and in 36% in the placebo group. The most common high-grade events were palmarplantar erythro-dysesthesia (17% with cabozantinib vs. 0% with placebo), hypertension (16% vs. 2%), increased aspartate aminotransferase level (12% vs. 7%), fatigue (10% vs. 4%), and diarrhea (10% vs. 2%). CELESTIAL study demonstrated the efficacy of cabosantinib against placebo for patients who were refractory or intolerant of sorafenib, and cabosantinib was another 2nd-line (or 3rd-line) treatment similar as regorafenib.",,,,L629258365,10.1007/s00270-019-02282-x

Lusutrombopag is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist approved in Japan and US for treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD undergoing invasive procedures. We assessed efficacy and safety of lusutrombopag in patients with HCC and those with other CLD diagnoses. Material and methods: This integrated analysis incorporated data from 2 Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (L-PLUS 1; L-PLUS 2). Adults with CLD and baseline platelet counts (PC) <50x109/L received lusutrombopag 3 mg once daily or placebo for ≤7 days prior to an invasive procedure scheduled 9-14 days after randomization. Platelet transfusion (PT) was mandated for pre-procedure PC <50x109/L. Efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients (per-protocol population) who required no PT prior to procedure and no rescue therapy for bleeding from randomization through 7 days post-procedure. Results: Of 312 randomized patients, 270 comprised the per-protocol population (95 HCC; 175 other CLD). The efficacy endpoint was met for 68.0% (34/50) of HCC patients who received lusutrombopag vs 8.9% (4/45) who received placebo, compared to 77.0% (67/87) and 21.6% (19/88), respectively, among patients with other forms of CLD. In HCC patients, PCs remained >50x109/L for a median 16.6 days with lusutrombopag vs 3.8 days with placebo. One patient treated with lusutrombopag experienced treatment-emergent portal vein thrombosis but never exceeded PC >200x109/L. Conclusion: Lusutrombopag was similarly efficacious in managing thrombocytopenia in patients with HCC, as well as other forms of CLD, undergoing invasive procedures.",,,,L629258837,10.1007/s00270-019-02282-x

But we have now a total of 7 drugs in this indication. The success of molecular targeted therapy (MTT) and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), and in particular various promising combinations of these agents, has spurred the pursuit of highly efficacious regimens that may hike the tumor response rate to 30-50% and median overall survival to 15-20 months for advanced HCC. However, before these can be mingled into our daily practice, the problems of the accompanied toxicities should be reasonable solved. When efficacious systemic therapy for HCC is available, it is reasonable to ask whether it can also benefit patients with earlier-stage diseases. Several phase III trials are now testing ICI or ICI-containg combinations in adjuvant setting for high-risk resected/ablated patients. The latter refers to patients who receive surgery or ablation beyond the BCLC boundary, a practice that has already been widely accepted in Asian countries. HCC has now rejoined all other cancer types, for which adjuvant therapy is given primarily to those who have high risk of recurrence after curative treatment. We have also observed a higher quality of tumor remission in ICI responders. Durable remission is common, and thus residual primary tumors or oligometastases may benefit from further resection or loco-regional therapy. A muti-disciplinary team has become more and more important even in cases with advanced diseases. In conclusion, systemic therapy for HCC has evolved rapidly from literally nothing to burgeoning prosperity, and is poised o change the treatment paradigm for all stages of diseases.",,,,L644051619,10.1159/000502497

The A first-in-class approved immune checkpoint inhibitor is ipilimumab, which is a fully humanized mAb that blocks the immunosuppressive signal by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4. In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of ipilimumab for the treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma. Then, nivolumab, which is a humanized mAb that blocks programmed death-1 (PD-1), was approved for use in the treatment of advanced melanoma in 2014 and of advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in 2015 in Japan. Pembrolizumab, which is another anti- PD-1 antibody, was approved for use in the treatment of advanced melanoma and advanced NSCLC as the first-line therapy in 2016 in Japan. Thereafter, nivolumab was also approved for use in the treatment of advanced renal cell cancer in August 2016, of Hodgkin's lymphoma in December 2016, and of head and neck cancer in March 2017 in Japan. Moreover, phase III trials of anti-PD-1 mAb and anti-PD-ligand 1 mAb for use in the treatment of cancers, such as gastric, ovarian, bladder, and esophageal cancers, are ongoing. Several clinical trials have investigated new agents, alone and in combination, for use in the treatment of various cancers including Hepatocellular carcinoma. Current advances in tumor immunology have unveiled the importance of immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and tumor-associated macrophages, especially in a tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent data suggest the inhibition of immunosuppressive cells and the cytokines related to them activate and infiltrate cytotoxic T cells and in TME, which could be one of the next combination strategies.

To confirm the benefits of PD-1 antibody, a number of phase III clinical trials have been designed to directly compare PD-1 antibody to sorafenib in first-line setting, or to placebo in the second-line setting. However, the enthusiasm was cooled down a bit by recent results of phase III clinical trials. In the lecture, I shall go over potential reasons explaining the difficulty in obtaining positive results in phase III clinical trials on PD-1 antibody in HCC.

Date of Publication: 1 Aug 2019","2019","8",,"58",,"1 Aug 2019","Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are now a standard of care therapy in first line and beyond for hepatocellular carcinoma. This is based in successful overall survival outcome in multiple phase III clinical trials for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. After the advent of sorafenib more than a decade ago, four new tyrosine kinase inhibitors, lenvatinib in first line, regorafenib in second line after progression on sorafenib, cabozantinib beyond progression, and ramucirumab in patients with alpha fetoprotein greater than or equal to 400 ng/mL, have shown positive outcomes and several have already been established as approved standards of care and others way are on the way. The question remains on how to select among those agents. Checkpoint inhibitors e.g. nivolumab and pembrolizumab have also shown and gained conditional approval for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma based on improved and extended response rates. Yet both have been reported to fail to show an improvement in overall survival in first line (nivolumab) and second line (pembrolizumab). While one may wonder if the nivolumab versus sorafenib in first line setting could be expected to fail considering that patients on the sorafenib arm may be treated with a checkpoint inhibitor later on, but how about pembrolizumab versus placebo in second line setting? Would the answer be in a patient selection, more precise sequencing, or simply we need to explore further options of combining different checkpoint inhibitors like tremelimumab and durvalumab in the Himalaya Study, and/or the addition of checkpoint inhibitors to anti-angiogenic agents or tyrosine kinase inhibitors like pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib among many others.",,,,L644051709,10.1159/000502497

OR rates for LEN vs SOR were: 24% vs 9% by investigator review and 41% vs 12% by independent review (Kudo M et al, Lancet, 2018). As the relationship between OR and OS in phase 3 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) studies is unclear, we explored the relationship between OR and OS in REFLECT. Methods: OR assessed by investigators per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) was used to analyze the association between OR and OS of patients treated with LEN or SOR. The median OS of responders (with complete response or partial response) was compared to that of nonresponders (with stable disease, progressive disease, or unknown/not evaluable) irrespective of treatment. Landmark analyses were performed by OR status at several fixed time points as sensitivity analyses, and the effect on OS was evaluated by Cox regression with OR as a time-dependent covariate with other prognostic factors. Results: Median OS was 22.4 months for responders and 11.4 months for nonresponders. Hazard ratios (HR) of landmark analyses at 2, 4, and 6 months were 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.98), 0.72 (95% CI, 0.56-0.92), and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.57-0.93), respectively.

Date of Publication: 1 Aug 2019","2019","8",,"76",,"1 Aug 2019","Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a widely recommended treatment strategy for the intermediate-stage HCC. Treatment with TACE for intermediate-stage HCC is expected more than 2.5 years of survival. However, only few patients are expected to be completely cured with TACE and most need additional procedures. Palliatively repeated TACE may not only promotes resistance to TACE, but also leads to the deterioration of liver function. The timing of conversion from TACE to sorafenib had been discussed repeatedly in Japan. The Japan Society of Hepatology (JSH) and the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan (LCSGJ) proposed a clear definition of 'refractoriness or failure to TACE'. Several studies in Japan validated that the conversion from TACE to sorafenib immediately after refractoriness to TACE is acceptable in terms of prolongation of overall survival. Recently, several guidelines have recommended that patients with intermediate-stage HCC are eligible for systemic therapy in the case of TACE treatment failure and refractoriness. AS for the next step, Intermediate-stage HCC is a largely heterogeneous disease that includes a subgroup of patients who do not benefit from TACE. The treatment strategy for this subgroup of patients currently remains an unmet need in clinical practice. The efficacy of combination therapy with TACE plus sorafenib (TACTICS trial) for the intermediate-stage was firstly demonstrated at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers (ASCO-GI) Symposium in 2018. In the TACTICS trial, PFS was significantly longer with TACE plus sorafenib than with TACE alone (25.2 months vs. 13.5 months).

Date of Publication: 1 Aug 2019","2019","8",,"77","78","1 Aug 2019","Hepatocellular carcinoma shows a rising incidence in the Western world. The majority of diagnoses is made in advanced tumor stages when therapeutic options are limited. Despite significant efforts to develop and evaluate active compounds for systemic treatment in several randomized trials, to date only five drugs, sorafenib and lenvatinib in first-line, and regorafenib and cabozantinib in second-line, have been approved in Europe based on survival advantages in phase III clinical trials. In 2008 the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib was the first systemic compound demonstrated to improve overall survival of patients with advanced HCC. Sorafenib acts by targeting multiple oncogenic signaling molecules (i.e., VEGF, PDFGF, CKIT, BRAF) in cancer cells as well as the tumor microenvironment. Since 2017 several phase III studies led to approval of new tyrosine kinase inhibitors in first and second-line settings. In 2016, the RESORCE trial assessing the efficacy and safety of regorafenib vs. placebo in patients who tolerated but progressed on sorafenib demonstrated a significantly improved time to progression (3.2 months vs. 1.5 months) as well as overall survival (10.6 months vs. 7.8 months) for patients treated with regorafenib. More recently, in a randomized, open-label, phase III study, the multityrosine kinase inhibitor lenvatinib, which targets VEGFR1-3, FGFR1-4, PDGFRα, RET, and KIT, was compared to sorafenib for unresectable HCC. This non-inferiority trial demonstrated a similar overall survival (13.6 months vs. 12.1 months; not significant) despite a significant increase in time to progression for lenvatinib (8.9 months vs. 3.7 months; p <0.00001) in selected patients with less than 50% liver occupation, without obvious invasion of the bile duct, or invasion at the main portal vein. In the second line setting, positive results from the phase III CELESTIAL trial, evaluating the multikinase-inhibitor, cabozantinib, in patients, who progressed on sorafenib, confirmed a prolonged overall survival (10.2 months vs. 8.0 months) and median progression free survival rates (5.2 vs. 1.9 months) compared to placebo. Besides these new multi-kinase-inhibitors with demonstrated clinical activity, the recent phase III REACH-2 study evaluating the efficacy of the monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor, ramucirumab in advanced HCC for the first time depicted a rational for a biomarker driven therapeutic approach: After failure of the original REACH phase III study in unselected patients, the trial evaluated ramucirumab in patients with an elevated (>400 ng/ml) alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level (NCT02435433) and confirmed improved overall survival in a second line setting. In addition to TKIs, immune-oncological treatment strategies have entered the arena of HCC. Several clinical trials evaluate the efficacy of antibodies against PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 both as mono-therapy as well as in combinatorial therapy approaches in patients with advanced HCC. The checkmate 040 phase II dose escalation and expansion trial for patients with advanced HCCs suggested safety and efficacy of the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab. Objective response rates of 15-20% were reached in patient cohorts including metastatic disease and previous treatment with sorafenib. Nivolumab could be used safely in uninfected and hepatitis C virus (HCV)- and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected HCC patients. The disease control rate reached 64% (95% confidence interval (CI) 58-71%) and the objective response rate was 20% (95% CI 15-26%) including 3 complete responses and 39 partial responses. Remarkable was a 9-month overall survival rate of 74% (95% CI 67-79%). Similar results have also been shown for other checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab and durvalumab alone or in combination with tremelimumab. In the KEYNOTE-224 study, mOS was similar to nivolumab in the second line at 12.9 months with a disease control rate of 61% and ORR of 18%. Based on these findings, nivolumab and pembrolizumab were approved by the FDA for second-line therapy of advanced HCC. Very recently, pembrolizumab was evaluated in the KEYNOTE-240 phase III study in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), who were previously treated with systemic therapy, compared to placebo plus best supportive care (NCT02702401). The study did not meet its co-primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The negative results of this first phase III study of immune-therapy in HCC call into doubt general use of checkpoint-inhibition in unselected patients with advanced stages of the disease. Furthermore, according to a recent press release the checkmate 459 trial, investigating nivolumab against Sorafenib did not reach the pre-specified level of superiority in OS. Several trials currently investigate different combinations of IOs, TKIs and anti-angiogenic antibodies.",,,,L644051927,10.1159/000502497

TACE therapy achieves tumor responses, but recurrence is common and often occurs within 1 year. Early evidence shows encouraging activity and durable clinical response for checkpoint inhibitors (CIs), such as durvalumab, as treatment for advanced HCC and combined with TACE. CIs combined with VEGF inhibitors also show promise in advanced HCC. Taken together, combining durvalumab, VEGF inhibitors, and TACE therapies warrants evaluation in patients with locoregional HCC. EMERALD-1 (NCT03778957) is a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multicenter Phase 3 study assessing efficacy and safety for durvalumab monotherapy when given with either drug-eluting bead (DEB)-TACE or conventional TACE (cTACE) followed by durvalumab± bevacizumab in patients with HCC not amenable to curative therapy.

However, patients with the liver tumor volume greater than 50% of the whole liver and with main portal vein tumor thrombus, that often exists in clinical practice, excluded in REFLECT trial. This study aimed to examine the safety and efficacy of lenvatinib to the patients which beyond REFLECT study indications in a real-world setting. Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center, observational study, that observed unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma patients with the tumor accounted for more than 50% of the liver volume or with main portal vein tumor thrombus. Participants were observed for at least 12 weeks. Therapeutic effect was determined using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (m-RECIST) at the 12th week. Results: 21 patients were observed in this study. Fatigue, leukopenia and dysphoria were the most frequent AEs. Leukopenia, hand-foot skin reaction and decreased appetite were the most frequent AEs which were higher than Grade 2. 7 of these patients had elevated Child- Pugh scores and 3 of whom increased from Child-Pugh A to B. All of the AEs could be controlled by appropriate dose reduction, interruption, and symptomatic treatment. No liver function failure occured. The probability of tumor marker (AFP or PIVKA-II) decline was 100% and 60% at 1 month and 3 months after administration, respectively. In the m-RECIST evaluation at the 12th week, 0, 7, 7, and 7 patients had achieved complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease, respectively.

Date of Publication: 1 Aug 2019","2019","8",,"38",,"1 Aug 2019","Since it was demonstrated that the efficacy of sorafenib in prolonging the survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), various treatment agents have been investigated in large phase III trials. In the first-line treatment, lenvatinib, which is a similar multi-kinase inhibitor (MKI) targeting VEGFR, PDGFR and FGFR, was also demonstrated to show non-inferiority to sorafenib in terms of the overall survival in the REFLECT trial. Lenvatinib was approved for the treatment of HCC in 2018 in Japan. Regorafenib, which is a similar MKI to sorafenib, targeting VEGFR, PDGFR and Raf, was shown to provide survival benefit as compared to placebo as the second-line treatment after sorafenib in the RESORCE trial. Regorafenib was also approved in 2017. Furthermore, cabozantinib, a MKI targeting VEGFR and MET, and ramucirumab, an anti-VGFR-2 antibody, were demonstrated to prolong the survival as in second-line treatment agents in the CELESTIAL trial and the REACH-2 trial, respectively. In the near future, therefore, 5 agents would become available for the treatment of advanced HCC. Intra-hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is commonly used for the treatment of advanced HCC in Japan, especially HCC with extensive vascular invasion and/or massive type HCC tumors. However, to date, the survival benefit of HAIC has not been confirmed in a prospective clinical trial. Combination of sorafenib with HAIC using low dose 5-FU and cisplatin failed to demonstrate the prolongation of the overall survival comparing to sorafenib alone in the phase III trial (the SILIUS trial). On the other hand, combined use of sorafenib with HAIC using cisplatin was examined in a randomized phase II trial, and promising results in terms of the overall survival were reported. A phase II trial of combined use of lenvatnib with HAIC is currently under way. Recent advances in the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have dramatically changed the cancer treatment paradigms for many cancer types. Various ICIs such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab are under investigation in phase III trials for HCC. The response rate to ICI monotherapy is around 20% and durable duration has been shown in phase II trials. Furthermore, combined use of ICIs with other agents, including molecular-targeted agents or CTLA-4 inhibitors, especially combined use with antiangiogenic agents, including bevacizumb or MKIs, have been demonstrated to yield high response rates of around 40%. As a result, various combination treatments are currently under investigation in phase III trials.",,,,L644052015,10.1159/000502497

Date of Publication: 1 Aug 2019","2019","8",,"39",,"1 Aug 2019","The age-standardized mortality and incidence rates of primary liver cancer appear to be declining in South Korea; however, the absolute number of patients associated with primary liver cancer mortality are still increasing. In South Korea, the mortality rate of primary liver cancer is the second highest across all age groups. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is most common cancer (approximately 85%) of primary liver cancer. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the predominant etiology of HCC in Korea and according to several retrospective studies, HBV accounted for 62∼75% of HCC. A substantial proportion of Korean patients with HCC are diagnosed at an advanced stage; more than 35% of patients had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer C or D stage tumors at the time of diagnosis. Sorafenib is the standard of care in the management of advanced HCC. Recently, lenvatinib is available for those patients but there is no proven second-line treatment after lenvatinib failure, so it is difficult to use lenvatinib in National Health Insurance System of Korea. A retrospective observational study based on national health insurance data (2008-2014) showed that the mean duration of sorafenib administration was 106 days and initial sorafenib dose was 600-800 mg in 71% of patients. The most commonly applied treatment after sorafenib failure was TACE but this sequence is changing after availability of regorafenib and nivolumab as a secondline treatment. Recently, a multicenter prospective study showed the median overall survival 10.8 months with sorafenib treatment in patients with far advanced HCC. A multicenter retrospective observational study of regorafenib after progression on sorafenib in Korean patients with HCC reported that the median progression-free survival was 3.7 months and the 1 year OS rate was 54.6%. 2018 Korean Liver Cancer Association-National Cancer Center Korea Practice Guidelines for the Management of Hepatocellular Carcinoma recommended sorafenib and lenvatinib as a first-line systemic treatment, and regorafenib, nivolumab, cabozantinib and ramucirumab as a second-line systemic treatment for patients with advanced HCC. In recent phase 3 studies, both nivolumab and pembrolizumab failed to reach the primary objectives, but the acceptable safety profiles of the immunotherapeutic agents warrant the exploration of combination therapy. The treatment paradigm for patients with unresectable HCC is evolving and it will be important to develop optimal strategies for sequencing or combining systemic agents.

Date of Publication: 1 Aug 2019","2019","8",,"41",,"1 Aug 2019","With the advent of Sorafenib systemic therapy became a treatment option in patients with unresectable HCC. However, in clinical reality the majority of these patients never received systemic therapy and, conversely, even in advanced stage transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) remained a competitor to systemic therapy, despite guideline recommendations. Moreover, impressive regional differences in treatment patterns showed a certain level of arbitrariness. Over the recent years several TKIs have been approved in addition to sorafenib: lenvatinib in first-line, and regorafenib and cabozantinib in secondline, based on survival advantages in phase III clinical trials. Moreover, the antiangiogenic antibody ramucirumab has been added to our therapeutic armamentarium. Furthermore, immune-oncological agents are available in some parts of the World, although the data currently are conflicting. Nevertheless, the spectrum of systemic therapy has dramatically evolved over the last ten years and even data, although sparse, for third-line therapy exist. In view of this extended spectrum of systemic therapy and with the knowledge that TACE may interfere with liver function in a way rendering the patient untreatable with systemic agents, several questions need to be reassessed: 1. In which stage do we use systemic therapy as first option? 2. When do we switch from TACE to systemic therapy? 3. Given multiple options, how do we choose first and second line? The presentation will cover these points and extend on the ongoing discussion on the general role of systemic therapy in HCC.",,,,L644052049,10.1159/000502497

Date of Publication: 1 Aug 2019","2019","8",,"43",,"1 Aug 2019","Surgical treatment is a potentially curative treatment option for primary liver cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) nd intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). However, many of the patients treated with surgery experience disease progression. Moreover, many patients present with unresectable disease at diagnosis. In such cases, until recently, available treatment options have been very limited in efficacy, which led to dismal survival rates. More recent developments in oncology have offered renewed hope for advanced cancer patients. Hypofractionated radiation has shown feasibility and promise in unresectable HCC and ICC setting, and is now being tested in a randomized phase III trial in HCC (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03186898). Antiangiogenic agents have strongly impacted the management of advanced HCC, with multiple drug options in first line setting (sorafenib, lenvatinib) and second line setting (regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab). Notably, immunotherapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies has shown real potential to transform advanced GI cancer therapy, both in first line and second line settings. Finally, combinations of these new strategies are very attractive approaches, as they promise durable and profound responses in advanced GI cancers. In order to fulfill this promise, these concepts require greater understanding based on mechanistic preclinical studies and validation in correlative studies in clinical trials as a basis to establish optimal combinatorial strategies. I will present results from clinical correlative studies and preclinical models of these diseases performed at our institution. This “bench-tothe- bedside and back” approach raise the hope for a more efficient development of targeted agents in advanced setting.",,,,L644052089,10.1159/000502497

REACH-22 and REACH3 showed significant survival benefits of RAM treatment for HCC in patients (pts) with baseline AFP ≧400 ng/mL. We conducted a pooled subgroup analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of RAM in Asian and non-Asian pts from REACH-2 and REACH (high AFP subpopulation). Methods: Pts were randomized to receive RAM 8 mg/kg IV or placebo (PL) once every two weeks, plus best supportive care, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression were performed for OS and PFS. Efficacy analyses were stratified by study. Results: Across the two studies, 291 Asian pts were randomized to RAM (168) or PL (123); 251 non-Asian pts were randomized to RAM (148) or PL (103). Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between treatment arms in Asian and non-Asian pts. RAM significantly improved median OS and PFS in both Asian pts and non-Asian pts (Table). The results of ORR and DCR are shown in the table. The most common grade ≧3 adverse event occurring in the RAM arm of Asian and non-Asian pts was hypertension (7.7% and 16.9%, respectively).

Methods: To determine whether the simpler urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) calculated from spot urine samples could be accurately used for proteinuria monitoring in patients receiving lenvatinib, we evaluated the correlation between UPCR and 24-hour urine protein results from the phase 3 REFLECT study. Paired data (323 tests, 154 patients) were analysed. Results: Regression analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between UPCR and 24-hour urine protein (R(2): 0.75; P < 2 × 10(−16)). A UPCR cut-off value of 2.4 had 96.9% sensitivity, 82.5% specificity for delineating between grade 2 and 3 proteinuria. Using this UPCR cut-off value to determine the need for further testing could reduce the need for 24-hour urine collection in ~74% of patients.

However, survival varies widely from under three months to over two years. The aim of this study was to build a statistical model that allows personalised survival prediction following sorafenib treatment. Methods: We had access to 1130 patients undergoing sorafenib treatment for aHCC as part of the control arm for two phase III randomised clinical trials (RCTs). A multivariable model was built that predicts survival based on baseline clinical features. The statistical approach permits both group-level risk stratification and individual-level survival prediction at any given time point. The model was calibrated, and its discrimination assessed through Harrell’s c-index and Royston-Sauerbrei’s R(2)(D). Results: The variables influencing overall survival were vascular invasion, age, ECOG score, AFP, albumin, creatinine, AST, extra-hepatic spread and aetiology. The model-predicted survival very similar to that observed. The Harrell’s c-indices for training and validation sets were 0.72 and 0.70, respectively indicating good prediction.

Methods: Major eligibility criteria include histologically confirmed unresectable, HCC patients with Child-Pugh Class A or B liver function. Total of 70 advanced HCC patients were enrolled and administrated with 600 mg b.i.d. Primary endpoints were TTP, and secondary endpoints were safety, OS, and DCR. Local disease control was defined as no progressive disease (PD) by RECIST. Kaplan-Meier analysis was utilized for OS assessment. Inflammation-Immune biomarkers NLR, PLR, cytokines, baseline expression of checkpoint/immune gene panel including PD-L1/L2, TIM3, IDO, HLA were evaluated by Nanostring and NGS technologies, retrospectively. Results: There was no = grade III drug related AE observed in all enrolled 70 advanced HCC patients. Objective response evaluation in per-protocol population showed PR (1.6%), SD (32.8%) and PD (59.0%) and median overall survival (OS) 254day (95% CI, 172-296). DCR was achieved 34.4% (95% CI, 22.7-47.7%); Median OS for the PD-L1- positive (n=9) and negative (n=24) subgroups were 389 (95% CI, 80-522) vs. 286.5days (95%CI, 135-482), for IL-6-advantage (n=28) and disadvantage (n=16) subgroups were 328.5 (95% CI, 277-566) vs. 168 days (95% CI, 135-482), for IL-8 low (n=22) and high (n=22) subgroups were 475.5(95% CI, 309-NA) vs. 175days (95% CI, 135-295), respectively. Overall survival was significantly associated with patient genetic profiles such as neo-antigen, bacterial and viral DNA inserts. Conclusion: Icaritin has demonstrated its favorable clinical safety and preliminary immune-modulation efficacy. Potential baseline immune biomarkers to predict the improved OS were suggested including immune cell PD-L1 expression, low level peripheral IL-8, PLR, neoantigen and infection-associated genetic variations. Both safety and immuneresponse efficacy are warranted for the further Phase III validation.",,,,L628859130,10.1158/1538-7445.SABCS18-CT148

Recently, lenvatinib was demonstrated noninferior to sorafenib, and regorafenib and ramucirumab were demonstrated superior to placebo in patients progressing on sorafenib and in patients with elevated α-fetoprotein-failing sorafenib, respectively. Phase I-II trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors reported promising efficacy signals. Recently, the randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase III CELESTIAL trial demonstrated statistically and clinically significant increase in overall survival from 8 months with placebo to 10.2 months with cabozantinib in patients failing sorafenib. Furthermore, the study showed a significant improvement in all the efficacy end points. Main adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, hypertension, increased aspartate aminotransferase, fatigue and diarrhea. Over the past 10 years, sorafenib, an antiangiogenic drug acting as a multikinase inhibitor, has been the only systemic agent approved for first-line treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite several disappointing results, in patients-failing sorafenib, other compounds with similar (but not overlapping) properties have been recently shown to prolong survival, thereby confirming the role of a sustained antiangiogenic inhibition in further lines of treatment. Here, we will discuss data on cabozantinib, which displays both antiangiogenic- and MET-inhibiting properties, and was reported in 2018 to increase survival in the context of second- and third-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.",,,31204849,L628862973,10.2217/fon-2019-0026

In a recent phase 3 clinical trial in unresectable HCC (REFLECT study), LEN showed statistical non-inferiority of OS compared to sorafenib (SOR) and clinically meaningful outcome in ORR, PFS, and TTP. We previously showed LEN decreased in vitro proliferation of HCC cells with activated FGF signaling pathways, and inhibited tumor FGF signal and angiogenesis. However, it is largely still unknown that the contribution of FGFR inhibition on tumor cells to the antitumor activity of LEN in addition to antiangiogenic activity. In this study, we investigated the role of tumor FGF signaling pathway in human HCC cells under nutrient-poor condition to mimic tumor environment induced by anti-angiogenesis. Methods: LEN, SOR or the corresponding vehicle were given orally to mice bearing Hep3B2.1-7 xenograft tumors for 7 days. The tumor sections were stained with H & E, and analyzed histologically. To evaluate the roles of FGF signaling pathway in cell deaths of HCC in vitro, HCC cells were treated with LEN, FGFR1-3 specific inhibitors E7090, or MEK inhibitor PD0325901 under nutrient-starved condition, and cell death induction was assessed. The phosphorylation status of downstream molecules of FGFRs and PARP cleavage were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Results: LEN (10 and 30 mg/kg) and SOR (30mg/kg) significantly increased focal necrotic area compared to vehicle treated Hep3B2.1-7 xenograft tumors by histological analysis. LEN increased focal necrotic area in a dose dependent manner. 10 mg/kg LEN increased focal necrotic area more than 30 mg/kg SOR, although antiangiogenic activity was not different. Under nutrient-starved condition in vitro, LEN and E7090 significantly increased death of Hep3B2.1-7 and HuH-7 cells, harboring FGF19 overexpression, but not SOR, which does not inhibit FGFR. LEN and E7090 clearly decreased the phosphorylation of downstream molecules (FRS2 and Erk) in HCC cell lines, and then LEN and E7090 also increased PARP cleavage under nutrient-starved condition. MEK inhibitor PD0325901 induced cell death and PARP cleavage in Hep3B2.1-7 and HuH-7 under nutrient-starved condition. Conclusion: FGF signaling pathway plays a key role in survival of HCC cells under nutrient-starved condition, and inhibition of FGF signaling pathway by LEN or E7090 induced HCC cell death through FGFR-MAPK-PARP cleavage.

The aim of this work is to study whether TTFields' safety profile is maintained in the torso, and specifically in tissues with high cellular proliferation rates. TTFields (2-3 V/cm) were applied for 2 weeks using the Novo-TTF 100 system to the rat torso at 150 and 200 kHz, intensities and frequencies known to be effective for the treatment of NSCLC, mesothelioma, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Throughout the treatment course, all animals underwent daily clinical examination by a certified experienced veterinarian. At the end of treatment, animal were euthanized and an experienced independent pathologist performed histological comparative evaluation of all major internal organs. No changes in the following parameters were observed: Activity level, food intake, drinking, stools, motor neurological status and respiration. Further, no changes in weight were observed between the treated and control groups. No significant changes were observed in complete blood count and differential between the different groups. Histological analysis did not reveal any increase in pathological findings in the TTFields treated animals group.

This group is the second most common type of primary liver cancer. Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms, which may be heterogeneous, and nonspecific biomarkers in serum and biopsy specimens, as well as on imaging techniques. Endoscopy-based diagnosis is essential, since it enables biopsy specimens to be taken. In addition, it can help with locoregional staging of distal tumors. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is a key technique for the evaluation and treatment of malignant biliary tumors. Correct staging of cholangiocarcinoma is essential in order to be able to determine the degree of resectability and assess the results of treatment. The tumor is staged based on the TNM classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. The approach will depend on the classification of the tumor. Thus, some patients with early-stage disease could benefit from surgery; complete surgical resection is the cornerstone of cure. However, only a minority of patients are diagnosed in the early stages and are suitable candidates for resection. In the subset of patients diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease, chemotherapy has been used to improve outcome and to delay tumor progression.

Effective adjuvant therapy has not been demonstrated to date and the prevention and/or delay of recurrence of HCC after curative treatment presents a high unmet medical need. Adjuvant therapy given after resection or ablation has the potential to reduce the risk of relapse and is an effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of many solid tumors. There is encouraging evidence that adjuvant therapy involving agents that engage the immune response, including immunotherapy such as durvalumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody), can prolong recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with early-stage HCC (Yin et al 2013, Huang et al 2015, Xu et al 2015, Lee et al 2015).

Methods: Approximately 888 patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to either Arm A (durvalumab + bevacizumab), Arm B (durvalumab+ placebo), or Arm C (placebo + placebo) following hepatic resection and ablation. Patients will be stratified based upon evidence of pathological microvascular invasion (assessed at study entry) and geographic region.

REACH (NCT01140347) and REACH-2 (NCT02435433) studied ramucirumab (anti-VEGFR2 antibody) in patients with HCC following sorafenib, and REACH-2 only enrolled patients with baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥400 ng/mL. REACH-2 met its primary endpoint of overall survival for ramucirumab treatment compared to placebo. Here we present post-hoc analyses of outcomes by prior TACE treatment in the pooled population of patients from REACH-2 and REACH (AFP ≥400 ng/mL). Methods: Patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh A, ECOG PS 0-1, with progression or intolerance to sorafenib, were randomised in REACH (1:1) or REACH-2 (2:1) to receive ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo Q2W. Pooled individual patient data of REACH-2 and REACH patients with AFP ≥400 ng/mL were analysed (stratified by study) by prior TACE treatments (none, one, ≥1, ≥2). Overall survival (OS) and progression- free survival (PFS) were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model. Prior TACE subgroup-by-treatment interaction was tested using the Wald test from the Stratified Cox model. Results: Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar between treatment arms in prior TACE (n=302) and non-TACE (n=240) patients. Overall, 179 (56.6%) patients in the ramucirumab arm and 123 (54.4%) in the placebo arm had received prior TACE, with a median of 1 treatment in both arms. In patients who received prior TACE, 65.6% received 1 treatment and 34.4% received ≥2 treatments. Regional differences were noted, with increased prevalence and frequency of prior TACE treatment in Asia compared to Western countries (75.2% Japan, 69.8% Asia [except Japan], 38.5% Western countries). Median duration of disease, defined as the time from initial diagnosis to randomisation, was 24 months in prior TACE and 11 months in non-TACE treated patients. Efficacy was similar between TACE and non- TACE subgroups (OS interaction p-value = 0.948). In patients who received prior TACE, ramucirumab treatment improved OS compared to placebo (median 8.2 vs 5.2 months; HR 0.687; 95% CI, 0.530-0.890) and PFS (median 2.8 vs 1.5 months; HR 0.557; 95% CI, 0.432-0.719). Similarly, in non-TACE patients, ramucirumab treatment also improved OS compared to placebo (median 7.7 vs 5.0 months; HR 0.705; 95% CI, 0.524-0.950) and PFS (median 2.8 vs 1.6 months; HR 0.583; 95%, CI 0.431-0.787). Analyses of OS and PFS hazard ratios by total number of TACE treatments (0, 1, ≥1, ≥2) all favored ramucirumab compared to placebo (OS HR range 0.656-0.766; PFS HR range 0.432-0.644). Hypertension was the most frequently reported Grade ≥3 treatment- emergent adverse event in patients who received ramucirumab compared to placebo in both prior TACE (12.3% vs 3.3%) and non-TACE (13.1% vs 4.0%) groups, respectively.

In the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial (NCT01908426), cabozantinib, an inhibitor of MET, VEGFR, and AXL, significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progressionfree survival (PFS) versus placebo in patients with previously treated HCC and is now approved for patients with HCC who have received prior sorafenib. Here we evaluate clinical outcomes based on ALBI grade in the CELESTIAL trial. Methods: 707 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive cabozantinib (60 mg daily) or placebo. Eligible patients had a pathologic diagnosis of HCC, Child-Pugh score A, and ECOG PS≤1. Patients received prior sorafenib and≤2 lines of prior systemic therapy for HCC. ALBI score at baseline was calculated from serum albumin and total bilirubin measured centrally and ALBI grade was determined by the calculated score (Johnson, 2015). Results: At baseline 186 patients (40%) were ALBI grade 1 and 282 patients (60%) were ALBI grade 2 in the cabozantinib arm. One hundred and two patients (43%) were ALBI grade 1 and 133 patients (56%) were ALBI grade 2 in the placebo arm. Two patients in each arm were ALBI grade 3. Patients with ALBI grade 1 had better ECOG PS (61% ECOG 0 & 39% ECOG 1) versus those with ALBI grade 2 (48% ECOG 0 & 52% ECOG 1).

The most common grade 3/4 adverse events in both groups were consistent with those in the overall population. Treatment-related discontinuations in the cabozantinib arm were 12% for patients with ALBI grade 1 and 19% for those with ALBI grade 2. Conclusion: Patients treated with cabozantinib had longer PFS and OS compared to patients receiving placebo, regardless of ALBI grade.

Methods: Approximately 888 pts will be randomized 1:1:1 to either Arm A (durvalumab+ bevacizumab), Arm B (durvalumab+ placebo), or Arm C (placebo + placebo) following hepatic resection and ablation. Patients will be stratified based upon evidence of pathological microvascular invasion (assessed at study entry) and geographic region. Eligible pts must have confirmed HCC and have successfully completed curative therapy (resection or ablation) with imaging to confirm disease-free status ≤28 days prior to randomization, ECOG 0-1 and Child-Pugh score of 5 or 6. Patients will not be included in the study if they have known fibrolamellar HCC, sarcomatoid HCC or mixed cholangiocarcinoma and HCC, or any evidence of metastatic, macrovascular invasion or co-existing malignant disease on baseline imaging. Any patients with evidence of portal vein thrombosis or those on a waiting list for liver transplantation will be excluded. Prior systemic anticancer therapy for HCC is not allowed. Patients with hepatitis virus B or C (HBV, HCV) alone may be enrolled, but HBV+ pts must have adequately controlled viral suppression prior to enrollment and HBV/HCV replication will be monitored during the study and treated if appropriate. The primary endpoint is RFS as assessed by blinded independent central radiology review using RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints include 2- and 3-year RFS, time to recurrence, overall survival, health-related quality of life measures, and safety.",,,,L629363449,10.1093/annonc/mdz183

Cabozantinib is approved for the treatment of aHCC after prior sorafenib based on improved overall survival (OS) vs placebo in the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial (Abou-Alfa NEJM 2018). Standard of care for first-line treatment of aHCC is tyrosine kinase inhibition with sorafenib or lenvatinib, and phase 3 trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in first- and second- line aHCC are ongoing. Cabozantinib may promote an immune-permissive tumor environment, which could enhance response to ICIs. Cabozantinib is being evaluated in combination with the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab in multiple tumor types including HCC in a phase 1 study; and dose, preliminary clinical activity, and safety have been established in aRCC (Agarwal Ann Oncol 2018). Atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody, has shown preliminary clinical activity in first-line aHCC (Pishvaian Ann Oncol 2018). Here, we present the study design of a phase 3 trial of cabozantinib + atezolizumab vs sorafenib in patients with aHCC who have not received prior systemic therapy. Methods: This international, randomized, open-label phase 3 trial (NCT03755791) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of cabozantinib + atezolizumab vs sorafenib as firstline treatment for aHCC. Eligibility criteria include age ≥18 years, BCLC stage B or C, Child-Pugh A, ECOG PS 0 or 1, and measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. Patients are randomized 6:3:1 to an experimental arm of cabozantinib (40 mg qd) + atezolizumab (1200 mg infusion q3w), a control arm of sorafenib (400 mg bid), and an exploratory arm of cabozantinib monotherapy (60 mg qd). 640 patients are planned at∼200 sites globally. Randomization is stratified by disease etiology (HBV [with or without HCV], HCV [without HBV], or other), region (Asia, other), and the presence of extrahepatic disease and/or macrovascular invasion (yes, no). OS and progression-free survival are co-primary endpoints and objective response rate is a secondary endpoint.

Method: Eligible pts had radiographic or pathologic diagnoses of HCC, progression on/intolerance to sorafenib, Child-Pugh A disease and ECOG PS 0-1. Pts were randomized 2:1 to Pembro 200 mg+ BSC or placebo (Pbo) + BSC IV every 3 wk, stratified by geographic region, MVI and AFP levels for ≥35 cycles or until confirmed PD/unacceptable toxicity. Response was assessed every 6 wk (RECIST v1.1, central imaging review). Co-primary endpoints were OS and PFS. Secondary endpoints were ORR, DOR and safety. Data cutoff: OS, final analysis (Jan 2 2019); PFS, first interim (Mar 26 2018) and final analyses. Results: 413 patients were randomized (278 to Pembro,135 to Pbo). After a median follow up of 13.8 mo, 10.1% of pts remained on Pembro, 3.0% on Pbo. Pembro improved OS (HR 0.781, 95% CI 0.611-0.998; one sided p=0.0238) and PFS (HR 0.775, 95% CI 0.609-0.987; one sided p=0.0186 [first interim] and 0.718, 95% CI 0.570-0.904; one sided p=0.0022 [final analysis]) vs Pbo; differences in OS at final and PFS at first interim analyses did not meet significance per the prespecified statistical plan. ORR (95% CI) was 18.3% (14.0-23.4%) and 4.4% (1.6-9.4%) for Pembro vs Pbo at final analysis (one sided p=0.00007); Pembro responses were durable (median DOR: 13.8 mo [1.5+ - 23.6+]). Off study, anticancer therapy use was 42% for Pembro and 47% for Pbo.

Conclusion: Pembro reduced the risk of death by 22% and improved PFS vs Pbo in pts with advanced HCC, but significance did not meet prespecified statistical criteria. ORR for Pembro was consistent with that of KEYNOTE-224. New anticancer therapy in the Pbo arm likely impacted OS. The safety profile was comparable to that established for Pembro monotherapy.

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2019","2019","30",,"aa70","aa71","1 Jul 2019","Introduction: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields), an antimitotic cancer treatment, utilizes low intensity (1-3 V/cm), intermediate frequency (100-300 kHz), alternating electric fields delivered non-invasively by transducer arrays placed on the skin over the tumor region. Safety of TTFields has been established in pancreatic cancer (Phase II study; PANOVA; NCT01971281). A Phase 3 study in locally-advanced pancreatic cancer (PANOVA-3) and a phase 2 study in hepatocellular cancer are ongoing. Preclinical studies suggest that TTFields' intensity correlates with treatment efficacy. Simulations can determine the thermal safety of TTFields by evaluating tissue heating due to field absorption and resultant risk of thermal damage. We used computational simulations to study the effectiveness of field distribution and associated heating in realistic phantoms during TTFields delivery to the abdomen. Methods: Delivery of TTFields to computational phantoms of amale (DUKE 3.0), a female (ELLA 3.0) and an obesemale (FATS 3.0) was simulated. For each phantom, 6-8 different transducer array layouts to the abdomen were tested. Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) levels were calculated to assess the risk of thermal damage to tissues and compared to the SAR control level of 10W/kgper International Commission onNon-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines for occupational exposure (Health Physics 74 (4) 494; 1998). The field intensities weremeasured to determine the effectiveness of treatment delivery. Results: Altering the size and position of the arrays facilitates field intensities above the therapeutic threshold of 1 V/cm. Within the abdominal internal organs, the SAR values were generally below the ICNIRP recommended level of 10 W/kg. The maximum SAR levels did not exceed 20 W/kg. Conclusion: TTFields could be delivered at intensities above the therapeutic threshold of 1 V/cm by strategizing the array size and placement. TTFields to the abdomen can be delivered to target gastrointestinal cancers without causing thermal damage to abdominal tissues. These results also indicate that TTFields delivery can be optimized in gastrointestinal cancers.",,,,L629363755,10.1093/annonc/mdz183

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2019","2019","70","6","1262","1277","1 Jun 2019","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Around half of patients with HCC will receive systemic therapies during their life span. The pivotal positive sorafenib trial and regulatory approval in 2007 was followed by a decade of negative studies with drugs leading to marginal antitumoral efficacy, toxicity, or trials with a lack of enrichment strategies. This trend has changed over the last 2 years with several compounds, such as lenvatinib (in first-line) and regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab and nivolumab (in second-line), showing clinical benefit. These successes came at a cost of increasing the complexity of decision-making, and ultimately, impacting the design of future clinical trials. Nowadays, life expectancy with single active agents has surpassed the threshold of 1 year and sequential strategies have provided encouraging outcomes. Overall survival (OS) remains the main endpoint in phase III investigations, but as in other solid tumours, there is a clear need to define surrogate endpoints that both reliably recapitulate survival benefits and can be assessed before additional efficacious drugs are administered. A thorough analysis of 21 phase III trials published in advanced HCC demonstrated a moderate correlation between progression-free survival (PFS) or time to progression (TTP) and OS (R = 0.84 and R = 0.83, respectively). Nonetheless, the significant differences in PFS identified in 7 phase III studies only correlated with differences in OS in 3 cases. In these cases, the hazard ratio (HR) for PFS was ≤0.6. Thus, this threshold is herein proposed as a potential surrogate endpoint of OS in advanced HCC. Conversely, PFS with an HR between 0.6–0.7, despite significance, was not associated with better survival, and thus these magnitudes are considered uncertain surrogates. In the current review, we discuss the reasons for positive or negative phase III trials in advanced HCC, and the strengths and limitations of surrogate endpoints (PFS, TTP and objective response rate [ORR]) to predict survival.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02576509)",,30943423,L2001775596,10.1016/j.jhep.2019.01.028

We assessed the intravenous perfusion of doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in whom previous sorafenib therapy had failed. Methods: We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial at 70 sites in 11 countries. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with one or more previous systemic therapies, including sorafenib, were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg/m(2) doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles (30 mg/m(2) group), 20 mg/m(2) doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles (20 mg/m(2) group), or standard care using a computer-generated randomisation list prepared by the funder and stratified by geographic region. Patients in the experimental groups received perfusion of the drug every 4 weeks and those in the control group received any systemic anticancer therapy (except sorafenib) as per investigator decision. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in the population of patients who received at least one dose of their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01655693. Findings: Between June 15, 2012, and Jan 27, 2017, 541 patients were screened, of whom 144 were excluded and 397 were randomly assigned to one of the groups (133 to the 30 mg/m(2) group; 130 to the 20 mg/m(2) group; and 134 to the control group). Median follow-up was 22·7 months (IQR 11·2–34·9). After pooling the doxorubicin groups for the efficacy analysis, median overall survival was 9·1 months (95% CI 8·1–10·4) in the pooled doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles group and 9·0 months (7·1–11·8) in the control group (HR 1·00 [95% CI 0·78–1·28], two-sided p=0·99). 227 (94%) of 242 patients who received doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles and 100 (75%) of 134 patients in the control group had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. The most common drug-related grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (25 [10%] of 242 treated with doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles and eight [6%] of 134 in the control group), asthenia (six [2%] and four [3%]), and thrombocytopenia (three [1%] and ten [7%]). Six (2%) patients treated with doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles and one (1%) of those in the control group were deemed by investigators to have had a drug-related death. Serious adverse events occurred in 74 (31%) patients who received doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles and 48 (36%) in the control group.

Survival benefits of resection/local ablation for early HCC are compromised by 70% 5-year recurrence rates. The phase 3 STORM trial comparing sorafenib with placebo as adjuvant treatment did not achieve its primary endpoint of improving recurrence-free survival (RFS). The biomarker companion study BIOSTORM aims to define (A) predictors of recurrence prevention with sorafenib and (B) prognostic factors with B level of evidence. Design Tumour tissue from 188 patients randomised to receive sorafenib (83) or placebo (105) in the STORM trial was collected. Analyses included gene expression profiling, targeted exome sequencing (19 known oncodrivers), immunohistochemistry (pERK, pVEGFR2, Ki67), fluorescence in situ hybridisation (VEGFA) and immunome. A gene signature capturing improved RFS in sorafenib-treated patients was generated. All 70 RFS events were recurrences, thus time to recurrence equalled RFS. Predictive and prognostic value was assessed using Cox regression models and interaction test. Results BIOSTORM recapitulates clinicopathological characteristics of STORM. None of the biomarkers tested (related to angiogenesis and proliferation) or previously proposed gene signatures, or mutations predicted sorafenib benefit or recurrence. A newly generated 146-gene signature identifying 30% of patients captured benefit to sorafenib in terms of RFS (p of interaction=0.04). These sorafenib RFS responders were significantly enriched in CD4 + T, B and cytolytic natural killer cells, and lacked activated adaptive immune components. Hepatocytic pERK (HR=2.41; p=0.012) and microvascular invasion (HR=2.09; p=0.017) were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion In BIOSTORM, only hepatocytic pERK and microvascular invasion predicted poor RFS. No mutation, gene amplification or previously proposed gene signatures predicted sorafenib benefit. A newly generated multigene signature associated with improved RFS on sorafenib warrants further validation.

Unlike these cost-effective analyses, where efficacy parameters were obtained from registration trials for drug approval, this analysis is a cost-effectiveness analysis of SOF+RBV for genotype (GT) 2 non-cirrhosis (NC) and compensated cirrhosis (CC) patients using efficacy parameters obtained from a multicentre cohort study (Kyushu University Liver Disease Study; KULDS) in Kyushu area in Japan in order to reflect real-world clinical practice in Japan. Method A Markov model followed 10 000 patients (62 years old) over their lifetime. Four populations were followed: Treatment-naïve (TN)-NC, treatment-experienced (TE)-NC, TN-CC and TE-CC. Comparators were Peg-IFNα2b+RBV for TN-NC and CC patients and telaprevir (TVR)+Peg-IFNα2b+RBV for TE-NC patients. The sustained virological response (SVR) rates of SOF+RBV were taken from KULDS and those of comparators were obtained from systematic literature reviews. There were nine states (NC, CC, decompensated cirrhosis [DC], hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], SVR [NC], SVR [CC], liver transplantation [LT], post-LT and death) in this model, and an increase in the progression rate to HCC due to ageing was also considered. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of a public healthcare payer, and a discount rate of 2% was set for both cost and effectiveness. Results Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of SOF+RBV versus Peg-IFNα2b+RBV were ¥323 928 /quality-Adjusted life year (QALY) for TN-NC patients, ¥92 256/QALY for TN-CC patients and ¥1 519 202/QALY for TE-CC patients. The ICER of SOF+RBV versus TVR+Peg-IFNα2b+RBV was ¥849 138/QALY for TE-NC patients. The robustness of the results was determined by sensitivity analysis. Conclusions The results of this analysis strongly demonstrate the robustness of our previous findings that SOF+RBV regimens are cost-effective in the real world and clinical trial settings for Japanese GT2 NC and CC patients.",,,31221866,L628211343,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023405

Tumor tissues from 7 responders and 10 patients who did not respond (progressors) were analyzed by next-generation sequencing (FoundationOne). Forty-six tumor tissues were analyzed for expression patterns of 770 genes involved in oncogenic and inflammatory pathways (PanCancer Immune Profiling). Associations between plasma levels of proteins and miRNAs and response to treatment (overall survival and time to progression) were evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Decreased baseline plasma concentrations of 5 of 266 evaluable proteins (angiopoietin 1, cystatin B, the latency-associated peptide of transforming growth factor beta 1, oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 3; adjusted P ≤.05) were significantly associated with increased overall survival time after regorafenib treatment. Levels of these 5 proteins, which have roles in inflammation and/or HCC pathogenesis, were not associated with survival independently of treatment. Only 20 of 499 patients had high levels and a reduced survival time. Plasma levels of α-fetoprotein and c-MET were associated with poor outcome (overall survival) independently of regorafenib treatment only. We identified 9 plasma miRNAs (MIR30A, MIR122, MIR125B, MIR200A, MIR374B, MIR15B, MIR107, MIR320, and MIR645) whose levels significantly associated with overall survival time with regorafenib (adjusted P ≤.05). Functional analyses of these miRNAs indicated that their expression level associated with increased overall survival of patients with tumors of the Hoshida S3 subtype. Next-generation sequencing analyses of tumor tissues revealed 49 variants in 27 oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Mutations in CTNNB1 were detected in 3 of 10 progressors and VEGFA amplification in 1 of 7 responders. Conclusion: We identified expression patterns of plasma proteins and miRNAs that associated with increased overall survival times of patients with HCC following treatment with regorafenib in the RESORCE trial. Levels of these circulating biomarkers and genetic features of tumors might be used to identify patients with HCC most likely to respond to regorafenib. ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01774344.

The objective of this analysis was to derive utility values for cost-effectiveness models. Methods: Patients completed EQ-5D-5L at date of first drug dose, every 4 weeks through week 25, then every 8 weeks until 8 weeks post disease progression. UK utility values were obtained using the “crosswalk” developed by Van Hout, et al(2). As part of the sensitivity analysis, utility values were also derived using the algorithm based on EQ-5D-5L (Office of Health Economics, 2014). Ordinary least squares, Tobit regression with repeated measurements and mixed model for repeated measurements models were tested including treatment discontinuation, progression status and presence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) grade≥3 as potential predictors. The preferred model was selected based on three criteria: use of repeated measurements, Akaike information criterion (AIC) and residuals. Results: In pre-progression status, 2186 questionnaires were analyzed, with slightly higher mean (SD) utility values in patients still on treatment vs patients who had discontinued treatment, 0.73 (0.21) vs. 0.70 (0.24) (p=0.01). After progression status, 696 questionnaires were analyzed; patients that were still on treatment obtained higher utility values, 0.73 (0.21) vs. 0.69 (0.25) (p=0.02). The multivariable mixed model for repeated measures was selected, including progression status and presence of TEAE grade≥3 as predictors. Treatment discontinuation was discarded due to the high correlation with disease progression. The model estimated an intercept of 0.730, with disutility values associated with presence of TEAE grade≥3 of 0.072 (p<0.01) and disutility values associated with disease progression of 0.030 (p<0.01). Conclusions: In the CELESTIAL study, lower utility values were associated with disease progression and presence of TEAE grade≥3.",,,,L2002154536,10.1016/j.jval.2019.04.413

We report the case of a woman in whom lenvatinib showed long-term antitumor activity, and in whom computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a series of suggestive radiological changes on the intratumor vascularity. A 68-year-old woman with hepatitis C virus-related liver disease presented with multiple HCCs. Following previous therapy, including six sessions of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, we introduced lenvatinib monotherapy. Lenvatinib could rapidly cause hypovascularity in the main hypervascular target lesion, and portal vein tumor thrombosis also became undetectable 11 months after the initiation of lenvatinib. These radiological changes suggested that lenvatinib could exert not only anti-angiogenic activity but also direct antitumoral effect. Of note, CT scans during lenvatinib treatment revealed the target lesion as a low-density area in the early arterial phase, whereas scans during drug interruption due to proteinuria showed that the lesion was enhanced in the arterial phase. Finally, near-complete response could be achieved as the best response. We successfully managed various adverse events including proteinuria and hypertension, and the patient was able to continue this lenvatinib therapy for more than 4 years with well-controlled general condition. We report the first case of a patient with HCC in whom lenvatinib monotherapy demonstrated long-term antitumor activity.

Date of Publication: 1 May 2019","2019","13","3","253","258","1 May 2019","Abstract: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an increasingly common cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related death (LRD). Consequently, there is a critical need for effective drug therapy that improves clinically relevant end-points. Hepatic steatosis assessed by magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction is increasingly used in the early phase trials examining drugs with anti-steatotic effects. However, the prognostic significance of a reduction in steatosis is unknown, and thus, phase 3 trials require a histological end-point of NASH resolution without fibrosis progression. Nonetheless, it is not clear whether this end-point which requires a liver biopsy reflects a better prognosis. Thus, conditional drug approval currently requires long-term follow-up to demonstrate reduction in ‘harder’ end-points of cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and LRD. Currently, there is an essential need to develop accurate non-invasive markers that are dynamic to drug-induced changes in underlying disease severity and prognosis to utilize as surrogate end-points for clinical trials in NASH.

Date of Publication: 1 May 2019","2019","69","5","1983","1994","1 May 2019","We aimed to determine the surveillance performance of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), lectin-reactive AFP (AFP-L3), des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), and their combinations for the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using prospectively collected longitudinal samples in patients at risk. Among 689 patients with cirrhosis and/or chronic hepatitis B who participated in four prospective studies, 42 HCC cases were diagnosed, selected, and matched with 168 controls for age, sex, etiology, cirrhosis, and duration of follow-up in a 1:4 ratio. Levels of AFP, AFP-L3, and DCP at the time of HCC diagnosis, month −6, and month −12 were compared between cases and controls. Of 42 HCC cases, 39 (93%) had cirrhosis, 36 (85.7%) had normal alanine aminotransferase levels, and 31 (73.8%) had very early-stage HCC (single <2 cm). AFP and AFP-L3 began to increase from 6 months before diagnosis of HCC in cases (P < 0.05), while they remained unchanged in controls. At HCC diagnosis, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUROCs) for AFP, AFP-L3, and DCP were 0.77, 0.73, and 0.71, respectively. Combining AFP and AFP-L3 showed a higher AUROC (0.83), while adding DCP did not further improve the AUROC (0.86). With the optimal cutoff values (AFP, 5 ng/mL; AFP-L3, 4%), the sensitivity and specificity of AFP and AFP-L3 combination were 79% and 87%, respectively. The sensitivity of ultrasonography was 48.6%, which was increased to 88.6% and 94.3% by adding AFP and AFP + AFP-L3, respectively. Conclusion: Among three biomarkers, AFP showed the best performance in discriminating HCC cases from controls; the AFP and AFP-L3 combination, adopting cutoff values (5 ng/mL and 4%, respectively), significantly improved the sensitivity for detecting HCC at a very early stage.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT 01446666)",,30153338,L626474048,10.1002/hep.30233

Date of Publication: 1 May 2019","2019","37",,,,"1 May 2019","Background: AK105 is a humanized IgG1 mAb that blocks PD-1 binding to PD-L1 allowing T-cells to recognize and kill tumor cells. Key attributes of AK105 include antibody engineering to eliminate Fc mediated effector function, and a slower off-rate on antigen binding resulting in improved receptor occupancy. These features were designed to offer more robust biological effect and enhance anti-tumor activity of AK105. Methods: A multicenter, Phase I/II, single-arm study in relapsed/refractory cHL (NCT03722147) began in July, 2018, evaluating the safety and efficacy of AK105 administered IV q2w till disease progression (response assessed by Lugano 2014 criteria). Eligible pts had relapsed/refractory cHL after most recent therapy with progression after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or at least 2 lines of prior chemotherapy. Enrollment for Phase I part of the study was completed, and Phase II at the RP2D of AK105 200 mg q2w is ongoing. Results:As of 1 Feb, 2019, in the Phase I part, 6 Chinese patients (pts) median age 26.5 years [19-38], female 33%, ECOG 0/1 ([67%/33%]), had received a median of 7 (3-12) doses of AK105 200mg q2w. No DLT and SAE were reported. No immune-related grade 2 (G2) or higher adverse reactions were reported. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 83% (5/6) of pts (G3 in 17% [1/6], no G4, none leading to treatment interruption or discontinuation). Most frequent TRAEs (≥2 pts) were hypothyroidism (33%, 2/6) and ALT increased (33%, 2/6). PK profile for Chinse pts is consistent with that in Caucasian pts. Of 5 evaluable heavily pretreated pts, ORR was 100% (5/5, 3 CR and 2 PR). All 3 pts achieved CR at the first tumor assessment (i.e., week 8) and remained in CR at the last assessment (i.e., week 24) prior to data cutoff. The other 2 pts achieved PR at week 8 and the responses are still ongoing. Conclusions: The reported safety profile and encouraging early antitumor activity of AK105 supports continued clinical development, which include: pivotal studies in relapsed/refractory cHL and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, phase 2/3 combination studies with chemotherapy in NSCLC and combination study with anlotinib, a multi-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor in hepatocellular carcinoma.",,,,L629301657,10.1200/JCO.2019.37.15_suppl.e19017

We conducted a nationwide multicenter study and especially focused on the efficacy and safety in the patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria of the phase 3 trial (REFLECT trial). Methods: A total of 202 patients received LEN from March 2018 at 21 sites in Japan was registered. Tumour assessments in accordance with modified RECIST were done using dynamic CT or MRI within 4-8 weeks and every 6-8 weeks thereafter. Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the CTCAE ver4.0. Results: In this study, 128 of 202 (63%) patients did not meet the inclusion criteria of the REFLECT trial. For the reasons, 69 patients received TKI therapy before LEN, 37 patients were Child-Pugh B, 6 patients showed main portal vein invasion,13 patients had HCC which occupied ≥ 50% of liver, and 22 patients were with lower platelet ( < 75 × 10(9) per L) . Median observation time was 4.1 months in all patients, 22 patients died, and median overall survival (OS) was not reached. As the 2nd-line therapy (after sorafenib), 45 patients received LEN and 24 patients did as the 3rd-line (after regorafenib). The OS between TKI naïve and experienced patients was not significantly different, even though baseline albumin level and ALBI score were significantly lower in TKI experienced patients than TKI naïve (p = 0.001 and 0.005). Objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) of TKI naïve patients were 37% and 84%, while those of TKI experienced were 27% and 76%. Child-Pugh B patients (n = 36) had significantly shorter OS than Child-Pugh A (p = 0.01) and median OS in Child-Pugh B patients was 6.1 months.

KEYNOTE240 (NCT02702401) was a randomized, placebo (Pbo) controlled, phase 3 study of Pembro vs BSC in pts with previously treated advanced HCC. Methods:Eligible pts had a radiographic or pathologic diagnosis of HCC, radiographic progression on/intolerance to sorafenib, ChildPugh A disease and ECOG PS 01. Pts were randomized 2:1 to receive Pembro 200 mg + BSC or Pbo + BSC IV every 3 wk, stratified by geographic region, macrovascular invasion and a fetoprotein levels for ≤35 cycles or until confirmed PD/unacceptable toxicity. Response was assessed every 6 wk per RECIST v1.1 by central imaging review. Coprimary endpoints were OS and PFS. Secondary endpoints included ORR, DOR and safety. Data cut-off was Jan 2 2019 for OS; Mar 26 2018 for PFS and ORR. Results: 413 patients were randomized; 278 to Pembro and 135 to Pbo. After a median follow up of 13.8 mo, 10.1% of pts remained on Pembro and 3.0% on Pbo. Pembro improved OS (HR: 0.78; one sided p = 0.0238) and PFS (HR: 0.78; one sided p = 0.0209) vs Pbo; these differences did not meet significance per the prespecified statistical plan. ORR was 16.9% (95% CI 12.721.8%) for Pembro vs 2.2% (95% CI 0.56.4%) for Pbo (nominal one sided p = 0.00001); responses on Pembro were durable (median DOR: 13.8 mo [1.523.6+]).

OS and PFS with C were evaluated for pts with any grade PPE or grade ≥3 HTN within the first 8 weeks of study treatment. Results: Overall, 374 (80%) pts in the C arm and 179 (76%) pts in the P arm completed ≥8 weeks of treatment. In the first 8 weeks, 188 (40%) of Ctreated pts developed any grade PPE vs 11 (5%) of Ptreated pts, and 61 (13%) of Ctreated pts developed grade ≥3 HTN vs 3 (1%) of Ptreated pts. Median OS with C was 14.4 mo for pts with any grade PPE vs 8.4 mo for pts without PPE (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.74), and median PFS with C was 6.5 mo vs 3.7 mo, respectively (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.510.78). Median OS with C was 16.1 mo for pts with grade ≥3 HTN vs 9.5 mo for pts without grade ≥3 HTN (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.390.80), and median PFS with C was 7.4 mo vs 4.4 mo, respectively (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.430.82). Some imbalances in baseline characteristics were present. Pts with PPE had better ECOG PS (60% vs 47% ECOG 0), better liver function (48% vs 34% ALBI grade 1), and less macrovascular invasion (24% vs 30%) than those without. Likewise, pts with grade ≥3 HTN had better ECOG PS (61% vs 51% ECOG 0), better liver function (56% vs 37% ALBI grade 1), and less macrovascular invasion (20% vs 29%) than those without. Conclusions: The development of PPE or grade ≥3 HTN with C was associated with prolonged OS and PFS in pts with previously treated aHCC although some imbalances in baseline characteristics between comparator groups were present.",,,,L629337842,10.1200/jco.2019.37.15_suppl.4088

Namodenoson, an A3AR agonist, showed promising preliminary results in this population in an open label phase 1/2 clinical study (NCT00790218), with median overall survival (OS) of 8.1 months. We present the results of a double blind, randomized phase 2, placebo-controlled study (NCT02128958), assessing the efficacy and safety of namodenoson as a second-line therapy of patients with advanced HCC and CPB class. Methods: Patients were randomized 2:1 to BID namodenoson (25 mg; n = 50) or placebo (n = 28) in 15 centers globally. Primary endpoint was OS and secondary endpoints were safety, progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (OR) and disease control rate (DCR). Assessment of OS and PFS was done by log rank test at a one final analysis when 75 deaths had occurred. Response was assessed by RECIST (local investigator) and mRECIST (central review). Results: The study did not meet the primary end point, with median OS 4.1 months (mo) for namodenoson vs. 4.3 mo for placebo (HR: 0.82). Pre-planned subgroup analysis of Child-Pugh 7 patients (n=56; namodenoson=34, placebo=21) showed median survival 6.8mo vs 4.3 mo [HR: 0.77 (95% CI 0.49-1.40)]. Similarly, for this subgroup of patients PFS was 3.5 mo vs 1.9 (HR=0.87). In terms of objective response, 3/34 patients assessed achieved OR (9%) with namodenoson vs 0% for placebo. Namodenoson was generally well-tolerated, with no treated patients being withdrawn for toxicity and no cases of treatment-related deaths. The most common adverse event (>10%) were anemia, abdominal pain, ascites, nausea, asthenia, fatigue, peripheral edema, and increased AST. Treatment-related grade 3 toxicities accounted for anemia, fatigue and hyponatremia. Conclusions: Namodenoson has demonstrated favorable clinical safety profile in patients with advanced HCC and severe liver dysfunction. Although the primary end-point was not met, the subgroup analysis showed a positive signal of efficacy for OS in patients with Child-Pugh 7. Both safety and efficacy results warrant testing this drug in a phase III trial.",,,,L629438504,10.1200/JCO.2019.37.15_suppl.2503

Date of Publication: 1 May 2019","2019","37",,,,"1 May 2019","Background: AK105 is a humanized IgG1 mAb that blocks PD-1 binding to PD-L1 allowing T-cells to recognize and kill tumor cells. Key attributes of AK105 include antibody engineering to eliminate Fc mediated effector function, and a slower off-rate on antigen binding resulting in improved receptor occupancy (RO). These features offer more robust biological effect and enhance antitumor activity of AK105. Methods: A multicenter, Phase I, openlabel dose escalation and expansion study in solid tumors (NCT03352531) began in Dec 2017, evaluating the safety and efficacy of AK105 administered IV q2w till confirmed progression (RECIST v1.1). For dose escalation, pts were enrolled at dose cohorts of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg. Expansion of AK105 at the RP2D of 200 mg q2w is ongoing in pts with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma; esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer. Results: As of 1 Feb, 2019, 34 pts (median age 66.5 years [30-79], female 44%, ECOG 0/1 ([68%/32%]) in cohorts of 1 mg/kg (n = 3), 3 mg/kg (n = 6), 10 mg/kg (n = 7), and 200 mg q2w (n = 18), received a median of 5 (1-29) doses of AK105. No DLTs were reported. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 41% of pts (G3 in 12% [4/34], no G4, treatment interruption in 9% [3/34]). Most frequent TRAEs ( > 5%) were hyperthyroidism (9%), hypothyroidism (6%), fatigue (6%), and rash (6%). PD-1 RO analysis showed that pts maintained full occupancy ( > 80%) for all dose levels. Of 25 evaluable heavily pretreated pts, ORR was 24% (6/25; 29% [4/14] in dose escalation and 18% [2/11] in expansion phase) and disease control rate (DCR) was 56% (14/25). Five responses are confirmed and ongoing (HCC, pancreatic carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, GBM, gastric adenocarcinoma), one is pending confirmatory scan (GEJ). Conclusions: The RP2D obtained from the dose escalation phase, reported safety profile and encouraging antitumor activity of AK105 supports continued clinical development, which include: pivotal studies in classic Hodgkin lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, phase 2/3 combination studies with chemotherapy in NSCLC and combination study with anlotinib, a multi-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor in HCC.

Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical outcomes of sorafenib combined with concurrent conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) vs. sorafenib alone in patients with advanced HCC. Methods: In this investigator-initiated, multicenter, phase III trial, patients were randomized to receive sorafenib alone (Arm S, n = 169) or in combination with cTACE on demand (Arm C, n = 170). Sorafenib was started within 3 days and cTACE within 7–21 days of randomization. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results: For Arms C and S, the median OS was 12.8 vs. 10.8 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.91; 90% CI 0.69–1.21; p = 0.290); median time to progression, 5.3 vs. 3.5 months (HR 0.67; 90% CI 0.53–0.85; p = 0.003); median progression-free survival, 5.2 vs. 3.6 months (HR 0.73; 90% CI 0.59–0.91; p = 0.01); and tumor response rate, 60.6% vs. 47.3% (p = 0.005). For Arms C and S, serious (grade ≥3) adverse events occurred in 33.3% vs. 19.8% (p = 0.006) of patients and included increased alanine aminotransferase levels (20.3% vs. 3.6%), hyperbilirubinemia (11.8% vs. 3.0%), ascites (11.8% vs. 4.2%), thrombocytopenia (7.2% vs. 1.2%), anorexia (7.2% vs. 1.2%), and hand-foot skin reaction (10.5% vs. 11.4%). A post hoc subgroup analysis compared OS in Arm C patients (46.4%) receiving ≥2 cTACE sessions to Arm S patients (18.6 vs. 10.8 months; HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.40–0.82; p = 0.006). Conclusion: Compared with sorafenib alone, sorafenib combined with cTACE did not improve OS in patients with advanced HCC. However, sorafenib combined with cTACE significantly improved time to progression, progression-free survival, and tumor response rate. Sorafenib alone remains the first-line standard of care for patients with advanced HCC. Lay summary: For patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma requiring sorafenib therapy, co-administration with conventional transarterial chemoembolization did not improve overall survival compared to sorafenib alone. Therefore, sorafenib alone remains the first-line standard of care for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

Date of Publication: 1 Apr 2019","2019","70","1","e143",,"1 Apr 2019","Background and aims: Acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may develop into a chronic disease, leading to a carrier state, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer. Although licensed HBV vaccines are safe and effective in controlling HBV in healthy people younger than 40 years of age, vaccine efficacy decreases with age, in diabetics or smokers, in people with compromised immunity, or because of non-compliance with the required regimen. In both the US and Europe, there have been significant decreases in the incidence rates of acute HVB, however, the prevalence of chronic HBV and HBV carriers has actually remained constant or even increased. Europe, more so than the US, faces an increased risk of HBV due to the higher numbers of migrants and refugees. Thus, a more potent vaccine that is safe and protects faster or with fewer doses may address both public health and compliance needs. We tested the ability of SciBVac, a third generation HBV vaccine containing the Pre-S1, Pre-S2 and S components of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) to elicit robust seroprotection after two or three immunizations. Method: We analyzed the seroprotection rates (SPR or Anti-HBs of >10 IU/ml) after the second and third doses of Sci-B-Vac in three clinical studies, a phase 4 study conducted in Israel, a single arm open study (SciBVac n = 83) and two phase 3 studies; a single-blind comparative, controlled, randomized study conducted in Vietnam (SciBVac n = 120 and Engerix n = 117) and a comparative randomized study conducted in Russia (SciBVac n = 47 and Engerix n = 47). The three studies were conducted according to good clinical practice in healthy volunteers 18-45 years of age. Blood for Hepatitis B antibody testing was collected before and after each immunization. Standard diary cards were collected to determine vaccine reactogenicity and safety. Volunteers were followed for a total of 12 months. Results: The SPR after two immunizations with SciBVac (day 180) was 98.8% (82/83) in the single arm Israeli study. The SPR after two immunizations with SciBVac or Engerix (day 180) was 98.3% (118/120) vs 81.2% (95/117, p = <0.001) in the Vietnamese study and 100% (47/47) vs 89% (42/47, p = 0.06), respectively in the Russian study. SPR post third immunization with SciBVac was 100% and 98% for Engerix in both phase 3 studies. Both vaccines had a similar reactogenicity and safety profile with no safety signals detected during volunteer follow-up. Conclusion: Three separate SciBVac clinical studies demonstrate that the vaccine is well tolerated and that most individuals under the age of 45 achieve seroprotection with two doses of SciBVac.",,,,L2001820510,10.1016/S0618-8278(19)30252-X
"Hepatocellular carcinoma does not impact the efficacy of avatrombopag in increasing platelet counts and reducing platelet transfusions or rescue procedures for bleeding in chronic liver disease patients with thrombocytopenia","Alkhouri N., Aggarwal K., Vredenburg M., Tian W., Allen L.F.","Journal of Hepatology (2019) 70:1 Supplement (e690-e691). Date of Publication: 1 Apr 2019","2019","70","1","e690","e691","1 Apr 2019","Background and aims: Patients with CLD and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)may require invasive procedures such as ablation and embolization. Thrombocytopenia (TCP)is common in patients with CLD and may increase the risk of bleeding with invasive procedures. Avatrombopag (AVA)is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist FDA-approved as an alternative to platelet transfusions (PT)for patients with TCP and CLD undergoing a procedure. This analysis assessed whether HCC status affected the efficacy of AVA. Method: Two randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled Phase 3 trials (ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2)enrolled 435 adults with CLD and platelet counts (PC)< 50 × 10(9)/L undergoing a procedure. Patients were divided by Baseline PC into Cohort 1- PC < 40 × 10(9)/L and Cohort 2- PC 40 to < 50 × 10(9)/L, and then randomized 2:1 to once-daily oral AVA (60 mg or 40 mg, respectively)or PBO for 5 days; the procedure was done 5 to 8 days after the last dose. The primary efficacy end point in both studies was the proportion of patients not requiring a PT or rescue procedure, and the first secondary end point was the proportion of patients achieving a PC ≥ 50 × 10(9)/L on Procedure Day. Subgroup analyses of efficacy were also conducted based on HCC status. [Table Presented]Results: Overall, AVA was superior to PBO in both cohorts in the proportion of patients not requiring a PT or rescue procedure for bleeding (Cohort 1: p < 0.0001; Cohort 2: p < 0.0001). Efficacy by HCC status was generally similar between the different treatment groups for the primary end point. Cohort 1: No HCC: AVA 68.4%, PBO 34.9%; HCC: AVA 64.3%, PBO 12.0%; Cohort 2: No HCC: AVA 91.7%, PBO 36.7%; HCC: AVA 81.3%, PBO 33.3%. Similarly, efficacy results for the secondary end point were also generally comparable regardless of HCC status. Cohort 1: No HCC: AVA 68.4%, PBO 6.1%; HCC: AVA 69.1%, PBO 4.0%; Cohort 2: No HCC: AVA 91.7%, PBO 28.6%; HCC: AVA 90.6%, PBO 33.3%. Fewer HCC patients in the Cohort 2 PBO arm reached the primary end point compared to non-HCC patients though their baseline PC was similar. Conclusion: AVA was superior to PBO in increasing PC and reducing both the proportion of patients with CLD who required a PT or rescue procedure for bleeding, and the proportion of patients who achieved a PC ≥ 50 × 10(9)/L by Procedure Day. Efficacy was similar for both end points regardless of HCC status, supporting the consist efficacy of AVA.",,,,L2001820973,10.1016/S0618-8278(19)31375-1

The RESORCE trial reported that median overall survival (OS)from the date of starting sorafenib for patients with the regorafenib arm to be over 26 months. However, the baseline clinical data at the time of starting sorafenib was not collected in the RESORCE trial. Therefore, the clinical benefit of sorafenib-regorafenib sequential therapy should be confirmed using data collected in field practice. This study aims to analyze the impact of sorafenib-regorafenib sequential therapy from the starting date of sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC. Method: We retrospectively identified patients with advanced HCC who received sorafenib as the first line systemic therapy from June 2009 through December 2017. We excluded Child-Pugh B patients from this analysis. Results: A total of 323 patients with Child-Pugh A liver function received sorafenib. Median age was 72 years, and the most frequent etiology was hepatitis C virus (n = 165, 50.3%), followed by hepatitis B virus (n = 45, 13.7%), and alcohol abuse (n = 43, 13.1%). A total of 94 (28.7%)patients had macrovascular invasion (MVI), and 142 (43.3%)had extrahepatic metastasis (EHM). The Majority of patients (89%)started a full dose of sorafenib (800 mg). The median OS for all patients was 13.7 months (95%CI, 11.8–14.2). During the observation period, 29 patients were switched to regorafenib from sorafenib. The median OS in patients with sorafenib-regorafenib sequential therapy was 25.3 months (95%CI, 17.8–32.8)and which was higher than in patients who were treated with sorafenib therapy alone, i.e. they were unable to convert to regorafenib (median OS, 12.3 months; 95%CI, 10.4–14.2; P = 0.001). Not receiving regorafenib was an independent poor prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis with a cox hazard model, as well as for ECOG performance status, MVI, EHM, Child-Pugh score, and α-fetoprotein value. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated the benefit of sorafenib-regorafenib sequential therapy in patients with advanced HCC using clinical data at the time of starting sorafenib.

Based on mRECIST, CR was shown in 5 (7.6%), PR in 22 (33.3%), SD in 28 (42.4%), and PD in 11 (16.7%). Overall response rate (ORR) ORR and disease control rate (DCR) DCR of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) naïve patients (n = 37) were 40.4% and 83.7%, while those of TKI experienced (n = 29) were 41.3% and 82.7%. Fifty-two patients started at 12 mg/day and dose reduction was necessary in 87.0% of the patients. The common any-grade AEs were hypertension (52.2%), diarrhoea (30.9%), decreased appetite (57.4.%), fatigue (51.6%) and proteinuria (41.0%). Hand-food skin reaction (HFSR) was observed in 28.9% of patients. The incidence of decreased appetite and fatigue were higher in the patients with lower BW (< 60 kg), even though the initial dose was based on actual BW. Conclusion: The efficacy of LEN therapy in real world practice in Japan was equivalent to the phase 3 clinical trial. The response rate in TKI experienced patients was similar to TKI naïve patients. The incidence of HFSR during LEN in real world practice was lower than that of the sorafenib group in the phase 3 trial of LEN. AE profile was different from sorafenib and decreased appetite must be carefully monitored and managed.",,,,L2001821907,10.1016/S0618-8278(19)31241-1

NASH is one of the major causes of liver cancer, however, the mechanism how NASH develops hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. In addition, genetic analyses have not proposed any treatment or prevention so far, because there are no targetable driver mutations found in HCC. In the background liver which is chronically injured, typically cirrhotic, gene alterations accumulate for 20–30 years, and hepatocytes demand anti-stress and regenerative responses to survive under stressed-condition. One of the key molecules is p62, a multifunctional adaptor protein. Previously, we reported that p62 accumulates in a variety of chronic liver diseases and activate Nrf2 and mTORC1 to adapt pre-cancerous cells to stress (Cancer Cell 2016, PMID: 27211490). These responses necessary for survival in chronic liver injury may drive hepatocarcinogenesis, so that we are focusing on the NASH-background liver. Method: Using a genetic mouse model in which high fat diet induces HCC highly relevant to human NASH-HCC (Cancer Cell 2014, PMID: 25132496), we searched genes altered in the background liver by RNA sequence analysis, then examined the protein expression of the genes. Finally, we tested whether a natural product could reduce the incidence of HCC in this animal model. Results: From results of RNA sequence and immunoblotting analyses, we found that EGFR signaling was hyperactivated in the mouse NASH liver. For liver cancer, the use of EGFR inhibitors has not been successful so far. For example, a phase III trial of sorafenib plus a major EGFR inhibitor erlotinib for the treatment of advanced-HCC did not show clear benefits compared with the sorafenib plus placebo arm (J Clin Oncol 2015, PMID: 25547503). However, the preventative effect of EGFR inhibition has not been explored yet. In this mouse study, we found that inhibition of EGFR signaling by a natural compound drastically attenuated NASH-HCC incidence. Mechanistically, this treatment induced EGFR degradation, not its dephosphorylation, leading to robust tumor suppression. Conclusion: We show that EGFR inhibition significantly suppressed HCC induction in the mouse NASH-HCC model. EGFR signaling may be highly active in pre-cancerous cells which form dysplastic nodules and this signaling may facilitate these cells develop into liver cancer. Our results support the concept that EGFR signaling is a driver of liver carcinogenesis and is a suitable target for NASH-HCC prevention.

The RESORCE trial reported that median overall survival (OS) from the date of starting sorafenib for patients with the regorafenib arm to be over 26 months. However, the baseline clinical data at the time of starting sorafenib was not collected in the RESORCE trial. Therefore, the clinical benefit of sorafenib-regorafenib sequential therapy should be confirmed using data collected in field practice. This study aims to analyze the impact of sorafenib-regorafenib sequential therapy from the starting date of sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC. Method: We retrospectively identified patients with advanced HCC who received sorafenib as the first line systemic therapy from June 2009 through December 2017. We excluded Child-Pugh B patients from this analysis. Results: A total of 323 patients with Child-Pugh A liver function received sorafenib. Median age was 72 years, and the most frequent etiology was hepatitis C virus (n = 165, 50.3%), followed by hepatitis B virus (n = 45, 13.7%), and alcohol abuse (n = 43, 13.1%). A total of 94 (28.7%) patients had macrovascular invasion (MVI), and 142 (43.3%) had extrahepatic metastasis (EHM). The Majority of patients (89%) started a full dose of sorafenib (800 mg). The median OS for all patients was 13.7 months (95%CI, 11.8–14.2). During the observation period, 29 patients were switched to regorafenib from sorafenib. The median OS in patients with sorafenib-regorafenib sequential therapy was 25.3 months (95%CI, 17.8–32.8) and which was higher than in patients who were treated with sorafenib therapy alone, i.e. they were unable to convert to regorafenib (median OS, 12.3 months; 95%CI, 10.4–14.2; P = 0.001). Not receiving regorafenib was an independent poor prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis with a cox hazard model, as well as for ECOG performance status, MVI, EHM, Child-Pugh score, and α-fetoprotein value. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated the benefit of sorafenib-regorafenib sequential therapy in patients with advanced HCC using clinical data at the time of starting sorafenib. We recommend that it is necessary to increase the rate of conversion from sorafenib to regorafenib in patients with advanced HCC, although limited population of patients have switched sorafenib to regorafenib in the filed practice.

Date of Publication: 1 Apr 2019","2019","70","1","e143",,"1 Apr 2019","Background and aims: Acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may develop into a chronic disease, leading to a carrier state, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer. Although licensed HBV vaccines are safe and effective in controlling HBV in healthy people younger than 40 years of age, vaccine efficacy decreases with age, in diabetics or smokers, in people with compromised immunity, or because of non-compliance with the required regimen. In both the US and Europe, there have been significant decreases in the incidence rates of acute HVB, however, the prevalence of chronic HBV and HBV carriers has actually remained constant or even increased. Europe, more so than the US, faces an increased risk of HBV due to the higher numbers of migrants and refugees. Thus, a more potent vaccine that is safe and protects faster or with fewer doses may address both public health and compliance needs. We tested the ability of SciBVac, a third generation HBV vaccine containing the Pre-S1, Pre-S2 and S components of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) to elicit robust seroprotection after two or three immunizations. Method: We analyzed the seroprotection rates (SPR or Anti-HBs of >10 IU/ml) after the second and third doses of Sci-B-Vac in three clinical studies, a phase 4 study conducted in Israel, a single arm open study (SciBVac n = 83) and two phase 3 studies; a single-blind comparative, controlled, randomized study conducted in Vietnam (SciBVac n = 120 and Engerix n = 117) and a comparative randomized study conducted in Russia (SciBVac n = 47 and Engerix n = 47). The three studies were conducted according to good clinical practice in healthy volunteers 18-45 years of age. Blood for Hepatitis B antibody testing was collected before and after each immunization. Standard diary cards were collected to determine vaccine reactogenicity and safety. Volunteers were followed for a total of 12 months. Results: The SPR after two immunizations with SciBVac (day 180) was 98.8% (82/83) in the single arm Israeli study. The SPR after two immunizations with SciBVac or Engerix (day 180) was 98.3% (118/120) vs 81.2% (95/117, p = <0.001) in the Vietnamese study and 100% (47/47) vs 89% (42/47, p = 0.06), respectively in the Russian study. SPR post third immunization with SciBVac was 100% and 98% for Engerix in both phase 3 studies.

Thrombocytopenia (TCP) is common in patients with CLD and may increase the risk of bleeding with invasive procedures. Avatrombopag (AVA) is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist FDA-approved as an alternative to platelet transfusions (PT) for patients with TCP and CLD undergoing a procedure. This analysis assessed whether HCC status affected the efficacy of AVA. Method: Two randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled Phase 3 trials (ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2) enrolled 435 adults with CLD and platelet counts (PC) < 50 × 10(9)/L undergoing a procedure. Patients were divided by Baseline PC into Cohort 1- PC < 40 × 10(9)/L and Cohort 2- PC 40 to < 50 × 10(9)/L, and then randomized 2:1 to once-daily oral AVA (60 mg or 40 mg, respectively) or PBO for 5 days; the procedure was done 5 to 8 days after the last dose. The primary efficacy end point in both studies was the proportion of patients not requiring a PT or rescue procedure, and the first secondary end point was the proportion of patients achieving a PC ≥ 50 × 10(9)/L on Procedure Day. Subgroup analyses of efficacy were also conducted based on HCC status. [Table Presented] Results: Overall, AVA was superior to PBO in both cohorts in the proportion of patients not requiring a PT or rescue procedure for bleeding (Cohort 1: p < 0.0001; Cohort 2: p < 0.0001). Efficacy by HCC status was generally similar between the different treatment groups for the primary end point. Cohort 1: No HCC: AVA 68.4%, PBO 34.9%; HCC: AVA 64.3%, PBO 12.0%; Cohort 2: No HCC: AVA 91.7%, PBO 36.7%; HCC: AVA 81.3%, PBO 33.3%.

Fewer HCC patients in the Cohort 2 PBO arm reached the primary end point compared to non-HCC patients though their baseline PC was similar. Conclusion: AVA was superior to PBO in increasing PC and reducing both the proportion of patients with CLD who required a PT or rescue procedure for bleeding, and the proportion of patients who achieved a PC ≥ 50 × 10(9)/L by Procedure Day.

HCCs are characterized by high resistance to systemic therapies induced by phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity. For almost 10 years, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib was the only approved treatment for advanced HCCs in patients with preserved liver function, and until 2016, no new compounds tested in large phase III studies have led to a survival benefit. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor regorafenib, a fluorinated sorafenib analog, was the first substance that showed a significant improvement in overall survival after failure of sorafenib treatment, which subsequently led to its regulatory approval in a second-line setting in 2017. In addition, the non-inferiority of lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib opened another therapeutic first-line option in the same year. Furthermore, several other compounds showed promising results in recent phase III studies, including ramucirumab in patients with elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels as well as cabozantinib in second- and third-line settings. In addition, promising early reports of the immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab, with objective response rates of 15–20%, paved the way for immuno-oncological interventions for HCC and these will probably gain increasing attention as mono- and combination therapies. In summary, following the approval of sorafenib in 2007 and almost 10 years of therapeutic stagnation, results from recent clinical trials in first- and further-line settings for the first time demonstrated efficacy of several active compounds in advanced HCCs. Thus, a sequential approach should now be implemented in HCC treatment and will improve the survival of HCC patients.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02407990, NCT03412773)",,30805831,L626543598,10.1007/s11523-019-00624-w

Despite continuous advancements in the management of this disease, the prognosis for HCC remains inferior compared to other tumor entities. While orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and surgical resection are the only two curative treatment options, OLT remains the best treatment strategy as it not only removes the tumor but cures the underlying liver disease. As the applicability of OLT is nowadays limited by organ shortage, major liver resections—even in patients with underlying chronic liver disease—are adopted increasingly into clinical practice. Against the background of the oftentimes present chronical liver disease, locoregional therapies have also gained increasing significance. These strategies range from radiofrequency ablation and trans-arterial chemoembolization to selective internal radiation therapy and are employed in both curative and palliative intent, individually, as a bridging to transplant or in combination with liver resection. The choice of the appropriate treatment, or combination of treatments, should consider the tumor stage, the function of the remaining liver parenchyma, the future liver remnant volume and the patient’s general condition. This review aims to address the topic of multimodal treatment strategies in HCC, highlighting a multidisciplinary treatment approach to further improve outcome in these patients.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01730937)",,30909504,L2001813532,10.3390/ijms20061465

Encouraging clinical activity and manageable safety were reported in urothelial carcinoma, non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) in a multicenter phase I/II study. Safety and clinical activity in recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were evaluated in the expansion phase. Methods: Patients received 10 mg/kg of durvalumab intravenously every 2 weeks for 12 months or until confirmed progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective was safety; clinical activity was a secondary objective. Results: Sixty-two patients were enrolled and evaluable (received first dose ≥24 weeks before data cutoff). Median age was 57 years; 40.3% were human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive; 32.3% had tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥25%, and 62.9% were current/former smokers. They had a median of 2 prior systemic treatments (range, 1–13). All-causality adverse events (AEs) occurred in 98.4%; drug-related AEs occurred in 59.7% and were grade III–IV in 9.7%. There were no drug-related discontinuations or deaths. Objective response rate (blinded independent central review) was 6.5% (15.0% for PD-L1 ≥25%, 2.6% for <25%). Median time to response was 2.7 months (range, 1.2–5.5); median duration was 12.4 months (range, 3.5–20.5+). Median progression-free survival was 1.4 months; median overall survival (OS) was 8.4 months. OS rate was 62% at 6 months and 38% at 12 months (42% for PD-L1 ≥25%, 36% for <25%). Conclusions: Durvalumab safety in HNSCC was manageable and consistent with other cohorts of the study. Early, durable responses in these heavily pretreated patients warrant further investigation; phase III monotherapy and combination therapy studies are ongoing.

J Hepatol 2018), and therefore, adjuvant therapies are needed. Nivolumab (NIVO) has demonstrated durable tumor responses and a manageable safety profile in patients (pts) with advanced HCC, regardless of HCC etiology (CheckMate-040 study) (El-Khoueiry, et al. Lancet 2017). Additionally, NIVO has shown clinical benefit as adjuvant therapy in melanoma (CheckMate-238 study) (Weber, et al. NEJM 2017). This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjuvant NIVO in pts with HCC who are at high risk of recurrence after curative hepatic resection or ablation, a population for whom no effective therapies are currently available. Materials: The trial will include 530 pts aged ≥18 y with a first diagnosis of HCC (any etiology) who are at high risk for HCC recurrence after curative resection or ablation, and who have well-preserved liver function (Child-Pugh score 5 or 6), randomized (1:1) to receive NIVO (480 mg intravenous Q4W) or placebo (PBO). Additional eligibility criteria include Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, no evidence of tumor metastasis, no prior therapy for HCC (including loco-regional therapies), and no liver transplant. Pts will be treated until recurrence per blinded independent central review (BICR) assessment, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal, or for up to 1 y total duration. Survival follow-up will continue for up to 5 y. The primary endpoint is to compare recurrence-free survival, per BICR assessment. Secondary endpoints include overall survival and time to recurrence (defined as time from randomization to first documented disease recurrence).

(S25). Date of Publication: 1 Mar 2019","2019","25",,"S25",,"1 Mar 2019","BACKGROUND: With the rapid expansion of recent approvals for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC; 3 targeted therapies, 2 immuno-oncology therapies, and many more new entities in phase 3 trials) the landscape of prescribing practices and provider attitudes are evolving and largely unknown. Given the dearth of routine practice data on these newer therapies, it is important to understand how providers adopt contemporary therapies for aHCC. OBJECTIVE: To describe physician treatment selection and patterns of systemic therapy (ST) in aHCC, estimate the proportion of aHCC patients eligible for ST, define criteria for ST eligibility, and understand factors influencing ST selection. METHODS: Oncologists completed a questionnaire evaluating how they assess whether to treat with ST or best supportive care and what contributes to their treatment selection decision making for patients with aHCC. Oncologists who had managed or treated > 2 patients with aHCC over the past 2 years in a community practice setting were eligible. Physician characteristics were collected, and descriptive statistics were used to summarize responses. RESULTS: Among 50 oncologists completing the survey, mean practice time was 17 years, 38% participated in the oncology care model, 20% were rural, and there was broad U.S. geographic representation. Participating oncologists managed a mean of 22 aHCC patients over the past 2 years. Most common characteristics rendering a patient a good candidate for ST were ECOG performance status (74%), Child- Pugh grade A or B (34%), and “fewer or no comorbidities” (18%). Physicians reported that most (91%) patients considered eligible for ST would be treated with ST. Typical management of a newly diagnosed HCC patient reported by 38% of oncologists is initiating loco-regional therapy (LRT) followed by ST, while 20% of oncologists initiate and conduct sequential LRT until exhausted. When asked about factors influencing ST selection, most (78%) oncologists ranked “efficacy of regimen/agent” highest, whereas “affordability of regimen/agent” and “patient choice” were ranked lowest among 34% and 24% of physicians, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The extensive and early (20% exhausting LRT) use of ST by oncologists in this survey, if more broadly representative, has significant implications for the rapidly expanding arsenal of drug therapies for aHCC. Understanding the comparative effectiveness of these new drugs, optimum sequencing, healthcare resource use and costs will be critical to their use in a patient centric and value-based healthcare delivery model.",,,,L629428096,

Date of Publication: 1 Mar 2019","2019","3","SUPPL 1",,,"1 Mar 2019","Objective: The main purpose of this article is to examine an investigational nanomedicine and discuss the steps needed for clinical translation. For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), translating investigational therapies from the laboratory to the interventional radiology (IR) suite is complicated and expensive. We will examine the steps involved in obtaining approval of a novel drug with the low-density lipoprotein docosahexaenoic acid nanoparticle as a case study for promising preclinical results in treating a rodent model of HCC. The agent has selective cytotoxicity toward HCC cells using redox-mediated processes, showing threefold regression of tumor mass with no adverse effects on normal liver tissue. Preclinical: Nanotherapeutic created from well-known delivery systems easily tailored for desired target, size, charge, and hydrophobicity. Cellular mechanism must be shown along with efficacy and off-target effects in animal models, with comparison to nanoparticles devoid of the drug. In our case, biological effects were compared with controls in healthy rats with orthotopic tumors using both open surgical and transarterial approaches. Investigational New Drug application must be submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), describing pharmacology, manufacturing information, and clinical protocols (supplemented by an Institutional Review Board). Clinical: Initial phases assess the safety/efficacy of the drug in increasing numbers of patients, first in healthy volunteers and then in those with the disease. Phase III verifies long-term effects in randomized controlled trials. New Drug Application must be filed to allow marketing according to specific labeling. Postmarket. Surveillance after drug is on the market. FDA may request studies on specialized populations and clinicians may compare the drug to other treatments. Conclusion/Teaching Points: With the success of transarterial therapies, we can expect to see newer agents for treating HCC. At a cost of roughly $1 billion over 10 to 15 years for the development of new drugs, investigators involved in creating embolics should understand the process and special considerations in translating nanotherapeutics into clinical use.",,,,L636383748,10.1055/s-0039-1689012

Sequelae of chronic infection include cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment has become highly successful using genotype specific and more recently pan-genotypic regimens. Seven discrete genotypes of hepatitis C (HCV) had been described until late-2017 when an eighth genotype (GT), with almost identical 5ʹ untranslated region (UTR) as GT5a was described in four patients, originating from the Punjab region in India. All four cases were erroneously typed as GT5a by the VERSANT Inno-LiPA platform, but successfully treated with antiviral therapy. The first Australian report of hepatitis C genotype 8 infection is presented. A sample from a 33-year-old male from the Punjab region with abnormal liver enzymes, positive HCV antibody and viral load of 13 million IU/mL was referred to SA Pathology for genotyping. Genotyping is performed at SA Pathology by Sanger sequencing of 442 bases of the core region and if required, the 5ʹ UTR. The core region amplicon did not align with any of the HCV GT 1–7 reference genomes including the subtype 5a core region. When it was entered as a query sequence into the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), the closest match was the recently described GT8 sequences. The isolate was sent to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) for VERSANT Inno-LiPA assay, the most commonly used genotyping assay in Australia, which typed the sample as GT5a. The results of sequencing of the whole genome and the treatment implications of the misdiagnosis of HCV GT8 will be discussed. References1. Borgia SM, Hedskog C, Parhy B, et al.

We aimed to establish the efficacy of ramucirumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and α-fetoprotein concentrations of 400 ng/mL or higher. Methods: REACH-2 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 92 hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in 20 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had histologically or cytologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma, or diagnosed cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C disease, Child-Pugh class A liver disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance statuses of 0 or 1, α-fetoprotein concentrations of 400 ng/mL or greater, and had previously received first-line sorafenib. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) via an interactive web response system with a computer-generated random sequence to 8 mg/kg intravenous ramucirumab every 2 weeks or placebo. All patients received best supportive care. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, proportion of patients achieving an objective response, time to radiographic progression, safety, time to deterioration in scores on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Hepatobiliary Symptom Index 8 (FHSI-8), and time to deterioration in ECOG performance status. We also pooled individual patient data from REACH-2 with data from REACH (NCT01140347) for patients with α-fetoprotein concentrations of 400 ng/mL or greater. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat, whereas safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.

Findings: Between July 26, 2015, and Aug 30, 2017, 292 patients were randomly assigned, 197 to the ramucirumab group and 95 to the placebo group. At a median follow-up of 7·6 months (IQR 4·0–12·5), median overall survival (8·5 months [95% CI 7·0–10·6] vs 7·3 months [5·4–9·1]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·710 [95% CI 0·531–0·949]; p=0·0199) and progression-free survival (2·8 months [2·8–4·1] vs 1·6 months [1·5–2·7]; 0·452 [0·339–0·603]; p<0·0001) were significantly improved in the ramucirumab group compared with the placebo group. The proportion of patients with an objective response did not differ significantly between groups (nine [5%] of 197 vs one [1%] of 95; p=0·1697). Median time to deterioration in FHSI-8 total scores (3·7 months [95% CI 2·8–4·4] vs 2·8 months [1·6–2·9]; HR 0·799 [95% CI 0·545–1·171]; p=0·238) and ECOG performance statuses (HR 1·082 [95% CI 0·639–1·832]; p=0·77) did not differ between groups. Grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of patients in either group were hypertension (25 [13%] in the ramucirumab group vs five [5%] in the placebo group), hyponatraemia (11 [6%] vs 0) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (six [3%] vs five [5%]). Serious adverse events of any grade and cause occurred in 68 (35%) patients in the ramucirumab group and 28 (29%) patients in the placebo group. Three patients in the ramucirumab group died from treatment-emergent adverse events that were judged to be related to study treatment (one had acute kidney injury, one had hepatorenal syndrome, and one had renal failure). Interpretation: REACH-2 met its primary endpoint, showing improved overall survival for ramucirumab compared with placebo in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and α-fetoprotein concentrations of at least 400 ng/mL who had previously received sorafenib.

Date of Publication: 1 Feb 2019","2019","24",,"S3","S10","1 Feb 2019","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignancy worldwide, and is especially common in China. A total of 70%–80% of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage and can receive only palliative care. Sorafenib has been the standard of care for a decade, and promising results for regorafenib as a second-line and lenvatinib as a first-line treatment were reported only 1 or 2 years ago. FOLFOX4 was recently recommended as a clinical practice guideline by the China Food and Drug Administration. All approved systemic therapies remain unsatisfactory, with limited objective response rates and poor overall survival. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) offer great promise in the treatment of a rapidly expanding spectrum of solid tumors. Immune checkpoint molecules are involved in almost the whole process of viral-related hepatitis with cirrhosis and HCC and in the most important resistance mechanism of sorafenib. The approval of nivolumab by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on September 23, 2017, for the treatment of patients with HCC, based only on a phase I/II clinical trial, is a strong hint that immunotherapy will introduce a new era of HCC therapy. CPI-based strategies will soon be a main approach in anticancer treatment for HCC, and we will observe the rapid advances in the therapeutic use of CPIs, even in an adjuvant setting, with great interest. How shall we face the opportunities and challenges? Can we dramatically improve the prognosis of patients with HCC? This review may provide some informed guidance. Implications for Practice: Immune checkpoint molecules are involved in almost the whole process of viral-related hepatitis with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and in the most important resistance mechanism of sorafenib. As all approved systemic therapies in HCC remain unsatisfactory, checkpoint inhibitor (CPI)-based strategies will soon be a main approach in anticancer treatment for advanced stage of HCC, even in an adjuvant setting. In virus-related HCC, especially hepatitis B virus-related HCC, whether CPIs can control virus relapse should be further investigated. Combination strategies involving conventional therapies and immunotherapies are needed to increase clinical benefit and minimize adverse toxicities with regard to the underlying liver disease.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01008358, NCT01658878, NCT01853618, NCT02423343, NCT02519348, NCT02572687, NCT02576509, NCT02702401, NCT02702414, NCT02989922, NCT03006926, NCT03092895)",,30819826,L626540125,10.1634/theoncologist.2019-IO-S1-s01

Lancet. 2018). Objective: Assess biomarker analyses from REFLECT. Methods: 954 Patients with uHCC received lenvatinib or sorafenib. Serum samples (lenvatinib, n = 279; sorafenib, n = 128) were collected at baseline and during the study. Tumor response correlations (independent imaging review per mRECIST: complete/partial responses vs others) with pharmacodynamic biomarker changes used Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. VEGF, ANG2, FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23 levels (by ELISA) were analyzed by quartiles: low (0-25%), middle (25-75%), or high (75-100%). OS correlations were examined by Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier, and log-rank tests (all nominal P values). Results: Both treatments increased VEGF levels; only lenvatinib increased FGF19 and FGF23. Lenvatinib-treated responders had greater increases in FGF19 and FGF23 vs others (FGF19: 55.2% vs 18.3%, P = 0.0140; FGF23: 48.4% vs 16.4%; P = 0.0022). Higher baseline VEGF, ANG2, and FGF21 correlated with worse OS in both arms, and for patients with high baseline FGF21 (lenvatinib, n = 70; sorafenib, n = 27), OS was longer for lenvatinib vs sorafenib (median, 10.9 vs 6.8 months; HR 0.528; 95% CI 0.328-0.849; P = 0.0075; Pinteraction = 0.0397). Conclusions: Differences in biomarker changes may reflect distinct target engagements for lenvatinib and sorafenib. Increased VEGF, ANG2, and FGF21 may be prognostic for shorter OS with both treatments; increased FGF21 may be predictive for reduced OS with sorafenib.

This study examined the efficacy and safety of Lenvatinib in a real world setting. Methods: This was a retrospective, multicenter, observational study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were based on phase 3 trial, and participants were observed for at least 12 weeks. Therapeutic effect was determined using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (m-RECIST) by the eighth week. Patients received oral Lenvatinib 12 mg/day (>60 kg bodyweight) or 8 mg/day (<60 kg bodyweight). Dose interruptions followed by reductions for Lenvatinib- related toxicities were permitted. Grades of adverse events (AEs) complied with the Common terminology criteria for adverse events version 4.0. Results: All 16 cases included in this study had prior treatment history, and a median of 3.9 years had passed since the first treatment. Fatigue, hypertension, and proteinuria were identified as AEs with the highest frequencies, and were more than Grade 2. AEs could be controlled by carrying out appropriate dose reduction, interruption, and symptomatic treatment according to the protocol. In the m-RECIST evaluation at the eighth week, complete response, partial response, stable disease, and disease progression involved 0, 6, 8, and 1 case, respectively.

LEN was superior vs SOR for secondary endpoints including objective response rate (ORR) per mRECIST: 24.1% vs 9.2% by investigator and 40.6% vs 12.4% by independent review (Kudo M et al. Lancet2018). We report a posthoc responder analysis of patients (pts) who received first-line LEN in REFLECT and subsequent anticancer medication during survival follow up. Methods: In REFLECT, pts with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma were randomized 1:1 to receive first-line LEN or SOR. Objective response was defined as complete or partial response by mRECIST per investigator. Pts with disease progression and who discontinued treatment were followed for survival every 12 weeks; subsequent anticancer medication during survival follow up were recorded until time of death.

Date of Publication: 1 Feb 2019","2019","37",,,,"1 Feb 2019","Background: AFP response, defined as a decrease in serum levels of the tumor marker AFP after therapy, may be associated with improved survival of patients (pts) with HCC treated with locoregional or systemic therapy, and high baseline AFP levels may be associated with poor prognosis. In the phase III CELESTIAL trial (NCT01908426), C, an inhibitor of MET, VEGFR, and AXL, significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) versus P in pts with previously treated advanced HCC. Here we evaluate clinical outcomes with C in CELESTIAL based on AFP response or progression on treatment. Methods: 707 pts were randomized 2:1 to receive C (60 mg daily) or P. Eligible patients had a pathologic diagnosis of HCC, Child-Pugh score A, and ECOG PS ≤ 1. Pts received prior sorafenib and ≤ 2 lines of prior systemic therapy for HCC. Serum AFP levels were measured centrally at baseline and every 8 weeks thereafter. Outcomes were evaluated for pts with baseline AFP ≥ 20 ng/mL based on AFP response ( ≥ 20% decrease from baseline) or progression ( ≥ 20% increase from baseline) at Week 8. This definition of AFP response has been used in previous studies but requires further validation in large prospective studies. Results: Overall, 331 pts (70%) in the C arm and 160 (68%) in the P arm had baseline AFP ≥ 20 ng/mL; among these pts, 236 (71%) and 111 (69%), respectively, were evaluable for AFP response at week 8. Among evaluable pts, 117 pts (50%) in the C arm vs 14 (13%) in the P arm had an AFP response, and 72 (31%) vs 75 (68%) had AFP progression. Median OS with C was 16.1 mo for pts with an AFP response versus 9.1 mo for pts without a response (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.84), and median PFS with C was 7.3 mo versus 4.0 mo (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.74). For pts with AFP progression, median OS with C was 8.1 mo, and median PFS with C was 3.6 mo. Hazard ratios for OS and PFS with C also favored AFP responders over non-responders when analyzed using best response through week 24.

REACH and REACH-2 were two global, randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)- controlled multicenter, phase III studies of RAM versus PBO in patients with HCC after prior sorafenib. REACH-2 confirmed RAM treatment benefit for patients with baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL, consistent with results in a prespecified subgroup of patients in REACH with AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. Methods: Other than AFP levels, study designs and eligibility for both studies were similar. All patients received RAM (8 mg/kg) I.V. or PBO every 14 days. Pooled analyses were performed to further support the assessments of efficacy and safety in Japanese patients with baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. Results: In total, 101 Japanese patients were pooled from REACH and REACH-2 (n = 61 RAM; n = 40 PBO). Pooled baseline patient characteristics were balanced between arms including baseline AFP and etiology. As in the individual studies, improvement in OS (median OS 10.78 vs 4.47 mo; HR 0.555; 95% CI 0.348, 0.885; p = .0124) was observed. Improvements in PFS (median PFS 3.88 vs 1.41 mo; HR 0.341; 95% CI 0.212, 0.550; p < .0001), ORR (9.8% vs 2.5%, p = .1285), and disease control rate (67.2% vs 35.0%, p = .0035) were also observed.

This study describes long-term outcomes of patients with HCC and MVI treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Methods: Patients with HCC and MVI who were treated with SBRT from January 2003 to December 2016 were eligible for analysis. Patients who had extrahepatic disease or who had prior liver transplant were excluded. Demographical, clinical, and treatment variables were collected, under IRB approval. The degree of vascular invasion was quantified into two categories: main portal vein branch/IVC and distal portal/hepatic vein. Results: 128 eligible pts with HCC and MVI were treated with SBRT ( > 4.5 Gy/fraction). The median age was 61 yrs (range: 39 to 90 yrs). Underlying liver disease was hepatitis B in 23%, hepatitis C in 45%, other in 20%; no known liver disease in 12%. Baseline Child-Pugh (CP) score was A5 in 67%, A6 in 20%, B7 or higher in 13%. 35% received previous liver-directed therapies. Median HCC volume was 153.7 mL (range: 3.9 to 1,813.5 mL). Median AFP was 205 ug/L (range: 1 to 171,154 ug/L). Median SBRT dose was 33.3 Gy (range: 27 to 54 Gy) in 6 fractions. Local control at 1 year was 87.4% (95% CI 78.6 to 96.1%). SBRT dose or HCC volume were not significant on univariate analysis. Median overall survival was 18.3 months (95% CI 11.2 to 21.4 months).

Date of Publication: 1 Feb 2019","2019","37",,,,"1 Feb 2019","Background: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields), an antimitotic cancer treatment, utilizes low intensity (1-3 V/cm), intermediate frequency (100-300 kHz), alternating electric fields delivered non-invasively by transducer arrays placed on skin over tumor region. Safety of TTFields has been established in pancreatic cancer (Phase II study; PANOVA; NCT01971281). A Phase 3 study in locallyadvanced pancreatic cancer (PANOVA-3) and a phase 2 study in hepatocellular cancer are ongoing. Preclinical studies suggest that TTFields' intensity correlates with treatment efficacy. Simulations can determine the thermal safety of TTFields by evaluating tissue heating due to field absorption and resultant risk of thermal damage. We used computational simulations to study the effectiveness of field distribution and associated heating in realistic phantoms during TTFields delivery to the abdomen. Methods: Delivery of TTFields to computational phantoms of a male (DUKE 3.0), a female (ELLA 3.0) and an obese male (FATS 3.0) was simulated. For each phantom, 6-8 different transducer array layouts to the abdomen were tested. Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) levels were calculated to assess the risk of thermal damage to tissues, and compared to the SAR control level of 10 W/kg per International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines for occupational exposure (Health Physics 74 (4) 494; 1998). The field intensities were measured to determine the effectiveness of treatment delivery. Results: Altering the size and position of the arrays facilitates field intensities above the therapeutic threshold of 1 V/cm. Within the abdominal internal organs, the SAR values were generally below the ICNIRP recommended level of 10 W/kg. The maximum SAR levels did not exceed 20 W/kg. Conclusions: TTFields could be delivered at intensities above therapeutic threshold of 1 V/cm by strategizing the array size and placement. TTFields to the abdomen can be delivered to target gastrointestinal cancers without causing thermal damage to abdominal tissues. These results also indicate that TTFields delivery can be optimized in gastrointestinal cancers.",,,,L627163242,

This analysis investigated changes in AFP during treatment, as well as potential relationships with survival or progression. Methods: Patients were randomized (2:1) to RAM 8 mg/kg IV or placebo Q2W plus best supportive care until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Serum AFP levels were measured at baseline and every 3 cycles. Percent change in AFP from baseline was analyzed at each time point up to Cycle 12 with descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon rank sum test between treatment arms. AFP response was defined as ≥ 20% decrease from baseline. The association between AFP progression and radiographic progression in each time interval was assessed by odds ratio [OR] and Fisher's exact test. Time to AFP progression and time to radiographic progression (TTP) were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between treatment arms using a stratified log-rank test. AFP progression was defined as ≥ 20% increase from baseline. Hazard ratio (HR) was generated using a stratified Cox regression model. Results: AFP response was significantly higher with RAM compared with placebo (42.1% vs 10.5%, p < 0.0001). Overall survival (OS) was longer in patients with AFP response (13.5 months) than in patients without (6.7 months), irrespective of treatment (HR 0.470, p < 0.0001).

Since the relationship between OR and OS in phase III HCC studies is unclear, we explored the relationship between OR and OS in REFLECT. Methods: OR assessed by investigators per mRECIST were used to analyze the association between OR and OS of pts treated with LEN or SOR. The median OS of responders (CR or PR) was compared to that of nonresponders (SD, PD, or UNK/NE) irrespective of treatment. Landmark analyses were performed by OR status at several fixed time points as sensitivity analyses, and the effect on OS was evaluated by Cox regression with OR as a time-dependent covariate, with other prognostic factors. Results: Median OS was 22.4 months for responders and 11.4 months for nonresponders.

NBTXR3 is characterized by a single intratumor/intralesional (IL) administration and fits into standard RT schedule with no change in patient's flow, treatment protocol or equipment. Herein the preliminary results of a phase I/II clinical trial evaluating this combination in patients (pts) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver metastasis (mets). Methods: HCC and liver mets patients were treated with an IL injection of NBTXR3 followed by SBRT (15 Gy∗3 fractions). The phase I part of the trial follows a 3+3 dose escalation design at dose levels of NBTXR3 corresponding to 10%, 15%, 22%, 33% of the baseline tumor volume. This study aims primarily to identify the Recommended Dose and the incidence of early Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) of NBTXR3 activated by SBRT. Secondary endpoints include assessment of global safety profile, liver function evaluated by Child-Pugh score (CPS), AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), and response rate (mRECIST/RECIST 1.1). Results: Enrollment is at the last dose level, 33%, and completed at 10% (6 pts), 15% (4 pts) and 22% (4 pts). So far, no early DLTs nor severe adverse events related to NBTXR3 were observed. Both CPS and APRI did not reveal important variations in accordance to NBTXR3 low toxicity. The best observed target lesions responses, among 7 evaluable HCC pts for response (mRECIST), were: 3 complete responses, 3 partial responses (PR) and 1 stable disease (SD) and among 5 evaluable liver mets pts: 1 PR, 3 SD and 1 progressive disease (RECIST 1.1). Conclusions: NBTXR3 is well tolerated at the 22% dose level with an overall positive safety profile. This innovative approach might constitute a valuable solution for pts with liver tumors beyond standard treatment lines.

Results: Overall, 70% of pts had normal hepatic function by NCI-ODWG criteria; 28% had mild, 1% had moderate, and <1% had severe hepatic dysfunction. A 2-compartment model with firstorder elimination and dual first- and zero-order absorption processes adequately described the data. As in the previous model, the MTC population was the only cancer type to have a notable difference in C PK, with ~90% increase in apparent clearance (CL/F) versus HV and pts with other cancers including HCC. For a White male, CL/F was estimated as 2.48 L/hr and apparent volume of the central compartment (Vc/F) as 212 L. Inter-individual variability was ~46% for CL/F and ~67% for Vc/F. Other demographic covariates were predicted to have a small to moderate impact on C CL/F. Liver dysfunction, per NCIODWG criteria, had no discernable effect on C CL/F. Conclusions: C exposure at an equivalent daily dose is predicted to be similar in pts with several cancer types including advanced HCC with mild liver dysfunction.",,,,L627164290,

CELESTIAL was stopped early for benefit at the second interim analysis. This post hoc analysis estimated the incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued in CELESTIAL. Methods: Health utility was elicited at each study visit using the EQ-5D-5L quality of life questionnaire. (completed by 82-100% of patients overall). UK crosswalk tariffs were applied for health states. Cumulative QALYs by patient were calculated by linear interpolation; for patients who were censored (31% of patients; including 9% within 100 days of randomization), the last observed utility value was carried forward to study end. The difference in restricted mean QALYs was calculated using generalized linear models, accounting for baseline utility, and with 0.06-0.08 QALYs considered the minimal important difference. Results: At day 50 after randomization (acute treatment phase), cabo was associated with a small reduction in mean total QALYs vs pbo (difference -0.003; 95% CI -0.005 to -0.002; p ≤ 0.001; n = 601 [cabo, n = 389; pbo, n = 212]). At day 100, there was a numerical benefit in mean total QALYs for cabo (difference +0.007; 95% CI -0.001 to 0.015; p = 0.103; n = 627 [cabo, n = 410; pbo, n = 217]), and at day 150 the difference was +0.032 QALYs (95% CI 0.017 to 0.047; p ≤ 0.001; n = 629 [cabo, n = 412; pbo, n = 217]) in favor of cabo. Over the entire follow-up, patients randomized to cabo accrued a mean of +0.092 (95% CI 0.016 to 0.169; p = 0.018; n = 700 [cabo, n = 465; pbo, n = 235]) additional QALYs compared with those receiving pbo. Using alternative Devlin weights for health states, the mean accrued QALYs with cabo was +0.115 vs pbo (95% CI 0.032 to 0.198; p = 0.007).

Lenvatinib is approved in several major markets for the first line systemic treatment of uHCC. The most common adverse events (AEs) in pts treated with LEN were hypertension and diarrhea. In addition, LEN showed a different AE profile from that of SOR. Pts who received LEN experienced more instances of hypertension, proteinuria, dysphonia, and hypothyroidism than patients who received SOR. Recently, hypertension in LENtreated pts with differentiated thyroid cancer was shown to be correlated with improved efficacy. Here we report the post hoc analysis exploring whether AEs associated with LEN were correlated with longer OS in REFLECT. Methods: 478 Pts were randomized to receive LEN (12 mg/d for actual body weight ≥ 60 kg or 8 mg/d for actual body weight < 60 kg). Subgroup analyses were conducted based on whether pts treated with LEN experienced any-grade AEs of interest (AEIs). OS was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The AEIs in pts treated with LEN were hypertension (42%), diarrhea (38%), proteinuria (24%), dysphonia (24%), and hypothyroidism (16%). OS was longer in pts who had several AEs of interest than in those who did not (table). Conclusions: In pts treated with LEN, the occurrence of hypertension, diarrhea, proteinuria, or hypothyroidism was generally associated with longer OS in pts with uHCC in this post hoc exploratory analysis.

A few results from a large sample size cohort of LEN therapy in real world practice has been reported. Therefore, we performed a retrospective nationwide multicenter study. Methods: A total of 116 uHCC patients received LEN from March 2018 at 14 sites in Japan were registered. Tumour assessments in accordance with RECICT ver1.1 and modified RECIST were done using dynamic CT or MRI within 48 weeks and every 68 weeks thereafter. Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the CTCAE ver4.0. Results:Median age was 72 (4691) years, 88 (75.9%) patients were male, and median body weight was 60 (3094) kg. The baseline liver function was Child-Pugh class A in 106 (91.4%) patients. Seventythree (62.9%) patients were BCLC stage C. As the 2ndline therapy (after sorafenib), 28 (24.1%) patients received LEN and 17 (14.7%) patients did as the 3rdline (after regorafenib). Median observation time was 2.5 months and one patient died from HCC progression. The imaging findings of 49 (42.2%) patients were evaluated at 48weeks. Based on mRECIST, CR was shown in 3 (6.1%), PR in 14 (28.6%), SD in 23 (46.9%), and PD in 6 (12.2%). In the 3 patients, target lesions of liver showed PR, however bone metastases had progressed.

In this Phase 3 study, we evaluated sofosbuvir–velpatasvir with or without ribavirin for 12 weeks in patients with any HCV genotype and decompensated cirrhosis [Child–Pugh–Turcotte (CPT) class B or C] in Japan. Methods: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive sofosbuvir–velpatasvir with or without ribavirin for 12 weeks. Randomization was stratified by CPT class and genotype. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks following completion of treatment (SVR12) was the primary efficacy endpoint. Results: Of the 102 patients enrolled, 57% were treatment naive, 78% and 20% had genotype 1 and 2 HCV infection, respectively, and 77% and 20% had CPT class B and C cirrhosis, respectively, at baseline. Overall, 61% of patients were female and the mean age was 66 years (range 41–83). SVR12 rates were 92% (47/51) in each group. Among patients who achieved SVR12, 26% had improved CPT class from baseline to posttreatment week 12.

Fortunately, during the recent 2 years, between 2017 and 2018, four drugs (regorafenib, lenvatinib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab) were found to be effective and tolerable for patients with HCC as the first- or second-line therapy. Regorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, has a similar structure to sorafenib, and was shown to improve the survival of patients who progressed after sorafenib treatment compared to the placebo control. According to the phase III trial of regorafenib, it became the first approved systemic therapy for patients with progression after sorafenib. Lenvatinib is also a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), and in a phase III trial comparing sorafenib and lenvatinib, the primary end-point of non-inferior survival was met. Based on the trial results, lenvatinb has become another systemic therapy for treatment-na?ve patients with advanced HCC. Cabozantinib is a dual inhibitor of Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition factor/Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor2, and was shown to prolong the overall survival in patients who progressed after sorafenib compared to the placebo. Ramucirumab is a monoclonal antibody to inhibit a single target of VEGFR2. First, this drug failed to improve the survival of patients who progressed after sorafenib failure. On the other hand, it was effective in patients with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL, In a subsequent clinical trial that enrolled only patients with AFP ≥400 ng/mL, ramucirumab was also found to improve the overall survival compared to placebo. Thus, ramucirumab became the first biomarker-driven systemic treatment.

NAFLD is pathologically classified as non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) based on the existence of ballooned hepatocytes, although the states have been known to transform into each other. Moreover, since the detection of ballooned hepatocytes may be difficult with limited biopsied specimens, its clinical significance needs reconsideration. Repeated liver biopsy to assess histological NAFLD activity for therapeutic response is also impractical, creating the need for body fluid biomarkers and less invasive imaging modalities. Recent longitudinal observational studies have emphasized the importance of advanced fibrosis as a determinant of NAFLD outcome. Thus, identifying predictors of fibrosis progression and developing better screening methods will enable clinicians to isolate high-risk NAFLD patients requiring early intensive intervention. Despite the considerable heterogeneity of NAFLD with regard to underlying disease, patient age, and fibrosis stage, several clinical trials are underway to develop a first-in-class drug. In this review, we summarize the present status and future direction of NAFLD/NASH research towards solving unmet medical needs.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00994682, NCT02704403, NCT03028740, NCT03053050, NCT03053063)",,30670907,L2001466543,10.3748/wjg.v25.i2.163

In particular, recombinant vaccinia viruses (VV) hold great promise as interventional agents. In this article, we first summarize the current understanding of virus biology and viral genes involved in host-virus interactions to further improve the utility of these agents in therapeutic applications. We then discuss recent findings from basic and clinical studies using VV as cancer vaccines and oncolytic immunotherapies. Despite encouraging results gleaned from translational studies in animal models, clinical trials implementing VV vectors alone as cancer vaccines have yielded largely disappointing results. However, the combination of VV vaccines with alternate forms of standard therapies has resulted in superior clinical efficacy. For instance, combination regimens using TG4010 (MVA-MUC1-IL2) with first-line chemotherapy in advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer or combining PANVAC with docetaxel in the setting of metastatic breast cancer have clearly provided enhanced clinical benefits to patients. Another novel cancer vaccine approach is to stimulate anti-tumor immunity via STING activation in Batf3-dependent dendritic cells (DC) through the use of replication-attenuated VV vectors. Oncolytic VVs have now been engineered for improved safety and superior therapeutic efficacy by arming them with immune-stimulatory genes or pro-apoptotic molecules to facilitate tumor immunogenic cell death, leading to enhanced DC-mediated cross-priming of T cells recognizing tumor antigens, including neoantigens. Encouraging translational and early phase clinical results with Pexa-Vec have matured into an ongoing global phase III trial for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Combinatorial approaches, most notably those using immune checkpoint blockade, have produced exciting pre-clinical results and warrant the development of innovative clinical studies. Finally, we discuss major hurdles that remain in the field and offer some perspectives regarding the development of next generation VV vectors for use as cancer therapeutics.",,,30626434,L625833312,10.1186/s40425-018-0495-7

However, there is a paucity of data on their performance in American populations. Methods: We conducted a phase 3 biomarker study (prospective-specimen collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation) during 08/2014-10/2018. We enrolled patients with cirrhosis and no prior HCC in a 6-month surveillance program consisting of liver imaging (mostly ultrasound) and AFP. HCC was diagnosed according to American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria. Blood samples were prospectively collected every 6 months and were analyzed for AFP, AFP L-3, DCP in a retrospective blinded fashion. We calculated sensitivity and false positive rate (FPR) for detecting HCC using pre-specified cutoffs. (AFP>20 ng/mL. AFP-L3>10%, DCP>2 ng/mL). We also combined the 3 biomarkers with age and gender in the GALAD score and chose the cut-off> -0.63 as described by Berhane. Last, we calculated an optimized cutoff based on the combination of the triple biomarkers estimated from the 6-month risk prediction model for development of HCC. For easier comparisons, we also calculated sensitivity at a fixed FPR of 10%. Controls were patients with cirrhosis under surveillance who did not develop HCC. Results: A total of 676 patients contributed to a total of 1816 surveillance episodes, of whom 45 patients developed HCC. The analysis included 39 HCC cases with complete information on biomarkers before HCC development and 562 controls with consistently negative imaging. The mean age of the overall cohort was 63.6 years and 98% were men. Cirrhosis etiology was HCV in 72%, alcohol 60%, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in 22%. At the time of diagnosis, the mean tumor size was 2.1 cm (standard deviation, SD 0.9), and 69% of patients had only one HCC nodule. The sensitivity of all three biomarkers combined was higher than using any of the markers alone; however, this occurred in parallel with an increase in FPR. (Table). GALAD score had higher sensitivity than the combination of trip3le markers but at the cost of higher FPR. A cutoff for the optimized combination of triple biomarkers based on maximizing the Youden index achieved the same sensitivity as GALAD with a lower FPR. Conclusions: In American patients with cirrhosis from different etiologies, the use of triple biomarkers (AFP, AFP-3, DCP) results in a considerable improvement over AFP alone in the sensitivity for HCC detection but may also result in an increase in false positive results. Our data show that refinement of AFP, AFP-3, DCP cutoffs can further increase the accuracy of triple biomarker combination for early HCC detection.

Recently, the Phase III REFLECT trial proved lenvatinib not inferior to sorafenib, potentially establishing a new standard of care in this setting. The study showed that both have similar overall survivals, yet with longer time to progression for lenvatinib. Currently, the selection of one or other is not based on clinical or biological parameters for this reason we performed a network meta-analysis and we also analyzed the REFLECT trial and its implications in the current and future clinical practice. Materials and methods: We performed the meta-analysis according to the Prisma statement recommendations. HR was the measure of association for time to progression and overall survival. The pooled analysis of HR was performed using a random effect model, fixing a 5% error as index of statistical significance. Results: For HBV-positive patients, there was a clear trend in favor of lenvatinib over sorafenib (HR 0.82 95% credible interval [CrI] 0.60-1.15). For HCV-positive no differences between lenvatinib and sorafenib were observed (HR 0.91 95% CrI 0.41-2.01). The data showed that lenvatinib could be the best drug for HBV-positive patients in 59% of cases compared to only 1% of patients treated with sorafenib.

Date of Publication: 2019","2019","25","2","172","180","2019","Despite all these exciting developments, there remain some unmet needs in the management for patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). As majority of CHB patients are going to use oral nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) for decades, Safety profile of NAs is of no doubt an important issue. The newest nucleotide analogue tenofovir alafenamide is potent in terms of viral suppression, together with favourable renal and bone safety profile. Biochemical response as reflected by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization is recently found to be prognostically important. Patients who achieved ALT normalization have reduced the risk of hepatic events by 49%. Functional cure as reflected by hepatitis B surface antigen seroclearance not only implies patients may stop NA treatment, it also confers to a reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and other hepatic events.

Date of Publication: 2019","2019","153","5","242","248","2019","Lenvatinib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that targets VEGF receptors 1–3, FGF receptors 1–4, PDGF receptor α, RET, and KIT. The preclinical studies of lenvatinib for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suggest that lenvatinib exerts the potent antitumor effect on the basis of the inhibitory actions on VEGF and FGF-induced tumor angiogenesis and on FGF-induced tumor cell growth. Phase I and II trials were conducted in Japan and Korea evaluating the maximal tolerated dose, efficacy, and safety of lenvatinib for HCC patients and have produced promising results. Considering the relationship between body weight, AUC and dose in HCC patients, the recommended starting dose was determined to be 8 mg/day for patients weighing lower than 60 kg and 12 mg/day for patients of 60 kg and higher. A phase III REFLECT study have demonstrated that the non-inferiority of lenvatinib to sorafenib in overall survival was confirmed and that lenvatinib was significantly superior to sorafenib in the analysis of progression-free survival and response rate. Based on these results, lenvatinib has been approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable HCC in Japan, US, EU and others this year. Clinical studies of lenvatinib combination therapy with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and with immune checkpoint inhibitors are currently on-going. Because of the potent antitumor effect, lenvatinib may change treatment strategy for HCC patients in the future.",,,31092758,L2002176348,10.1254/fpj.153.242

A fine powder formulation of cisplatin and the new platinum agent miriplatin became standard medicines in addition to anthracyclines in transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in Japan. Recent prospective and retrospective studies supported the usefulness of platinum agents as a chemotherapeutic at the time of varied TACE therapy. Although balloon-occluded TACE is an effective therapy for localized HCC and drug-eluting microspheres seemed to show a higher response rate in certain HCCs, the definite advantages of those procedures still remain uncertain. Intermediate stage HCC, or Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B, is regarded as a heterogeneous category with a wide spectrum of tumors and patients, and several subclassifications of the stage have been proposed to show different prognoses; there are also different recommended therapies in each subgroup. Authors have subclassified patients based on combinations of tumor size, tumor number, and liver function, with or without performance status. Because of differences of available medical resources and techniques in treatment procedures between countries, the most ideal and useful subgrouping remains inconclusive at present. Recently, a few systemic chemotherapies proved to be effective for advanced stage HCC in phase III studies: lenvatinib as the first line of therapy, and regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab as second-line therapy.

The phase III SHARP trial showed a median time-to-progression (mTTP) of 5.5 months, overall response rate (ORR) of 2%, and median overall survival (mOS) of 10.7 months with sorafenib. FOLFOX4 has shown modest activity in advanced HCC. We evaluated the combination of sorafenib and modified (m)FOLFOX in a single-arm, multicenter phase II study. Patients and Methods: The study included Child–Pugh A patients with advanced HCC and no prior systemic therapies. Patients received sorafenib 400 mg twice a day for 2 weeks, followed by concurrent mFOLFOX [5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 1,200 mg/m(2)/day for 46 hours, leucovorin 200 mg/m(2), and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) biweekly]. The primary endpoint was mTTP with an alternative hypothesis of 7 months, and secondary endpoints included ORR, mOS, and circulating biomarkers. Results: The study enrolled 40 patients: HCV/EtOH/HBV, 43%/28%/13%; Child–Pugh A5, 70%. Notable grade 3/4 adverse events (AE) included AST/ALT elevation (28%/ 15%), diarrhea (13%), hyperbilirubinemia (10%), hand–foot syndrome (8%), and bleeding (8%). mTTP was 7.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.4–8.9], ORR 18%, and mOS 15.1 months (7.9–16.9).

Shorter TTP was associated with high baseline sVEGFR1. Shorter TTP and OS were associated with increases in Tregs and CD56(Dim) natural killer (NK) cells after sorafenib alone and plasma sMET after combination treatment (all P < 0.05). Conclusions: Sorafenib þ mFOLFOX met the prespecified endpoint with encouraging efficacy but moderate hepatotoxicity.

Cabozantinib is an oral inhibitor of these kinase pathways, and hence has found its use in treatment of multiple malignancies. However, it has several side effects that can limit tolerance amongst patients. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) to determine the risk of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) events in patients with advanced solid tumors treated with cabozantinib. Methods: We systematically conducted a comprehensive literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE databases, and meeting abstracts through September 30, 2018. Phase 3 trials that mention HRQOL events like pain, arthralgia, fatigue, and reduced appetite as adverse effects were incorporated in the analysis. Mantel-Haenszel method was used to calculate the estimated pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. Random effects model was applied. Results: 4 phase 3 RCTs with a total of 2,703 patients with medullary thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma were eligible. Studies comparing cabozantinib (C) vs everolimus, C vs placebo, C vs prednisone were included in the analysis. The relative risks of all-grade side effects were as follows: fatigue, 1.378 (95% CI: 1.236-1.536; P<.0001); asthenia, 1.704 (95% CI: 1.190-2.441; P=.004); reduced appetite, 2.088 (95% CI: 1.471-2.964; P<.0001); back pain, 1.047 (95% CI: 0.871-1.259; P=.626); pain in limbs, 1.444 (95% CI: 1.128-1.847; P=.004); arthralgia, 0.982 (95% CI: 0.707-1.363; P=.912). The RR of high-grade side effects were as follows: fatigue, 1.937 (95% CI: 1.483-2.528; P<.0001); asthenia, 2.211 (95% CI: 1.536-3.184; P<.0001); reduced appetite, 4.329 (95% CI: 2.372-7.900; P<.0001); back pain, 1.227 (95% CI: 0.738-2.040; P=.431); pain in limbs, 2.933 (95% CI: 1.127-7.635; P=.028); arthralgia, 0.820 (95% CI: 0.394-1.709; P=.597).

Date of Publication: 2019","2019","28",,"14","15","2019","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer globally and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide (World Cancer Research Fund International). More than 90 % of HCCs arise in patients with underlying cirrhosis. Thus, the treatment approach of HCC depends on the stage and extent of disease, the severity of the underlying liver disease and the overall performance status of the patient. Treatment consists of five strategies: 1. surgery (resection and liver transplantation), 2. locoregional procedures (ablation and transarterial embolization), 3. systemic therapies 4. immunotherapy and 5. best supportive care (BSC). Especially, the systemic treatment for HCC has changed dramatically after the demonstration of a survival benefit with sorafenib in 2007 (SHARP trial and Asia-Pacific trial). Currently, there are several first line - sorafenib and lenvatinib - and second line - regorafenib, cabozantinib and ramucirumab - treatments that have shown a survival benefit in HCC. In a phase 3 trial (REFLECT), lenvatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in patients with untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and represents an alternative to sorafenib in the first line setting. In April 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved regorafenib for patients with HCC who have been treated with sorafenib and showed progress after treatment with first-line sorafenib. In a phase 3 trial (RESORCE), regorafenib significantly improved overall survival vs placebo. Cabozantinib is a dual inhibitor of MET/VEGFR2 in tumors that has been shown in the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial to prolong overall survival in patients with advanced HCC who progressed on sorafenib. Another category of agents that will provide new future treatment options are immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 antibodies, which kill cancer cells via a unique mechanism of action, involving immune responses. The final results of the ongoing immunotherapybased clinical trials for HCC are still awaited. Immunotherapy through immune checkpoint inhibition may have a large impact on HCC management in the future. In advanced HCC, PD-1 inhibition has shown clinical activity in second line and is now being tested in first line setting. In addition, combination therapy using an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a targeted therapy is another new therapeutic approach which is also currently under investigation. In the CHECKMATE 040 trial, a phase I/II trial that enrolled patients with advanced HCC, nivolumab (an anti-PD1 agent) showed a manageable safety profile and a response rate of 20% with a median duration of response of 9.9 months in the dose expansion phase compared to a response rate of 15% for a median duration of 17 months in the dose-escalation phase. Based on these results, nivolumab was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for sorafenib-experienced HCC. In May 2017, the FDA approved pembrolizumab for the treatment of any solid tumor confirmed to have high microsatellite instability or deficient mismatch repair. Pembrolizumab received accelerated approval by the FDA for sorafenib-experienced HCC based on an ORR of 17%, with a duration of response of ≥ 9 months reported in 77% of patients in KEYNOTE 224, a single-arm phase II trial that included patients after sorafenib progression or intolerance. In addition, and of clinical relevance, single agents and combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors are being tested in less advanced patients including patients in the intermediate and early stages. In view of the new options in the treatment of HCC, adequate selection of a therapeutic strategy ideally based on specific biomarkers will become an important future challenge. For individualized patient care, genomic alterations identified in targetable genes will be useful to identify patients with HCC who could benefit from specific targeted therapy and immunotherapy.

Since the approval of the first commercial CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab in 2011 for the treatment of melanoma, research and drug development in this field has accelerated massively. In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first PD-1 targeting agent, namely pembrolizumab, shortly followed by nivolumab. Areas covered: Nivolumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody which is approved for multiple advanced malignancies, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, squamous head and neck cancer, and urothelial carcinoma. In September 2017, nivolumab was approved by the FDA for liver cancer as a second line treatment after failure of sorafenib based on the data of the multi-cohort phase 1/2 trial CheckMate-040. This article reviews the concept of immunotherapy in liver cancer with focus on nivolumab. Expert commentary: Immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma is safe and is a new treatment option for patients with advanced stage disease besides sorafenib and regorafenib in the US. Randomized phase III trials of nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab and tislelizumab as mono- or combination-therapy are ongoing.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01658878, NCT02423343, NCT02562755, NCT02576509, NCT02715531, NCT02837029, NCT02859324, NCT03033446, NCT03071094, NCT03143270, NCT03257761, NCT03298451, NCT03412773, NCT03434379)",20180743551,30304963,L624533872,10.1080/14737140.2018.1535315

Materials and Methods: From February 2012 to December 2015, 45 (90)Y resin microspheres RE procedures were performed for HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B/C; n = 15/30). Area under the dose-volume histograms (AUDVHs) were calculated from 3D voxel-based dosimetry to measure (90)Y dose deposition. Factors associated with tumor control (ie, complete/partial response or stable disease on Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) at 6 months were investigated. PFS and OS analyses were performed (Kaplan-Meier). Toxicity was assessed by occurrence of radioembolization-induced liver disease (REILD). Results: Tumor control rate was 40.5% (17/42). Complete tumor targeting (odds ratio = 36.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.83–747; P <.001) and AUDVH(tumor) (odds ratio = 1.027; 95% confidence interval, 1.002–1.071; P =.033) independently predicted tumor control. AUDVH(tumor) ≥ 61 Gy predicted tumor control with 76.5% sensitivity and 75% specificity.

Fibrosis might progress to cirrhosis and predisposes to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but is also associated with extrahepatic morbidity and mortality in NAFLD/NASH. The improved understanding of pathogenic mechanisms underlying chronic inflammation and fibrogenesis in the liver prompted recent advances in antifibrotic therapies. Areas covered: We review recent advances in antifibrotic therapy, of which most are currently tested in clinical trials for NAFLD or NASH. This explains the manifold metabolic pathways as antifibrotic targets, including farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonism (obeticholic acid, nonsteroidal FXR agonists), acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibition, peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor agonism (elafibranor, lanifibranor, saroglitazar), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 or FGF-19 activation. Other antifibrotic drug candidates target cell death or inflammation, such as caspase (emricasan) or ASK1 inhibitors (selonsertib), galectin-3 inhibitors and reducing inflammatory macrophage recruitment by blocking chemokine receptors CCR2/CCR5 (cenicriviroc). Expert commentary: The tremendous advances in translational and clinical research fuels the hope for efficacious antifibrotic therapies within the next 5 years.

Although sorafenib expanded the treatment options for extrahepatic spread (EHS) and vascular invasion, making long-term survival of patients with advanced disease achievable to a certain extent, new molecular-targeted agents are being developed as alternatives to sorafenib due to shortcomings such as its low response rate and high toxicity. Every single one of the many drugs developed during the 10-year period from 2007 to 2016 was a failure. However, during the two-year period from 2017 through 2018, four drugs—regorafenib, lenvatinib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab—emerged successfully from clinical trials in quick succession and became available for clinical use. The efficacy of combination therapy with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus sorafenib was also first demonstrated in 2018. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been applied to HCC treatment and many phase III clinical trials are ongoing, not only on monotherapy with nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and tislelizumab, but also on combination therapy with checkpoint inhibitors, programmed death-1 (PD-1) or PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody plus a molecular targeted agent (bevacizumab) or the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibody, tremelimumab.

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2018","2018","132",,,,"1 Nov 2018","Background: Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) is a multi-systemic disorder resulting from deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme acid β-glucosidase leading to lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide (GL-1), primarily in macrophages (Gaucher cells). Thrombocytopenia, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and skeletal disease are common presenting symptoms, and hematologists often identify and manage the disease. Eliglustat, an oral substrate reduction therapy, is a first-line treatment for adults with GD1 who have extensive, intermediate, or poor CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotypes (>90% of patients). The clinical trial program for eliglustat is the largest to date for Gaucher disease, and encompasses 2 trials in treatment-naïve patients, 1 trial in stable patients switching to eliglustat after long-term enzyme replacement therapy (the historic standard of care), and a dose regimen study in mostly switch patients. Methods: We analyzed pooled treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) data from all 393 patients with GD1 from 29 countries who received at least 1 eliglustat dose in 4 completed clinical trials sponsored by Sanofi Genzyme: Phase 2 (NCT003581 50, N = 26), Phase 3 ENGAGE (NCT00891 202, N = 40), Phase 3 ENCORE (NCT009431 11, N = 157), and Phase 3 EDGE (NCT01 074944, N = 170). Results: Mean overall treatment duration in all 393 patients from the 4 completed trials was 3.6 years (maximum: 9.3 years), representing 1 400 patient-years of eliglustat exposure. Overall, 81% (n = 31 9) of patients remained in their trial until the availability of commercial eliglustat or study completion. Twenty-five (6%) patients withdrew due to AEs, including 9 patients (2%) with AEs considered related to eliglustat: mild thrombocytopenia (1 patient); mild ventricular tachycardia (1 patient); mild vertigo (1 patient); mild lethargy and mild exfoliative rash (1 patient); mild nausea, mild headache, and moderate anemia (1 patient); moderate arrhythmia (1 patient); moderate palpitations (1 patient); moderate gastroesophageal reflux disease and moderate dyspepsia (1 patient); severe upper abdominal pain (1 patient). Other reasons for study withdrawals were: patient wished to withdraw (n = 25, 6%), pregnancy (n = 1 5, 4%), noncompliance (n = 3, 1%), and ""other"" (n = 6, 2%). There were 2 on-treatment deaths, neither of which were considered related to eliglustat (downhill skiing accident and cardiac arrest due to hemorrhage after blunt abdominal trauma). Most AEs were mild or moderate (97%) in severity and considered unrelated to eliglustat (86%). Four AEs considered related to eliglustat were reported in ≥5% of patients: dyspepsia (6%), headache (5%), abdominal pain upper (5%), and dizziness (5%). Most of these common related AEs were mild or moderate, occurred only once per patient, and lasted less than 2 weeks. A total of 77 (20%) patients reported at least 1 serious AE, the majority of which were due to hospitalizations for intercurrent illnesses (e.g., appendicitis) and underlying diseases for which Gaucher patients are at increased risk (e.g., fracture, joint dislocation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cholecystitis). Eight patients (2%) had at least 1 serious AE considered related by th investigator: ventricular tachycardia; atrioventricular block and atrioventricular block second degree; peripheral neuropathy; intestinal obstr syncope (2 patients); syncope and muscular weakness; arrhythmia. Most were mild or moderate, recovered/resolved, and did not lead to study withdrawal. Most reported cardiac AEs were findings detected in asymptomatic patients during protocol-defined periodic 24 hour Holter monitoring, w(Ju)e(m)re(p) c(to)lassified as mild, and did not lead to study withdrawal. No clinically significant prolongations of the QTcF interval were observed during extensive electrocardiographic and Holter monitoring in the clinical studies. No differences were observed for the overall frequency of AEs by age group, CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype, or upper 10th percentile for plasma eliglustat exposure. The proportion of patients reporting AEs decreased over time on eliglustat. Conclusions: This pooled analysis of AE data from one Phase 2 and three Phase 3 completed eliglustat trials demonstrates long-term safety and tolerability of eliglustat in the treatment of adults with GD1.",,,,L626415512,10.1182/blood-2018-99-118319

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2018","2018","29",,,,"1 Nov 2018","Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common causes of cancer death in the world. Sorafenib is the only molecular targeted agent approved as the first line therapy for advanced HCC. After failure of sorafenib, there are regorafenib and nivolumab being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, but the price and side effects of these 2 drugs limit their clinical application. Recently, lenvatinib has showed higher response rate (RR) and better progression free survival (PFS) than sorafenib as the first line therapy for advanced HCC in a randomized phase III trial, but the therapeutic effect of lenvatinib after sorafenib is not clear. Methods: From Jul. 2017, we started to prescribe lenvatinib to patients with advanced HCC whose tumor progressed after sorafenib, who did not fit the indications of sorafenib or who could not tolerate with sorafenib. The initial dosage of lenvatinib was 10 mg daily. Tumor response was evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was defined as the time from the start of lenvatinib to discontinuation for any reason, including disease progression, treatment toxicity, patient preference, or death. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the start of lenvatinib to death. Clinical data and therapeutic effect were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results: From Jul. 2017 to Feb. 2018, there were 30 cases of advanced HCC who received lenvatinib as the salvage therapy. No patient got complete response. Response rate was 26.7% (8/30), and disease control rate was 60% (RR +stable disease, 18/30). Previous resistance to sorafenib did not influence the response to lenvatinib. The median TTF was 3.7 months, median OS was 5.9 months and 6-month survival rate was 53.8%. Side effects were mostly mild and manageable. Conclusions: From this real world experience, it showed that lenvatinib has clinical anticancer activity in patients with pretreated advanced HCC. Lenvatinib can be considered not only as the first line therapy for advanced HCC but also can be an effective and safe salvage therapy after sorafenib failure for advanced HCC.",,,,L627304387,10.1093/annonc/mdy432.034

TTP, determined retrospectively, was defined as the time from randomization to radiological progression or clinical deterioration attributed to cancer progression. Results: Based on the intent-to-treat population, 222 of 470 pts (47%) in the C arm and 27 of 237 pts (11%) in the P arm had any reduction in SOD from baseline as best response. Thirtynine of 470 pts in the C arm (8%) and 3 of 237 pts (1%) in the P arm had ≥30% reduction in SOD as best response. In the C arm, 9% (26/278) of pts with baseline AFP <400 ng/mL and 7% (13/192) of pts with AFP ≥400 ng/mL achieved a ≥ 30% reduction in SOD. Overall, 109 of 470 pts (23%) in the C arm and 13 of 237 pts (5%) in the P arm had a ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in AFP levels. Median TTP was 5.4 mo with C vs 1.9 mo with P (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.34- 0.49). Conclusions: C is associated with improved TTP, greater rates of target lesion regression, and AFP response compared with P in pts with previously treated advanced HCC.",,,,L627304618,10.1093/annonc/mdy432

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2018","2018","29",,,,"1 Nov 2018","Background: Despite significant improvements in the treatment of early HCC, curative therapies remain associated with high recurrence rates (≈70% at 5 y) (EASL. J Hepatol 2018), and therefore, adjuvant therapies are needed. Nivolumab (NIVO) has demonstrated durable tumor responses and a manageable safety profile in patients (pts) with advanced HCC, regardless of HCC etiology (CheckMate-040 study) (El-Khoueiry, et al. Lancet 2017). Additionally, NIVO has shown clinical benefit as adjuvant therapy in melanoma (CheckMate- 238 study) (Weber, et al. NEJM 2017). This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjuvant NIVO in pts with HCC who are at high risk of recurrence after curative hepatic resection or ablation, a population for whom no effective therapies are currently available. Trial design: The trial will include 530 pts aged ≥18 y with a first diagnosis of HCC (any etiology) who are at high risk for HCC recurrence after curative resection or ablation, and who have well-preserved liver function (Child-Pugh score 5 or 6), randomized (1:1) to receive NIVO (480 mg intravenous Q4W) or placebo (PBO). Additional eligibility criteria include Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, no evidence of tumor metastasis, no prior therapy for HCC (including loco-regional therapies), and no liver transplant. Pts will be treated until recurrence per blinded independent central review (BICR) assessment, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal, or for up to 1 y total duration. Survival follow-up will continue for up to 5 y. The primary endpoint is to compare recurrence-free survival, per BICR assessment. Secondary endpoints include overall survival and time to recurrence (defined as time from randomization to first documented disease recurrence).

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2018","2018","29",,,,"1 Nov 2018","Background: Patients (pts) with advanced HCC have limited treatment (tx) options; the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is the global standard of care. Inhibition of either PD-L1/PD- 1 or VEGF signalling has only limited activity in HCC. However, the additional immunomodulatory effects of bevacizumab (bev; anti-VEGF) may create a favourable tumour microenvironment that can enhance the efficacy of atezolizumab (atezo; anti-PDL1), leading to an effective anti-tumour immune response. Therefore, atezo + bev may have synergistic effects in HCC. Methods: In a Phase Ib study cohort, pts with unresectable or metastatic 1L HCC received atezo 1200 mg + bev 15 mg/kg IV q3w until loss of clinical benefit. The primary endpoints were safety and ORR per investigator (INV) assessment. Secondary endpoints included PFS and DOR per RECIST v1.1, and OS. Results: 43 pts were evaluable for safety as of Jan 11, 2018. Tx-related all-grade (Gr) AEs occurred in 81% of pts; Gr 3-4 AEs were seen in 28%, most commonly hypertension (16%). 3 pts (7%) had tx-related SAEs (autoimmune encephalitis and mental status change in 1 pt, intra-abdominal haemorrhage, jugular vein thrombosis; all Gr 3). No tx-related Gr 5 AEs were seen. Immune-related AEs requiring systemic corticosteroid tx occurred in 5 pts (12%). 23 pts were evaluable for clinical activity. Response rates and 6-month PFS and OS rates are presented in the table. Medians for DOR, PFS and OS have not yet been reached. 12 of 14 responses were ongoing as of the data cutoff (≥ 6 mo in 10 pts). Updated data from an expanded pt cohort will be shown. Conclusions: Atezo + bev had a tolerable safety profile as well as high and durable objective responses. The ORR of 61% suggests that this combination has synergistic activity in HCC.

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2018","2018","29",,,,"1 Nov 2018","Background: Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a disease of high unmet medical need. The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib remains the global 1L standard of care despite considerable toxicities. Single-agent inhibition of PD-L1/PD-1 or VEGF signalling has only modest activity in HCC. However, in a recent Phase Ib study (Lee, ESMO-Asia, 2018, submitted), a response rate of 61% with a manageable safety profile was observed with the combination of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) and bevacizumab (anti-VEGF). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that bevacizumab, when given with atezolizumab, may further enhance atezolizumab's efficacy by reversing VEGF-mediated immunosuppression and promoting T-cell infiltration into the tumour. Clinical benefit with atezolizumab + bevacizumab has also been observed in Phase III studies of patients with 1L renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Trial design: IMbrave150 is a global, multicentre, randomised, open-label, Phase III trial enrolling 1L patients (pts) with locally advanced or metastatic and/or unresectable HCC.

Methods Among 689 patients with cirrhosis and/or chronic hepatitis B who participated to four prospective studies, 42 HCC cases were diagnosed, selected, and matched with 168 controls for age, sex, etiology, cirrhosis, and duration of follow-up in a 1:4 ratio. Levels of AFP, AFP-L3, and DCP at the time of HCC diagnosis, month -6, and month -12 were compared between the cases and controls. Results Of 42 HCC cases, 39 (93%) had cirrhosis, 36 (85.7%) had normal alanine aminotransferase levels, and 31 (73.8%) had very early stage HCC (single <2 cm). AFP and AFP-L3 began to increase from 6 months before diagnosis of HCC in the cases (P<0.05), while they remained unchanged in the controls. At HCC diagnosis, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUROCs) for AFP, AFP-L3, and DCP were 0.77, 0.73, and 0.71, respectively. Combining AFP and AFP-L3 showed higher AUROC (0.83), while adding DCP did not further improve AUROC (0.86). With the optimal cutoff values (AFP, 5 ng/mL and AFP-L3, 4%), sensitivity and specificity of AFP and AFP-L3 combination were 79% and 87%, respectively. Conclusion Among 3 biomarkers, AFP showed the best performance in discriminating HCC cases from controls. AFP and AFP-L3 combination adopting their novel cutoff values (5 ng/mL and 4%, respectively) significantly improved the sensitivity for detecting HCC at very early stage.",,,,L643402581,10.5009/gnl17091

This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) after hepatectomy versus hepatectomy alone in HCC patients with a solitary tumor ≥ 5 cm and MVI. Methods: In this randomized, open-labeled, phase III trial, HCC patients with a solitary tumor ≥ 5 cm and MVI were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 1-2 cycles of adjuvant TACE after hepatectomy (Hepatectomy-TACE) or hepatectomy alone (Hepatectomy Alone). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS); the secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and adverse events. Results: Between June 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012, 250 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the Hepatectomy-TACE group (n = 125) or the Hepatectomy Alone group (n = 125). Clinicopathological characteristics were balanced between the two groups. The median follow-up time from randomization was 37.5 months [interquartile range 18.3-48.2 months]. The median DFS was significantly longer in the Hepatectomy-TACE group than in the Hepatectomy Alone group [17.45 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.99-29.14) vs. 9.27 months (95% CI 6.05-13.70), hazard ratio [HR] = 0.70 (95% CI 0.52-0.95), P = 0.020], respectively. The median OS was also significantly longer in the Hepatectomy-TACE group than in the Hepatectomy Alone group [44.29 months (95% CI 25.99-62.58) vs. 22.37 months (95% CI 10.84-33.91), HR = 0.68 (95% CI 0.48-0.97), P = 0.029]. Treatment-related adverse events were more frequently observed in the Hepatectomy-TACE group, although these were generally mild and manageable. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in both groups were neutropenia and liver dysfunction.

This is due because standard of care treatment options are limited and none of them shows a sufficient efficacy. HCC is an “inflammation-induced cancer” and preliminary preclinical and clinical data suggest that immunotherapeutic approaches may be a good alternative candidate for the treatment of HCC patients improving the dismal prognosis associated with this cancer. However, recent findings strongly suggest that an optimal immunotherapy in HCC requires the combination of an immune activator with immune modulators, aiming at compensating the strong liver immune suppressive microenvironment. One of the most promising strategy could be represented by the combination of a cancer vaccine with immunomodulatory drugs, such as chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors. Very limited examples of such combinatorial strategies have been evaluated in HCC to date, because HCC easily develops resistance to standard chemotherapy, which is also poorly tolerated by patients with liver cirrhosis.

The objective of CLEAR Tranquility (NCT03001076) was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid when added to background lipid-modifying therapy in patients with a history of statin intolerance who require additional LDL-C lowering. Methods: This phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled patients with a history of statin intolerance and an LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL while on stable lipid-modifying therapy. After a 4-week ezetimibe 10 mg/day run-in period, patients were randomized 2:1 to treatment with bempedoic acid 180 mg or placebo once daily added to ezetimibe 10 mg/day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline to week 12 in LDL-C. Results: The study population comprised 269 patients (181 bempedoic acid, 88 placebo). Bempedoic acid added to background lipid-modifying therapy that included ezetimibe reduced LDL-C by 28.5% more than placebo (p < 0.001; −23.5% bempedoic acid, +5.0% placebo). Significant reductions in secondary endpoints, including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (−23.6%), total cholesterol (−18.0%), apolipoprotein B (−19.3%), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (−31.0%), were observed with bempedoic acid vs. placebo (p < 0.001). Bempedoic acid was well tolerated; rates of treatment-emergent adverse events, muscle-related adverse events, and discontinuations were similar in the bempedoic acid and placebo treatment groups.

It is unclear whether adding ribavirin to this treatment regimen increases SVRs in patients with genotype 3 HCV infection and cirrhosis. Methods: We performed a phase 2 trial of 204 patients with genotype 3 HCV infection and compensated cirrhosis (mean age 51 ± 7.4 years) at 29 sites in Spain from August 19, 2016 through April 18, 2017.

Elafibranor (ELA), a PPARα/δ agonist was shown to reverse NASH histology and decrease fibrosis, especially in patients with advanced disease [2], and is currently being evaluated in the RESOLVE-IT phase 3 trial. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ELA on liver carcinoma prevention in rodent NASH models. Methods: The effect of ELA on liver tumor prevention was studied in 3 rodent models. CDAA/c model: Wistar rats on cholesterol-enriched CDAA diet received ELA (10mg/kg/day) for the entire study period of 11 weeks. CD/FF model: C57BL6 mice received during 36 weeks fructose in water and a CDAA diet supplemented with saturated fat and cholesterol. ELA (30mg/kg/day) or placebo were provided from day 1. DENCD/ FF model: C3H mice were injected with DEN at day 14 post partum and received the CD/FF diet for 19 weeks. ELA (10mg/kg/day) or placebo were only administered for the last 8 weeks. A panel of human tumor cell lines was used to evaluate the cytostatic effect of ELA in vitro. Results: Preneoplastic lesions, characterized by GST-P staining, were absent in animals treated with ELA but abundant in placebo-treated animals receiving the CDAA/c diet. Large preneoplastic nodules (n=6-8/liver) were found in livers of mice that received the CD/FF diet. The number of nodules was reduced to an average of 1 upon ELA treatment. Plasma AFP levels and hepatic expression of cancer-associated genes, such as Sox9 and Gpc3, were significantly attenuated by ELA as compared to non-treated mice. Although no histologically-defined hepatocarcinoma developed in the DEN-CD/FF model, numerous lesions, characterized by a total loss of liver architecture, were found in 2 out of 7 DENinjected mice. Such structures were absent in mice that received ELA for the last 8 weeks of the study. Plasma AFP was relatively high (2.8 μg/mL) in DEN-injected CD/FF mice and ELA treatment reduced plasma AFP by 35%. In vitro, ELA showed a direct cytostatic effect in 22 human tumor cell lines with a maximum inhibition effect comprised between 41% and 90%. Conclusion: Preneoplastic lesion development was prevented to a significant extent upon ELA treatment. In addition, ELA directly reduces tumour cell proliferation. These results open new perspectives to evaluate ELA for liver cancer prevention and treatment in NAFLD patients.",,,,L624564337,10.1002/hep.30257

Several studies have reported the clinical benefits of sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC including a placebo-controlled randomized phase III study and a phase III study performed in the Asia-Pacific region . Sorafenib is reported to prolong overall survival by 2.3-2.8 months and the response rate (RR) by 2.0-3.3%, compared with placebo . But, macroscopic vascular invasion (MVI) is poor prognostic facter in sorafenib. HAIC is widely used in Asia, especially in Japan. Several studies have showed the survival benefits of HAIC for advanced HCC without extrahepatic metastasis; with response rate ranging from 20.8 to 52%. The reported median survival time (MST) in complete and partial responders is about 40 and 17 months, respectively. In the majority of retrospective studies, survival was significantly better in responders of HAIC than nonresponders . In HAIC, the response rate sorafenib is usually high and responders have good overall survival. Among several anticancer agents, intra-arterial 5-FU and CDDP were reported as one of the effective combination chemotherapies for HCC with PVTT. Furthermore, the efficacy of combination therapy of HAIC and 3D-CRT for PVTT have been reported. MST of 13.1 months in HCC patients with PVTT treated by HAIC+RT.

There are no studies that compared the benefits of HAIC+RT with sorafenib in HCC patients with major portal vein tumor thrombus. In this retrospective cohort study, we compared the response to HAIC therapy with sorafenib in HCC patients with major portal vein tumor thrombus Child-Pugh ≤7 patients. Methods: In this retrospective study, it included 108 HCC patients with portal vein tumor thrombus of the main trunk or first branch and Child-Pugh ≤7 . They were divided into two groups; 68 received HAIC+RT group and 40 received sorafenib group. Patients are assigned to HAIC+RT group (n=36) and sorafenib group (n=36) through the case-control matching method. The decision to HAIC+RT or sorafenib was left to the attending physician. Results: The median survival time , PFS and PPS were significantly longer in the HAIC+RT group (9.9 , 3.9 , 3.7 months) than sorafenib group (5.3 , 2.1 , 1.9 months, p=0.002, p=0.048, p=0.02, respectively). Multivariate analysis identified HAIC+RT as treatment modality (HR2.02, 95%CI 1.14-3.57, p=0.01) as significant and independent determinants of overall survival.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2018","2018","68",,"387A","388A","1 Oct 2018","Background: The reported annual incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection ranges from 1%-3% overall (Morgan RL et al Ann Intern Med. 2013;158:329-337) compared with 1% in those achieving SVR (Baumert TF, et al. BMC Med. 2017;15:52). Recent data have caused controversy regarding the association between direct-acting antiviral therapy for HCV and HCC. The risk of HCC following treatment with a grazoprevir (GZR)-containing regimen has not been previously evaluated. Methods: An analysis of participants enrolled in the on-going GZR phase 2/3 long-term observational follow-up study (Protocol PN017, NCT01667081) was conducted to identify incident cases of HCC. Annual visits in the follow-up study included durability of virologic response, characterization of virologic failure, and a focused assessment of liver disease progression. Liver assessments included laboratory evaluations and medical history reviews to identify incident HCC, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and variceal bleeding. Results: Of the 2435 participants enrolled in the follow-up study, 1952 received elbasvir (EBR)/GZR ± ribavirin (RBV), 235 received GZR plus peginterferon/ RBV, 149 received GZR plus uprifosbuvir and either EBR or ruzasvir, 72 received EBR/GZR plus sofosbuvir, and 27 received GZR plus RBV. Approximately 58% of participants were male, 75% were white, and median age was 53 years (range, 18-82 years). No participants developed HCC during treatment. Among 2435 participants who were followed for up to 4 years from the end of treatment, 15 developed incident HCC (15/2435, 0.6%), 13 of whom had previously achieved sustained virologic remission (13/2330; 0.6%). Eleven were cirrhotic (11/677, 1.6%) and 4 were noncirrhotic (4/1756, 0.2%). Four of 15 participants died because of HCC and 1 died because of an unknown cause. Two of 15 participants developed HCC following HCV virologic relapse. The median time to onset of HCC was 448 days (IQR, 204-600), and overall time at risk was 5422.7 person-years (PY), yielding an HCC incidence rate of 2.77 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 1.55-4.56) (Table). Conclusion: Among 2435 participants who were followed for up to 4 years from the end of treatment with GZR, 15 developed incident HCC (0.6%). The use of GZRcontaining regimens does not increase the risk of de novo HCC occurrence. Data are forthcoming regarding the potential for these regimens to decrease the risk of HCC following SVR.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2018","2018","68",,"553A","554A","1 Oct 2018","Background: Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may require repeated invasive procedures such as ablation and embolization. Thrombocytopenia complicates management of chronic liver disease (CLD), and may interfere with the performance of invasive procedures. Lusutrombopag (LUSU) is an oral, small molecule thrombopoietin receptor agonist for improvement of thrombocytopenia associated with CLD in patients undergoing invasive procedures. Here we assess the efficacy and safety of LUSU in patients with HCC in comparison to those with other CLD diagnoses without HCC. Methods: L-PLUS 1 and L-PLUS 2 were two similar Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies; L-PLUS 1 was conducted in Japan and L-PLUS 2 in the rest of the world. Patients with CLD received LUSU 3 mg once daily or placebo (PBO) for up to 7 days prior to an invasive procedure scheduled 9-14 days after randomization. Patients were adults with platelet counts (PC) <50 x 109/L at baseline. Platelet transfusion (PT) was mandated if the PC remained <50 x 109/L prior to procedure. The efficacy endpoint for this pooled analysis based on the per protocol population was the proportion of patients who required no PT prior to the invasive procedure and no rescue therapy for bleeding from randomization through 7 days after the invasive procedure. Results: 312 patients were randomized. Of the 270 patients in the per protocol population, 95 were with HCC and 175 without. For subjects with HCC, the mean age was 65.6 years, 61.1% were male, and 88.4% of the planned invasive procedures were liver-related. 68.0% of patients with HCC who received LUSU met the efficacy endpoint vs 8.9% of patients who received PBO (delta treatment effect of 59.1%). This compared to 77.0% and 21.6%, respectively, among patients with other CLD diagnoses (delta treatment effect of 55.4%) (Figure). In patients with HCC, PCs remained above 50 x 109/L for a median of 16.6 days in the LUSU group, compared to 3.8 days for PBO. One patient treated with LUSU experienced treatment-emergent portal vein thrombosis, but never reached a PC >200 x 109/L. Conclusion: LUSU was superior to PBO as treatment for managing thrombocytopenia in patients with HCC undergoing planned invasive procedures. The efficacy of LUSU in patients with HCC was similar to that of patients with other CLD diagnoses.",,,,L624564803,10.1002/hep.30257

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2018","2018","68",,"166A",,"1 Oct 2018","Background: Ramucirumab (RAM), a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody, inhibits activation of VEGFR2. REACH-2 and REACH were two randomized, global, blinded, phase 3 studies of RAM vs palcebo (PL) in patients (pts) with HCC after prior sorafenib. REACH-2 was designed to confirmed the benefit of RAM in the pre-specified population of pts with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL observed in REACH. The primary endpoint of REACH-2 was met demonstrating an improved overall survival (OS), and RAM was well tolerated. Pooled analyses of pts from REACH-2 (292) and REACH (250) with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL were performed (N=316 RAM vs N=226 PL) Methods: With the exception of AFP level, REACH-2 and REACH eligibility were similar, enrolling HCC pts with BCLC stage C or B refractory/not amenable to locoregional therapy, ECOG PS 0 or 1, Child-Pugh <7; disease progression on or intolerance to sorafenib, and adequate lab parameters. Pts received IV RAM (8 mg/kg) or PL every 14 days and were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Pooled analyses were performed at the individual pt level, stratified by study, and assessed OS, progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), safety, and pt reported symptoms (FACT-Hepatobiliary Symptom Index-8 [FSHI-8]). Results: Pooled baseline pt characteristics were balanced between arms including ECOG PS, presence of macrovascular invasion, and baseline AFP. RAM treatment significantly improved OS (median OS 8.1 mo vs 5.0 mo PL; HR 0.694; 95% CI 0.571, 0.842; p=.0002). Improvements were observed in PFS (median PFS 2.8 mo vs 1.5 mo PL; HR 0.572; 95% CI 0.472, 0.694; p<.0001), ORR (5.4% RAM vs 0.9% PL [p=.0040]), and disease control rate (ORR + stable disease = 56.3% RAM vs 37.2% PL [p<.0001]). Dose intensity was 98.3% RAM vs 99.6% PL. 9.5% of pts on the RAM arm vs 3.6% on PL discontinued study treatment due to treatment-related adverse events (AEs). Hypertension (12.0% vs 3.6% PL) and hyponatremia (5.1% vs 2.2% PL) were the only Grade (G) ≥3 treatment-emergent AEs occurring in ≥5% in RAM. RAM treatment significantly delayed time to deterioration of FHSI-8 (p=0.0152), including individual items of back pain, weight loss, and pain. Conclusion: A pooled analysis of two phase 3 trials assessing RAM as second-line treatment in pts with HCC following first-line sorafenib and AFP ≥400 ng/mL (REACH-2 and REACH) demonstrates a significant and clinically meaningful benefit with a favorable safety profile, including a benefit in pt-reported outcomes.",,,,L624564910,10.1002/hep.30256

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2018","2018","68",,"358A",,"1 Oct 2018","Background: Sustained virologic response (SVR) is associated with reduced rates of liver disease progression, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and mortality in patients with HCV infection. Glecaprevir (identified by AbbVie and Enanta) coformulated with pibrentasvir (G/P) achieved 98% overall SVR12 in Phase 2 and 3 studies. This study evaluates 1) the durability of SVR in patients who achieved SVR12 with G/P to assess post-SVR12 relapse, 2) the emergence and persistence of resistance-associated amino acid substitutions (RAS) in those who did not achieve SVR12, and 3) the occurrence of liver-related safety events. Methods: This is an ongoing phase 2/3, multicenter, noninterventional study conducted in adults with chronic HCV GT1-6 infection who received at least one dose of G/P with or without ribavirin (RBV) and who completed the post-treatment period in an AbbVie phase 2 or 3 clinical study. Patients are being followed for 3 years following their last dose of study drug. The primary efficacy endpoints were conducted in the full analysis set, which included patients who achieved SVR12 in a prior AbbVie study, and were 1) the percentage of patients who maintained viral suppression (HCV RNA below the lower limit of quantification) and 2) the percentage of patients who relapsed or had new HCV infections after achieving SVR12. Liver disease progression and the persistence of RASs were also assessed. Results: The full analysis set includes 377 patients; Table 1 shows baseline demographics. To date, the median follow-up period for the full analysis set was 626 days; 57/377 (15%) have completed the 3-year follow-up. In total, 99.5% of patients maintained viral suppression; 2 patients did not: one GT3-infected patient who reported injection drug use was found to be reinfected with GT1a at PTW24, the second patient relapsed post-SVR24 and prior to completing the initial study visit (the patient subsequently withdrew consent and no further data are available). Regarding liver disease progression, 1/377 patients had an AE of HCC that occurred after achieving SVR12, and 1/377 patients had an AE of a regenerated liver node that occurred after achieving SVR24, more than one year prior to starting this study. Conclusion: In this long-term follow-up study, 99.5% patients with chronic HCV infection who achieved SVR12 with G/P with or without RBV maintained SVR, including all 90 patients who were treated with the 8-week G/P regimen. Adverse events related to liver disease progression were rare (<1%). Updated data, including viral resistance, will be presented. (Table Presented).",,,,L624564925,10.1002/hep.30257

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2018","2018","68",,"169A",,"1 Oct 2018","Background: TTP and RR have been suggested as potential surrogate endpoints for OS in advanced HCC. We have previously reported a weak correlation between OS and TTP/ RR in the phase 3 sorafenib SHARP and Asia-Pacific trials. We assessed whether there was a correlation between OS and TTP/RR using simulated trials based on patient-level data from the phase 3 RESORCE trial in patients with advanced HCC randomized to regorafenib (REG) or placebo (PBO). Methods: A bootstrap approach was applied to simulate 10,000 trials of patients with advanced HCC from RESORCE (N=573; NCT01774344). TTP and RR were assessed by investigators using RECIST 1.1. Pearson correlation was calculated between estimated median OS (mOS) and estimated median TTP (mTTP)/estimated RR for the REG and PBO arms separately. Pearson correlation of log-rank test statistics comparing REG and PBO were calculated for OS and TTP; Pearson correlation of log-rank test statistics comparing 2 arms for OS and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test statistic comparing the 2 arms for RR was also evaluated. Results: The mean of mOS, mTTP, and RR from the simulated trial was similar to that reported in RESORCE (Table). The correlation between mOS and mTTP was 0.406 for REG and 0.167 for PBO; the correlation of log-rank test statistics comparing REG and PBO was 0.485. The correlation between mOS and RR was 0.131 for REG and 0.181 for PBO; the correlation of mOS and RR using test statistics comparing REG and PBO was 0.246. Conclusion: The simulated data were representative of patient population data in the RESORCE trial for mOS, mTTP, and RR. Our analysis showed only a weak correlation between OS and TTP/RR, consistent with previous results from SHARP/AP that TTP and RR by RECIST 1.1 are not reliable surrogate endpoints for OS in patient with advanced HCC.

C, an inhibitor of MET, VEGF receptors, and AXL, improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with P in the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial (NCT01908426). Median OS was 10.2 mo with C vs 8.0 mo with P (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.92; p=0.0049), and median PFS was 5.2 mo with C vs 1.9 mo with P (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.36-0.52; p<0.0001) (Abou-Alfa, JCO 2018, ASCO GI abstract 207). Methods: 707 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive C (60 mg qd) or P. Eligible patients had pathologic diagnosis of HCC, Child-Pugh score A, and ECOG performance status ≤1. Patients must have received prior sorafenib and 1-2 prior lines of systemic therapy for HCC and must have progressed following at least one. Stratification was by disease etiology, geographic region, and extent of disease. Outcomes were analyzed by baseline AFP levels using cutoffs of 20, 200, and 400 ng/mL. Results: Overall, 69% of patients had baseline AFP ≥20 ng/mL, 49% had AFP ≥200 ng/mL, and 41% had AFP ≥400 ng/mL. For patients with baseline AFP <400 ng/mL, median OS was 13.9 mo with C vs 10.3 mo with P (HR 0.81), and median PFS was 5.5 mo with C vs 1.9 mo with P (HR 0.47). For patients with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL, median OS was 8.5 mo with C vs 5.2 mo with P (HR 0.71), and median PFS was 3.9 mo with C vs 1.9 mo with P (HR 0.42). C also improved OS vs P in patients with AFP ≥200 ng/mL or ≥20 ng/ mL, and C improved PFS irrespective of AFP levels (Table). Patients with high baseline AFP experienced high-grade transaminitis more frequently in both treatment groups; grade 3/4 elevated aspartate aminotransferase with C vs P was 8% vs 4% for AFP <400 ng/mL and 17% vs 11% for AFP ≥400 ng/ mL. Conclusion: C improved OS and PFS vs P in patients with previously treated advanced HCC across a range of baseline AFP levels. High AFP levels were associated with a larger treatment benefit with C for both OS and PFS. (Table Presented).",,,,L624565137,10.1002/hep.30257

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2018","2018","68",,"899A",,"1 Oct 2018","Background: Among patients with hepatitis C (HCV), HIV co-infection confers greater risk for hepatic decompensation. Liver-related death is the leading cause of non-AIDs related mortality. Direct-acting antiviral regimens (DAA) for HCV have demonstrated sustained viral response rates above 90%. The impact of HCV clearance on risk of mortality in HIVHCV co-infected patients is not known. The AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) is a validated predictor of liver fibrosis and mortality risk. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of DAA treatment on indices of liver disease severity and risk of mortality in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Methods: We compiled data from four phase 3 prospective open label clinical trials of HCV therapy in patients with HIV-HCV co-infection. Treatment regimens included sofosbuvir with either ribavirin, velpatasvir, or ledipasvir. Patients with hepatitis B, current or prior history of hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. Data was collected at baseline and 4, 12, 24, and 28 weeks from treatment initiation. Results: Of the 162 patients analysed, sustained viral response was achieved in 91% (148/162) at 12 weeks. The mean APRI was 1.61 at baseline and improved to 0.59 at final follow-up (p<0.001). Of patients with a baseline APRI above 1.5, 78% were below at final follow-up. Mean platelet count, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and albumin also significantly improved (P<0.05). Two deaths and zero liver transplants were observed. Based on prior large prospective studies correlating APRI with mortality, the observed baseline APRI mean would have an estimated five year all-cause mortality of 23% versus 12% at followup. The baseline APRI above 1.5 is also associated with a hazard ratio of 10.18 for liver-related mortality. Conclusion: This is the first study to examine the effect of DAA therapy on biomarkers of severity of liver fibrosis in HIV-HCV coinfected patients. We observed a substantial and statistically significant improvement in mean APRI from a baseline level above to a level well below the validated threshold of 1.5 for significant hepatic fibrosis and greater mortality risk. DAA therapy was also associated with improvement in several additional indices of liver disease severity. The observed improvement in APRI portends a probable reduction in the risk of liver-related and all-cause mortality in patients with HIV-HCV co-infection treated with DAA.",,,,L624565972,10.1002/hep.30257

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2018","2018","24","10 A","S22",,"1 Oct 2018","BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma is an aggressive cancer whose treatment options are divided into surgical and nonsurgical therapies, including systemic chemotherapy. Lenvatinib, a targeted systemic chemotherapy, is being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval for use in 1st line treatment of unresectable HCC (uHCC). Only sorafenib, another targeted systemic chemotherapy, is approved for 1st line treatment of uHCC. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the hypothetical one-year budget impact of using lenvatinib versus sorafenib in the treatment of uHCC from a payer perspective. METHODS: The model assessed a hypothetical 1-million member health plan. The patient population consisted of adults with uHCC initiating 1st line chemotherapy. Treatment outcomes, including treatment duration and progression-free survival, and adverse event rates were based on the REFLECT trial, an open-label Phase III randomized clinical trial of lenvatinib (12 mg QD for body weight ≥ 60 kg, 8 mg QD for body weight < 60 kg) versus sorafenib (400 mg BID). Other model inputs included market share of 1st and 2nd line HCC chemotherapies, drug acquisition and administration costs, best supportive care costs, and other direct medical costs. Second line treatment options included lenvatinib, sorafenib, nivolumab, regorafenib and best supportive care. Model outputs consisted of annual treatments cost by chemotherapy in the base year (without use of lenvatinib) and comparator year (lenvatinib available and used by 58% of 1st line patients), and per member per month cost (PMPM) differences. The impact of parameter uncertainty was assessed in one-way sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The model estimated 21 patients (0.002%) would initiate treatment on 1st line chemotherapy for uHCC in a hypothetical 1-million member health plan. Wholesale acquisition costs per treatment cycle were estimated to be $15,970 for lenvatinib and $17,303 for sorafenib. The model projected total annual uHCC treatment costs for the health plan would decrease from $4.04 million at baseline to $3.92 million in the comparator year resulting in a PMPM cost savings of $0.01. Model results were most sensitive to changes in acquisition costs of lenvatinib and sorafenib, and the cost of best supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: Only a small proportion of patients initiate systemic treatment for uHCC annually. The results of this model suggest that use of lenvatinib versus sorafenib may potentially decrease costs to the health plan while extending progression-free survival.",,,,L624641016,10.18553/jmcp.2018.24.10-a.s1

An open-label phase 3 clinical trial in Japan showed that an SVR was achieved by 100% of patients. However, in the real world, some patients experience virologic failure. Aims and Methods: We aimed to reveal the factors associated with virologic failure in patients treated with SOF/LDV, and to identify the baseline NS5A and NS5B resistance-associated substitutions (RASs). Four hundred ninety-three patients with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1b infection were treated with SOF/LDV; 31 had a history of interferon (IFN)-free treatment with daclatasvir and asunaprevir. The effect of baseline RASs on the response to SOF/LDV therapy was analyzed. We investigated the viral genome sequence by direct sequencing. Results: The age of the patients ranged from 26 to 90 years (mean, 68 years). There were 295 female patients (60%) and 105 (21%) patients with cirrhosis. Sixty-three patients (13%) had previously been treated for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overall, a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12) was achieved in 476 patients (96.6%). The SVR12 rates in the patients with IFN-free treatment-naïve and retreatment were 97.6% and 80.6%, respectively. HCV eradication was not achieved in 17 patients, 11 (including 5 with IFN-free retreatment) of whom had virologic failure. Eight patients had coexisting NS5A RASs of Q24, L28 and/or R30, L31, or Y93 and one patient had coexisting NS5A RASs of P32L and A92K. Interestingly, 10 and 8 patients had NS5B A218S and C316N RAS respectively. No patients had NS5B L159, S282, L320 or V321 RASs at the baseline. In particular, the patients who had NS5B C316 RAS also had coexisting A218 RAS. In addition, no patients acquired these RASs. According to a multivariate analysis, coexisting NS5A RASs, NS5A P32 RAS, NS5B A218 and/or C316 RASs, and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase were associated with virologic failure. In the naïve patients, all patients without NS5B A218 and/or C316 RAS achieved an SVR12. Notably, the SVR12 rates of patients with coexisting NS5A and NS5B RASs were significantly lower (83.3%). Conclusion: Although SOF/LDV therapy resulted in a high SVR12 rate, coexisting NS5A and NS5B RASs were associated with virologic failure. These results might indicate that the coexisting baseline RASs influence the therapeutic effects of SOF/LDV.",,,,L625968197,10.1177/2050640618792819

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2018","2018","29",,"VII10",,"1 Oct 2018","Advanced liver cancer is a challenging disease to manage. We have learned several important lessons over the past several years. First, staging is important and consideration needs to be given to both a patients underlying liver disease and tumor characteristics. Next, systemic chemotherapy has not been proven to improve outcomes in this disease. The first systemic treatment to do so was the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib. Since that time, there have been numerous phase 3 failures in both the front-line and second line. The reasons for this are multiple but include a lack of insight into patient selection, over interpretation of single-arm phase 2 studies, and a lack of appreciation of toxicities in a cirrhotic population. In the past 2 years however, there has been a dramatic change in the results of trials with new drugs in HCC. For the first time we had a positive study with lenvatinib vs sorafenib in the front-line setting. In the second-line setting we have seen two positive phase 3 studies with both regorafenib and cabozantinb versus placebo and just recently, a press release informing us that ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody to the VEGF receptor, improves survival versus placebo in patients with advanced HCC after progression on sorafenib and a baseline AFP of greater than or equal to 400 ng/ml. Together, these results are bringing new options for patients after a decade of only one drug available. The next question will be how to we apply these data to practice, how do we sequence these active drugs and ultimately, what are the next set-of studies to continue to move things ahead. These data and concepts will be reviewed in the presentation.",,,,L628294763,10.1093/annonc/mdy349

In addition to its anti-angiogenic activity, bevacizumab (bev; anti-VEGF) has immunomodulatory effects that alter the tumour microenvironment, which may augment atezolizumab (atezo; anti-PD-L1)-mediated antitumour immune responses. This scientific rationale, including preclinical and clinical data, supports the hypothesis that the combination of atezo + bev may be effective in advanced HCC. Methods: In a Phase Ib study cohort, patients (pts) with unresectable or metastatic HCC received atezo 1200 mg + bev 15 mg/kg IV q3w as first-line (1L) tx until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objectives were safety and efficacy based on investigator-assessed ORR per RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included PFS and DOR per RECIST v1.1. Results: As of Mar 23, 2018, 68 pts were safety evaluable. Any grade (Gr) tx-related AEs occurred in 49 pts (72%). Gr 3-4 tx-related AEs were seen in 17 pts (25%), most commonly hypertension (n=8 [12%]). 5 pts (7%) experienced Gr 3 tx-related serious AEs. No tx-related Gr 5 AEs occurred. Immune-related AEs requiring systemic corticosteroid tx occurred in 4 pts (6%). As of Jul 26, 2018, 68 pts were efficacy evaluable (follow-up ≥18 wk). The ORR was 34%. Responses were observed in all clinically relevant subgroups, including pts with AFP ≥400 ng/ml, EHS and/or MVI (Table). 19 of 23 confirmed responses were ongoing (≥6mo in 11 pts). The 6-mo PFS rate was 71%. Median DOR and median OS have not yet been reached (DOR range, 1.6+ to 22.0+). Updated data (including IRF-assessed ORR and PFS per RECIST v1.1 and HCC mRECIST) will be presented. Conclusions: With a tolerable safety profile, encouraging response rates and durable responses, atezo + bev may be a promising 1L tx option for pts with advanced HCC.

REACH-2 met its primary endpoint demonstrating an improved overall survival (OS) for RAM treatment compared to PL, consistent with the benefit observed in pre-specified patients with AFP ≥400 ng/mL in REACH. Patient reported outcome (PRO) analyses of disease-related symptoms in patients from REACH-2, and pooled with patients from REACH with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/ mL were performed. Methods: Eligible patients had advanced HCC, Child-Pugh A, ECOG PS 0 or 1, AFP ≥400 ng/mL, and prior sorafenib. Patients received RAM 8 mg/kg or PL Q2W. PROs were assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Hepatobiliary Symptom Index (FHSI)-8 at baseline, Q6W and end of treatment. Deterioration in FHSI-8 was defined as≥3-point decrease in total score, or a decrease in one categorical response for an individual item. Time to deterioration (TTD) was time from the date of randomization to the first date of deterioration. Results: Analysis populations included REACH-2, REACH AFP ≥400 ng/mL, and the two populations pooled. FHSI-8 compliance was acceptable. Similar to REACH patients with AFP ≥400 ng/mL, RAM patients in REACH-2 reported a positive trend in TTD in FHSI-8 total score compared to PL. A similar trend was observed in most individual items, including a significant delay in back pain progression. In the pooled population, RAM treatment significantly delayed total FHSI-8 TTD, including the back pain, weight loss, and pain items, relative to PL.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2018","2018","29",,"viii264","viii265","1 Oct 2018","Background: Unresectable HCC accounts for 70% of diagnosed HCC. Tislelizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody with high affinity and specificity for programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1). Tislelizumab was specifically engineered to minimize Fc!R binding on macrophages that, based on preclinical evidence, is believed to minimize potentially negative interactions with other immune cells. A phase 1A/1B study (NCT02407990) demonstrated that single-agent tislelizumab was generally well tolerated and showed preliminary evidence of antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors, including HCC. A recommended phase 3 dose of 200 mg administered intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) has been established for tislelizumab. Trial design: This global, phase 3, randomized, multicenter study (NCT03412773) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab compared with sorafenib as a potential first-line treatment of unresectable HCC. Adult patients, aged ≥ 18 years, with unresectable, histologically confirmed HCC, an ECOG score ≥ 1, Child-Pugh A classification, BCLC Stage C disease or BCLC Stage B disease that has relapsed after loco-regional therapy, and who have not received prior systemic therapy, are being enrolled. Approximately 640 patients from 100 international centers are planned to be randomized (1:1) to receive tislelizumab 200 mg IV Q3W or sorafenib 400 mg orally BID. The primary outcome of this study is overall survival (OS) of patients treated with tislelizumab compared with OS of patients treated with sorafenib; secondary outcomes include objective response rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, time to progression, and quality-of-life outcomes. Safety/tolerability assessments include monitoring adverse events (AEs), including immune-related AEs, as well as physical examinations, vital signs, and electrocardiograms. Exploratory endpoints include assessment of potential biomarkers, characterization of the tislelizumab pharmacokinetic profile in patients with HCC, and assessment of host immunogenicity to tislelizumab.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2018","2018","29",,"viii267",,"1 Oct 2018","Background: Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a disease of high unmet medical need. Despite considerable toxicities, sorafenib (sor) is the 1L standard of care. Single-agent inhibition of PD-L1/PD-1 or VEGF signalling has only modest activity in HCC, but in a Phase Ib study of atezolizumab (atezo; anti-PD-L1)+ bevacizumab (bev; anti-VEGF) combination, a response rate of 61% with a manageable safety profile (Pishvaian ESMO 2018, submitted) is observed. Clinical benefit with atezo + bev was also seen in 1L renal cell carcinoma and 1L non-small cell lung cancer (Motzer ASCO GU 2018, Reck ESMO IO 2017). The potential synergy between atezo and bev may stem from bev's additional immunomodulatory effects in the tumour microenvironment (increased DC maturation, enhanced T-cell infiltration, reduced MDSCs and Tregs in tumours) that may potentiate the efficacy of atezo in re-invigorating the antitumour T-cell response.

J Hepatol 2018), and therefore, adjuvant therapies are needed. Nivolumab (NIVO) has demonstrated durable tumor responses and a manageable safety profile in patients (pts) with advanced HCC, regardless of HCC etiology (CheckMate-040 study) (El-Khoueiry, et al.

This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjuvant NIVO in pts with HCC who are at high risk of recurrence after curative hepatic resection or ablation, a population for whom no effective therapies are currently available. Trial design: The trial will include 530 pts aged ≥ 18 y with a first diagnosis of HCC (any etiology) who are at high risk for HCC recurrence after curative resection or ablation, and who have well-preserved liver function (Child-Pugh score 5 or 6), randomized (1:1) to receive NIVO (480 mg intravenous Q4W) or placebo (PBO). Additional eligibility criteria include Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, no evidence of tumor metastasis, no prior therapy for HCC (including locoregional therapies), and no liver transplant. Pts will be treated until recurrence per blinded independent central review (BICR) assessment, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal, or for up to 1 y total duration.

This exploratory analysis evaluated the impact of SNPs on regorafenib treatment benefit (OS and TTP) and the occurrence of hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) in the RESORCE trial. Methods: Genotyping of 187 SNPs was performed on whole blood DNA from 330/573 (58%) patients from RESORCE using a custom NimbleGenTM kit and sequencing libraries that were made using NimbleGenTM KAPA Hyper construction kits. The prognostic and predictive effects of the SNPs, as well as the impact on the occurrence of grade ≥ 1 HFSR, were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression with Breslow tie handling or logistic regression, respectively. Models were adjusted for clinical covariates as determined by Akaike information criterion (AIC)-based selection and adjusted for population stratification. P values were corrected for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction and deemed significant at an adjusted a ≥ 0.05. Results: The overall RESORCE and biomarker cohorts were generally similar for demographic variables (except the latter had a smaller proportion of Asian patients) and outcomes. None of the assessed SNPs were prognostic or predictive of OS. In contrast, 6 SNPs (positioned in the UGT1A1, VEGFC, and TIE2 genes) were prognostic for TTP; SNP rs4148323 in the UGT1A1 gene was predictive for TTP (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.12- 0.49; adjusted p=0.012). The rs1547651 SNP in the VEGFA gene showed a significant prognostic effect on the occurrence of grade ≥ 1 HFSR (odds ratio [OR] 0.04, 95% CI 0.01-0.19; adjusted p=0.037), while the rs114681547 SNP, also in the VEGFA gene, showed a predictive effect (OR 26.23, 95% CI 5.39-197.96; adjusted p=0.038).

Median OS was 10.2 mo for C vs 8.0mo for P (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.92; p=0.0049), and median PFS was 5.2 mo for C vs 1.9 mo for P (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.36- 0.52; p<0.0001) (Abou-Alfa, JCO 2018). Here, outcomes were analyzed for pts who received prior TACE. Methods: 707 pts were randomized 2:1 to receive C (60 mg qd) or P stratified by disease etiology, geographic region, and extent of disease. Eligible pts had pathologic diagnosis of HCC, Child-Pugh score A, and ECOG PS≤1. Pts must have received prior sorafenib and could have received up to two lines of prior systemic therapy for HCC. Outcomes were analyzed by number of prior TACE treatments (0,≥1, 1-2, ≥3). Results: Overall, 203 (43%) pts in the C arm and 111 (47%) pts in the P arm had received prior TACE with a median of 2 and 3 treatments, respectively. For pts who received TACE, 54% received 1-2 treatments and 46% received ≥3. 61% of pts enrolled in Asia, 39% in Europe, and 37% in North America received prior TACE. For pts who received prior TACE vs no TACE, 67% vs 76% received 1 prior systemic regimen and 32%vs 23%received 2. C was associated with improvedOS and PFS vs P irrespective of prior TACE treatment (Table).Median OS was 11.4mo for C vs 8.6mo for P in pts with prior TACE and 9.5mo for C vs 7.2mo for P in pts with no prior TACE.

In a phase 3 randomized, open-label, first-line study in pts with uHCC, LEN demonstrated a treatment effect on overall survival (OS) by statistical confirmation of noninferiority to SOR, with an improved objective response rate.(Kudo et al. Lancet 2018) Preliminary biomarker analyses (n=114) have been presented.(Finn et al. ESMO 2017) We now present the final biomarker analyses and correlations with efficacy for all pts with serum samples (n=407). Methods: 954 Pts with uHCC were randomized 1:1 to LEN (≥ 60 kg: 12 mg/day; < 60 kg: 8 mg/day) or SOR 400 mg BID. Serum samples were collected (LEN, n=279; SOR, n=128) at baseline and during the study; VEGF, ANG2, FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23 were assayed by ELISA. Correlations with tumor response (by independent imaging review per mRECIST: complete or partial responses [CR/PR] vs others) were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank-sumtests. Baseline biomarker levels were analyzed by quartiles: low (0-25%), middle (25-75%), or high (75-100%). Correlations with OS were examined by Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier plots, and log-rank tests. All P-values are nominal. Results: Both treatments increased VEGF levels, but only LEN increased FGF19 and FGF23 levels. In the LEN arm, pts with CR/PR had a greater increase in FGF19 and FGF23 from baseline vs nonresponders (FGF19: 55.2% vs 18.3%, P=0.0140; FGF23: 48.4% vs 16.4%; P=0.0022). Higher VEGF, ANG2, and FGF21 baseline levels were associated with worse OS in both arms. However, for pts with high baseline FGF21 (LEN, n=70; SOR, n=27), OS was longer for LEN vs SOR (median, 10.9 vs 6.8 months; HR, 0.528; 95% CI, 0.328-0.849; P=0.0075), and correlations with OS and treatments were observed between high and low-middle groups (Pinteraction=0.0397). Conclusions: Differences in biomarker changes between treatments may reflect distinct target engagements for LEN and SOR. Increased baseline VEGF, ANG2, and FGF21 may be prognostic for shorter OS with both treatments, and increased FGF21 may be predictive for reduced OS with SOR. These results are hypothesis-generating and warrant further study.",,,,L628562644,10.1093/annonc/mdy269.057

However, there is substantial heterogeneity in reporting of patient characteristics and use of stratification factors in phase 3 trials investigating systemic treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We aimed to develop a minimum set of essential baseline characteristics and stratification factors to include in such trials. Methods: We performed a modified, two-round Delphi survey among international experts with wide experience in the conduct and methodology of phase 3 trials of systemic treatment of mCRC. Results: Thirty mCRC experts from 15 different countries completed both consensus rounds. A total of 14 patient characteristics were included in the recommended set: age, performance status, primary tumour location, primary tumour resection, prior chemotherapy, number of metastatic sites, liver-only disease, liver involvement, surgical resection of metastases, synchronous versus metachronous metastases, (K)RAS and BRAF mutation status, microsatellite instability/mismatch repair status and number of prior treatment lines. A total of five patient characteristics were considered the most relevant stratification factors: RAS/BRAF mutation status, performance status, primary tumour sidedness and liver-only disease. Conclusions: This survey provides a minimum set of essential baseline patient characteristics and stratification factors to include in phase 3 trials of systemic treatment of mCRC.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2018","2018","21",,"S15",,"1 Sep 2018","Objectives: The purpose of this study was to develop an economic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of proton beam therapy (PBT) for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization (TACE). Methods: Partitioned survival model was developed to predict costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in PBT and TACE arm. Direct medical costs were considered from the Japanese payer's perspective. Time horizon and cycle length of the model was set to 10 years and 1 month, respectively. An annual discount rate of 2% for both costs and QALYs was applied. Data on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was derived from the interim analysis of phase III randomized controlled trial comparing PBT and TACE in patients with HCC. Cost parameters were estimated by using the JMDC claims database. Utilities were derived from published sources other than Japan. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of PBT compared with TACE was estimated. Deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess uncertainty in parameter settings. Results: Compared with TACE, PBT incurred an additional cost of JPY 848,126 and conferred an additional 0.1053 QALY. This resulted in the ICER of JPY 8,047,060 per QALY gained. Several settings such as utilities, costs and survival functions strongly affected the base case result. Conclusions: Applying the willingness to pay threshold of JPY 6,000,000 per QALY, PBT might not be cost-effective compared with TACE in HCC. However, there is uncertainty surrounding the model inputs such as OS, PFS, utilities, and costs. Further research is required on survival benefit, utilities, medical costs of Japanese patients with HCC.",,,,L2001249045,10.1016/j.jval.2018.07.114

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2018","2018","24","9","711","718","1 Sep 2018","Background: Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) rank among the most common cancers worldwide, with a rising incidence in Western countries. HCCs are characterized by a pronounced chemoresistance. Materials and methods: The work is based on a selective literature review that reflects the current clinical context and promising future developments. Results: The tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib is the current standard treatment for advanced HCCs in patients with preserved liver function. After the approval of sorafenib in 2007, none of the substances tested in large phase III studies until 2016 showed a survival benefit in first- and second-line treatment. In 2016, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor regorafenib showed a meaningful improvement in overall survival after failure of sorafenib therapy and thus extended the spectrum of active substances in a second-line setting. In addition, the non-inferiority of lenvatinib in comparison to sorafenib opened another therapeutic first-line option. Positive results with cabozantinib and ramucirumab as second-line treatment have recently been presented. The checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab have proven promising and initiated the era of immune oncology in HCC, which will probably gain increasing importance for mono- as well as combination therapy. Conclusion: After nearly 10 years of stagnation in the field of systemic treatment, several active substances are now available for the treatment of HCC. Thus, for the first time, a sequential approach is both possible and feasible, which will ultimately improve the survival of HCC patients.",,20180482502,,L622950923,10.1007/s00761-018-0404-1

Since then many drugs failed in the first- and second-line setting and it took almost another decade until further tyrosine kinase inhibitors succeeded in phase III trials. Aim: To summarise the evolving field of systemic therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: We reviewed recently published studies identified from PubMed and data presented at recent meetings. Main search terms included hepatocellular carcinoma, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, sorafenib, regorafenib, lenvatinib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab, and nivolumab. Results: We discuss the evolution of targeted therapies since the approval of sorafenib including failures and recent advances. We also elaborate the unmet need of biomarkers to guide treatment decisions and discuss the emerging field of immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusions: The tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib (first line) and regorafenib (second line) have been approved for hepatocellular carcinoma, and the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab obtained conditional approval for sorafenib-experienced patients in the United States. With lenvatinib in the first line, and cabozantinib and ramucirumab in sorafenib-experienced patients, three more targeted therapies reached their primary endpoint in phase III trials and may soon be added to the treatment armamentarium.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01405573, NCT01658878, NCT02325739, NCT02421185, NCT02423343, NCT02576509, NCT02702401, NCT02837029, NCT02988440, NCT03006926, NCT03033446, NCT03062358, NCT03143270, NCT03298451, NCT03347292, NCT03383458, NCT03434379)",,30039640,L623244376,10.1111/apt.14913

Pembrolizumab (PEM) is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody that has shown promising activity in HCC. An ongoing Phase 1b study of LEN + PEM has shown promising activity in several solid tumor types. We report preliminary results from a Phase 1b trial of LEN + PEM in patients with uHCC. Methods: In this open-label, multicenter study, patients with uHCC, BCLC stage B (not eligible for transarterial chemoembolization) or C, Child-Pugh class A, and ECOG PS <1 received LEN (body weight >60 kg: 12 mg/day; <60 kg: 8 mg/day) daily and 200 mg intravenous PEM once every 3 weeks. Tolerability was evaluated by assessing dose-limiting toxicities during the first cycle in patients who were ineligible for other therapies (3 + 3 design; Part 1). Once tolerability of the combination was confirmed, additional patients with no prior systemic therapy for uHCC were enrolled (Part 2). The primary endpoint was safety. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included overall survival and objective response rate, progression-free sur-vival, and time to progression using modified RECIST (mRECIST). Tumor assessments of complete or partial responses were confirmed >4 weeks after initial response. Results: As of 1 December 2017, 18 patients had received LEN + PEM (Part 1: n = 6; Part 2: n = 12). Patients had BCLC stage B (n = 6) or C (n = 12), Child-Pugh scores of 5 (n = 14) or 6 (n = 4), and four patients (22%) had received prior sorafenib.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2018","2018","33",,"77",,"1 Sep 2018","Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer causing morbidity. It adversely affects quality of life (QoL) from serious symptom burden. Methods: Health-related QoL (HRQoL) was evaluated descriptively for patients in a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study that compared the first-line systemic treatment lenvatinib (LEN) with sorafenib (SOR) in unresectable HCC. Key QoL outcomes for patients progressing <3 months versus >3 months were modeled longitudinally and summarized using area under the time curve (AUC) analyses. The difference in AUC was calculated with contrasting domain parameter estimates of a mixed model with time, group, timegroup, and a random intercept at baseline and Day 1 each cycle through Cycle 18. Results: A total of 954 patients were randomized to receive LEN (n = 478) or SOR (n = 476). Trial outcomes were median OS: LEN, 13.6 months versus SOR, 12.3 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.79-1.06); and median PFS: LEN, 7.4 months versus SOR, 3.7 months (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.57-0.77; P < 0.0001). Baseline HRQoL outcomes (e.g. EORTC QLQ-C30, HCC18, and EQ-5D) were markedly worse across most domains for patients who progressed earlier on treatment for both LEN and SOR arms (EQ-5D health utility index, 0.82 and 0.84 [respectively; <3 months] vs 0.88 and 0.86 [respectively; >3 months]). The difference in AUC for EORTC QLQ-C30 role functional status was 0.1644 (95% CI,-0.2281 to 0.5569; P = 0.4113) and for physical function was 0.0974 (95% CI,-0.3963 to 0.5911; P = 0.6989) favoring LEN. The difference in HCC-specific symptoms (HCC18) markedly favored LEN on sex life (dif,-0.4244), fatigue (dif,-0.1830), and nutrition (dif,-0.1522) and favored SOR on abdominal swelling (dif, 0.2021). Differences in symptoms related to jaundice, body image, and fever were minimal between treatment arms (dif, <0.05). Conclusions: More patients experienced disease progression earlier on therapy with SOR compared with LEN. In our analysis, baseline QoL was more severely impacted in HCC patients who progress earlier while on therapy, suggesting that patients treated with LEN have an added benefit in terms of QoL, as progression occurred later compared with SOR-treated patients. Functional and symptom differences in QOL measures, while not statistically significant, also favored patients treated with LEN.

In the RESORCE trial, regorafenib improved OS versus placebo in pts with HCC progressing on sorafenib (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.50, 0.78; Bruix J, 2017). This retrospective analysis explored whether HFSR with regorafenib was associated with OS in RESORCE. Methods: Pts in RESORCE who were randomized to regorafenib 160 mg/ day during the first 3 weeks of each 4-week cycle were divided into subgroups based on whether or not they had HFSR. Estimates of OS (95% CI) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Pts who were randomized, but not treated, were included in the no HFSR group for the analysis of survival. Results: Of 379 pts randomized, 374 received at least one dose of regorafenib. Of the treated pts, 53% (n = 199) had HFSR of any grade and 13% (n = 47) had grade 3 HFSR. Among pts with HFSR at any time during the study, 77% (n = 153) had the first HFSR event (any grade) during Cycle 1. Subgroups of pts with and without HFSR at any time had some imbalances in baseline characteristics (Table). OS was improved in pts who had HFSR at any time versus those who did not (Table). Pts who had a HFSR event during Cycle 1 also had improved OS versus those who did not (median OS 13.2 vs 8.5 months; HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51, 0.86). Conclusions: In this post-hoc exploratory analysis, HFSR with regorafenib was associated with improved OS, as was previously shown for sorafenib.

This exploratory analysis evaluated the impact of baseline AFP and c-Met on REG treatment benefit (OS and TTP) in the RESORCE trial. Methods: Circulating AFP and c-Met protein (shed ectodomain) levels were quantified by a Luminex assay (Myriad RBM) in plasma samples collected at baseline from patients enrolled in the RESORCE trial. Valid biomarker data were available from 497 (AFP) and 499 (c-Met) out of 573 patients. Patients were subgrouped according to the median protein concentration (high vs low), and the treatment effect HR and its 95% CI were evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model. The predictive effect was modeledas a protein-treatment interaction effect and subjected to Akaike information criterion (AIC)-based selection to assess its association with OS and TTP. Results: Baseline characteristics of patients were balanced across protein subgroups. While increased levels of both AFP (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.07, 1.12; P < 0.001) and c-Met (HR 1.32, CI 95% 1.06, 1.63; P = 0.011) were associated with a worse prognosis for OS, increased AFP levels were also associated with poor prognosis for TTP (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03, 1.07; P < 0.001). REG treatment benefit for both OS and TTP was independent of AFP and c-Met protein expression (Table). The protein-treatment interaction effect was not statistically significant.

The study met the primary endpoint, with a median overall survival of 10.2 months with cabozantinib vs 8.0 months with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; P = 0.0049). Median progression-free survival was 5.2 months with cabozantinib vs 1.9 months with placebo (HR, 0.44; P < 0.0001), and the ORR was 4% with cabozantinib vs 0.4% with placebo (P = 0.0086). Here, we report a further analysis of tumor response including the best percentage change at any timepoint in tumor target lesion size, the best percentage change at any timepoint in AFP levels, and time to progression (TTP). Methods: 707 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive cabozantinib 60 mg qd (n = 470) or placebo (n = 237). Eligible patients had pathologic diagnosed HCC, Child-Pugh score A and an ECOG status ≤1; must have received prior sorafenib with a maximum of 2 prior systemic therapies. Change in the sum of target lesion diameters (SOD) from baseline was determined every 8 weeks by investigator. Serum AFP levels were measured at baseline and every 8 weeks on the same schedule as tumor assessments. TTP was defined as the time from randomization to radiological progression or clinical deterioration and was determined retrospectively. Results: Based on the intention-to-treat population, 222 of 470 patients (47%) in the cabozantinib arm and 27 of 237 patients (11%) in the placebo arm had any postbaseline reduction in SOD as best response. 39 of 470 patients (8%) in the cabozantinib arm and 3 of 237 patients (1%) in the placebo arm had at least one postbaseline tumor assessment with ≥30% reduction in SOD. Patients in the cabozantinib arm with a ≥30% reduction in postbaseline SOD were 9% (n = 26/278) and 7% (n = 13/192) among those with a baseline AFP level < 400 ng/mL versus ≥400 ng/mL, respectively. Overall, 109 of 470 patients (23%) in the cabozantinib arm and 13 of 237 (5%) in the placebo arm had a ≥50% postbaseline decrease in serum AFP levels.

Date of Publication: 23 Aug 2018","2018","18","1",,,"23 Aug 2018","Background: The majority of patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suffer from underlying liver disease and are exposed to the risk of postoperative ascites, which is favored by an imbalance between portal venous inflow and a diminished hepatic volume. Finding a reversible, non-invasive method for modulating the portal inflow would be of interest as it could be used temporarily during the early postoperative course. Somatostatin, a well-known drug already used in several indications, may limit the risk of postoperative ascites and liver failure by decreasing portal pressure after hepatectomy for HCC in patients with underlying liver disease. We aimed to evaluate the impact of somatostatin postoperative infusion on the incidence of ascites following hepatectomy by laparotomy for HCC in patients with underlying liver disease. Methods/design: The SOMAPROTECT study is a multicenter randomized double-blind placebo controlled phase III trial comparing two arms of patients with underlying liver disease undergoing hepatectomy for HCC by open approach. All patients will have primary abdominal drainage before closure. Patients in the experimental arm will receive a postoperative intravenous infusion of somatostatin during 6 days. Patients in the control group will receive a placebo infusion for the same duration. The primary endpoint will be the presence or absence of postoperative ascites occurring during the 90-day postoperative course, defined as ≥500 ml/24 h of fluid in the drains during at least 3 days or any ascites requiring an invasive procedure comprising percutaneous puncture or drainage. Secondary endpoints will be duration and total volume of ascites, postoperative 90-day mortality and morbidity, liver failure, acute renal failure, length of stay in intensive care unit and hospital stay. The total number of patients to be enrolled was calculated to be 152. Discussion: Postoperative ascites remains a major issue after hepatectomy for HCC as it is associated with increased morbidity, liver and renal failure, the need for specific treatments and prolonged hospital stay. This study represents the first randomized controlled trial to assess the benefits of somatostatin on the risk of postoperative ascites after surgery for HCC.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02799212)",20180591294,30139340,L623576784,10.1186/s12885-018-4667-0

The main areas that we think will have the greatest impact are immune stimulation, control of efficacy, control of delivery, and safety. There is much excitement about the potential of this field to treat currently intractable cancer.

This exploratory analysis describes outcomes of sequential treatment with sorafenib followed by regorafenib. Methods: In RESORCE, 573 patients were randomized 2:1 to regorafenib 160 mg/day or placebo for 3 weeks on/1 week off. Efficacy and safety were evaluated by last sorafenib dose. The time from the start of sorafenib to death was assessed. Time to progression (TTP) in RESORCE was analyzed by TTP during prior sorafenib treatment. Results: HRs (regorafenib/placebo) for OS by last sorafenib dose were similar (0.67 for 800 mg/day; 0.68 for <800 mg/day). Rates of grade 3, 4, and 5 adverse events with regorafenib by last sorafenib dose (800 mg/day vs. <800 mg/day) were 52%, 11%, and 15% vs. 60%, 10%, and 12%, respectively.

Materials and Methods: A total of 812 patients with inoperable HCC were randomized (stable emulsion, n = 402; unstable emulsion, n = 410). The 2 emulsions were prepared by using the same protocol except that different solvents were used for chemotherapy agents, including epirubicin, lobaplatin, and mitomycin C. The solvent in the stable emulsion arm was contrast medium and distilled water, and the solvent in the unstable emulsion arm was distilled water. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints were time to progression (TTP), tumor response, adverse events (AEs), and plasma epirubicin concentrations. Results: In vitro, stable emulsions did not occur until 1 day, and unstable emulsions, with a lower peak plasma concentration (P =.001) in vivo, exhibited rapid separation of the oil and aqueous phases after 10 minutes. Median OS times in the stable and unstable emulsion arms were 17.7 and 19.2 months, respectively (P =.81). No differences were found in TTP, tumor response, and AEs except for myelosuppression (anemia, 3.5% vs 7.6%; thrombocytopenia, 11.5% vs 17.7%), which was significantly more severe and frequent in the unstable emulsion arm (P =.013). Conclusions: Chemoembolization is equally effective with the use of stable and unstable emulsions, but the use of a stable emulsion has the advantage of less myelosuppression and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01259414)",20180468022,30042075,L2000904946,10.1016/j.jvir.2018.03.027

Summary Background Data: Despite many promising retrospective data on the effect of neoadjuvant treatment for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC), no high-level evidence exists to support the role of such treatment. Methods: This phase 2/3 multicenter randomized controlled trial was designed to enroll 110 patients with BRPC who were randomly assigned to gemcitabine-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation treatment (54 Gray external beam radiation) followed by surgery or upfront surgery followed by chemoradiation treatment from four large-volume centers in Korea. The primary endpoint was the 2-year survival rate (2-YSR). Interim analysis was planned at the time of 50% case enrollment. Results: After excluding the patients who withdrew consent (n = 8) from the 58 enrolled patients, 27 patients were allocated to neoadjuvant treatment and 23 to upfront surgery groups. The overall 2-YSR was 34.0% with a median survival of 16 months. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the 2-YSR and median survival were significantly better in the neoadjuvant chemoradiation than the upfront surgery group [40.7%, 21 months vs 26.1%, 12 months, hazard ratio 1.495 (95% confidence interval 0.66-3.36), P = 0.028].

Objectives: The study aimed to describe real-life experience in advanced HCC treatment with SOR at a university hospital in Brazil and to estimate the number of patients with indication of second-line therapy. Methods: This is a retrospective study that included cases of HCC with prescription of SOR based on real-life practice between 2011 and 2016. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected. Results: From 572 patients with HCC, SOR was prescribed in 103 cases. From them, 62.1% were classified as Child-Pugh (CP)-A, 54.4% as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)-C, and 74 (71.8%) started treatment.

This randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial evaluated cabozantinib as compared with placebo in previously treated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS A total of 707 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive cabozantinib (60 mg once daily) or matching placebo. Eligible patients had received previous treatment with sorafenib, had disease progression after at least one systemic treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, and may have received up to two previous systemic regimens for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points were progression-free survival and the objective response rate. RESULTS At the second planned interim analysis, the trial showed significantly longer overall survival with cabozantinib than with placebo. Median overall survival was 10.2 months with cabozantinib and 8.0 months with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.92; P=0.005). Median progression-free survival was 5.2 months with cabozantinib and 1.9 months with placebo (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.52; P<0.001), and the objective response rates were 4% and less than 1%, respectively (P=0.009). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 68% of patients in the cabozantinib group and in 36% in the placebo group. The most common high-grade events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (17% with cabozantinib vs. 0% with placebo), hypertension (16% vs. 2%), increased aspartate aminotransferase level (12% vs. 7%), fatigue (10% vs. 4%), and diarrhea (10% vs. 2%). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment with cabozantinib resulted in longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo. The rate of high-grade adverse events in the cabozantinib group was approximately twice that observed in the placebo group.

Positive results in recent phase III clinical trials have confirmed the high value of anti-angiogenic therapies for HCC in both first (sorafenib and lenvatinib) and second line (regorafenib and cabozantinib) treatment modalities. However, failure of several large randomised controlled clinical trials over the last 10 years underlines the necessity for innovative treatment strategies and implementation of translational findings to overcome the unmet clinical need. Furthermore, the promising results from novel immunotherapies are likely to complement the landscape of active compounds for HCC and will require a completely different approach to patients, as well as the development of prognostic/predictive biomarkers. Given our increasing understanding of the most abundant molecular alterations in HCC, effective enrichment of patients based on clinical and molecular biomarkers, as well as adaptive clinical trials, are now feasible and should be implemented.

A key recommendation in the management of patients receiving sorafenib is to promote close communication between the patient and the physician so that adverse events (AEs) are detected early and severe AEs can be prevented. Sorafenib-related AEs have been identified as clinical biomarkers for sorafenib efficacy. Healthcare professionals have become more efficient in managing AEs, identifying patients who are likely to benefit from treatment, and assessing response to treatment, resulting in a trend towards increased overall survival in the sorafenib arms of clinical studies.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in this patient population. Methods: KEYNOTE-224 is a non-randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial that is set in 47 medical centres and hospitals across ten countries. Eligible patients had pathologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma; had previously been treated with sorafenib and were either intolerant to this treatment or showed radiographic progression of their disease after treatment; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–1; adequate organ function, and were Child-Pugh class A. Participants received 200 mg pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks for about 2 years or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal, or investigator decision. The primary endpoint was objective response, defined as the proportion of patients with complete or partial response in all patients who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab, which was radiologically confirmed by use of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 by central review. Safety was also assessed in all treated patients. This trial is ongoing but closed to enrolment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02702414. Findings: Between June 7, 2016, and Feb 9, 2017, we screened 169 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, of whom 104 eligible patients were enrolled and treated. As of data cutoff on Feb 13, 2018, 17 (16%) patients were still receiving pembrolizumab. We recorded an objective response in 18 (17%; 95% CI 11–26) of 104 patients. The best overall responses were one (1%) complete and 17 (16%) partial responses; meanwhile, 46 (44%) patients had stable disease, 34 (33%) had progressive disease, and six (6%) patients who did not have a post-baseline assessment on the cutoff date were considered not to be assessable. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 76 (73%) of 104 patients, which were serious in 16 (15%) patients. Grade 3 treatment-related events were reported in 25 (24%) of the 104 patients; the most common were increased aspartate aminotransferase concentration in seven (7%) patients, increased alanine aminotransferase concentration in four (4%) patients, and fatigue in four (4%) patients. One (1%) grade 4 treatment-related event of hyperbilirubinaemia occurred. One death associated with ulcerative oesophagitis was attributed to treatment. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in three (3%) patients, but there were no reported cases of viral flares. Interpretation: Pembrolizumab was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who had previously been treated with sorafenib. These results indicate that pembrolizumab might be a treatment option for these patients.

Other than lifestyle modification through diet and exercise, there are currently no other approved treatments for NASH/NAFLD. Although weight loss can be effective, it is difficult to achieve and sustain. In contrast, bariatric surgery can improve metabolic conditions associated with NAFLD, and has been shown to improve liver histology. To have approved regimens for the treatment of NASH/NAFLD, several issues must be addressed. First, all stakeholders must agree on the most appropriate clinical trial endpoints for NASH. Currently, resolution of NASH (without worsening fibrosis) or reduction of fibrosis stage (without worsening NASH) are the accepted endpoints by the regulatory authorities. It is important to recognize the prognostic implication of histologic features of NASH. In this context, although histologic NASH has been associated with advanced fibrosis, it is not an independent predictor of long-term mortality. In contrast, there are significant data to suggest that fibrosis stage is the only robust and independent predictor of liver-related mortality. In addition to the primary endpoints, several important secondary endpoints, including noninvasive biomarkers, long-term outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes must be considered. In 2018, a few phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of NASH have been initiated. Additionally, a number of phase 2a and 2b clinical trials targeting different pathogenic pathways in NASH are in the pipeline of emerging therapies.

Effective systemic therapies are scarce and they have been tested in the advanced stage. After decades of failures of immune therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as potentially effective treatments for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in the advanced stage. Immune checkpoints, including human cancer, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), are surface proteins expressed in a variety of immune cells, and mostly provide immunosuppressive signals. Monoclonal antibodies able to block these molecules have shown antitumor activity against a wide spectrum of human cancers. Clinical experience with checkpoint inhibitors in hepatocellular carcinoma includes early trials with the anti-CTLA-4 agent tremelimumab, and a large phase 2 trial with the anti-PD-1 agent nivolumab. The latter has shown strong activity particularly as second-line therapy, both in terms of tumor response and patient survival. A large phase 3 trial comparing nivolumab vs. standard of care sorafenib will report results soon. If positive, the landscape will change and new strategies should be tested. First, the activity of checkpoint inhibitors should be tested in patients at less advanced stages, including the adjuvant treatment of patients with resectable or ablatable tumors.

"Novel approaches in immunotherapy for HCC","Greten T.","Liver Cancer (2018) 7 Supplement 1 (73-74). Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2018","2018","7",,"73","74","1 Jul 2018","Treatment options for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are rapidly changing based on positive results from a number of clinical phase III trials evaluating targeted and immune-based treatment approaches in HCC. More agents targeting molecular pathways and immune checkpoints are currently under clinical evaluation. Some agents have already demonstrated improved outcome in HCC in the first-and second-line setting and are either awaiting FDA approval or have recently been approved. Based on these positive results investigators are trying a variety of different approaches to further improve the outcome for both targeted and immunotherapy in HCC. In our group we have been evaluating combination studies for a number of years, in which we combine locoregional therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In our first study we combined tremelimumab (anti-CTLA4) with locoregional therapies and observed a response rate of approximately 20% [1]. We have been able to demonstrate a correlation between treatment response and tumor infiltrating T cells; however, this observation was made in biopsies from patients already on treatment and therefore does not function as a prognostic marker. In a more recent analysis of possible immune correlates in patients treated with anti-CTLA4 we observed that patients with higher CD4+PD1+ T cell frequencies were more likely to respond to therapy. Currently, we are exploring murine HCC models to evaluate the best immune combination approach. As part of these studies we have also recently started looking at the effect of the gut microbiome on anti-tumor immunity in the liver. It is known that dysbiosis impairs the efficacy of immunotherapy including the immune checkpoint blockade anti-PD1 treatment in melanoma patients. However, the role of gut bacteria in anti-tumor surveillance in the liver is still poorly understood. Using a primary liver model, we found that altering commensal gut bacteria induced a liver-selective antitumor effect. A selective increase of hepatic CXCR6+ NKT cells was observed, independent of mouse strain, gender or presence of liver tumor. In vivo studies using both antibody-mediated cell depletion and NKT-deficient mice confirmed that NKT cells mediated inhibition of tumor growth in the liver. Further investigation showed that NKT cell accumulation was regulated by the expression of CXCL16, the solo ligand for CXCR6, on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, which form the lining of liver capillaries. Primary bile acids increased CXCL16 expression, while secondary bile acids showed the opposite effect. Removing gram-positive bacteria, which contains the bacteria mediating primary-tosecondary bile acid conversion, by vancomycin was sufficient to induce hepatic NKT cell accumulation and decrease liver tumor growth. Feeding secondary bile acids or colonization of bile acid-metabolizing bacteria reversed both NKT cell accumulation and inhibition of liver tumor growth in mice with altered gut commensal bacteria. In non-tumor liver tissue from patients with primary liver cancer, primary bile acid CDCA levels correlated with CXCL16 expression, the opposite was found with secondary bile acid GLCA indicating the finding also applies to humans [2].",,,,L623262803,10.1159/000490877
"Strategic application of radiotherapy for HCC","Seong J.","Liver Cancer (2018) 7 Supplement 1 (77). Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2018","2018","7",,"77",,"1 Jul 2018","External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is a well-established cancer modality in most major solid cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its role hasn't been recognized enough due to lack of high level evidence. However, its efficacy has been witnessed by soaring number of papers reporting beneficial clinical outcome as well as increasing level of evidence. Consequently major treatment guidelines start to either consider EBRT as one of the treatment options (NCCN guideline 2018) or just mention (AASLD guideline 2017) depending on disease status. EBRT can be administered in various ways. For small tumors, high dose focal radiation can be given in short term, which is referred to stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). It needs precision technology involving image-guided beam delivery (image guided radiotherapy) as well as motion control. For HCC beyond early stage, EBRT can be given using conventional or hypo-fractionation scheme, which is adopting preferably combination scheme with other modality, either as an additional treatment for HCCs showing incomplete result to TACE or as a combination of EBRT and vascular therapy for HCC accompanying vascular invasion. In HCC with major vascular invasion as portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT), recent nationwide multicenter study reported oncologic outcome of EBRT for HCC patients with PVTT with response rate 51.8% and better survival in responders (15.2 months) than in non-responders (6.9 months). More recently, encouraging results have come showing better outcome in combination of EBRT with TACE than in sorafenib in a phase 3 trial. In another phase 2 trial, combination of EBRT with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy showed median survival time as high as 18 months. In conclusion, strategic application of radiotherapy for HCC may bring local control of HCC, which can further be translated into improved oncologic outcome.",,,,L623262840,10.1159/000490877

Tislelizumab was specifically engineered to minimize FcgR binding on macrophages that, based on preclinical evidence, is believed to minimize potentially negative interactions with other immune cells. A first-in-human, phase 1A/1B study (NCT02407990) demonstrated that single-agent tislelizumab was generally well tolerated and showed preliminary evidence of antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors, including HCC. A recommended phase 3 dose of 200 mg administered intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) has been established for tislelizumab. Methods: This global, phase 3, randomized, multicenter study (NCT03412773) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab compared with sorafenib as a potential first-line treatment of unresectable HCC. Adult patients, aged ≥18 years, with unresectable, histologically confirmed HCC, an ECOG score ≤1, Child-Pugh A classification, BCLC Stage C disease or BCLC Stage B disease that has relapsed after loco-regional therapy, and who have not received prior systemic therapy, are being enrolled. Approximately 640 patients from 100 international centers are planned to be randomized (1:1) to receive tislelizumab 200 mg IV Q3W or sorafenib 400 mg orally BID. The primary outcome of this study is overall survival (OS) of patients treated with tislelizumab compared with OS of patients treated with sorafenib; secondary outcomes include objective response rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, time to progression, and quality-of-life outcomes. Safety/tolerability assessments include monitoring adverse events (AEs), including immune-related AEs, as well as physical examinations, vital signs, and electrocardiograms.

The current standard of care for 1 L treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic HCC is the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib. While single-agent inhibition of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling or VEGF has shown modest activity in HCC, evidence from a Phase I study (Stein ASCO 2018, submitted) supports combining atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) with bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) to achieve greater clinical benefit in HCC. In addition to its anti-angiogenic activity, bevacizumab may have immunomodulatory effects (increased DC maturation, enhanced T-cell infiltration, reduced MDSCs and Tregs in tumors) that have the potential to increase the efficacy of atezolizumab in the tumor microenvironment, thereby contributing to reinvigorating anti-tumor immunity. Methods: IMbrave150 (NCT03434379) is a global, multicenter, randomized, open-label Phase III study to evaluate atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic and/or unresectable HCC.

The reasons for failure of other pivotal drugs including sunitinib, linifanib, brivanib, and erlotinib have already been well discussed in several reviews and editorials. In summary, among all drugs, lenvatinib appears to have the most robust phase II results which suggested promising efficacy, as well as meticulous phase I results which led to a HCC-specific dosing schedule and lower toxicity. At this point, no other phase III studies are ongoing for single-agent molecular targeted therapy in 1st treatment of HCC. Instead, a large-scale phase III study for IO-MTT (atezolizumab-bevacizumab) combination was recently activated. It is likely that MTT not only works on driver signal transduction of cancer cells, but also on pivotal signal transduction pathways of environmental immune cells, thereby modulates host immune response against cancers.

We aimed to compare continuous hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy plus sorafenib with sorafenib alone in patients with advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. We did an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial (SILIUS) at 31 sites in Japan. Eligible patients were aged 20 years or older, with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma not suitable for resection, local ablation, or transarterial chemoembolisation; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1; Child-Pugh score 7 or lower; and adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function.

HCC may be responsive to immunotherapy due to higher expression of immunosuppressive cells and upregulation of CTLA-4 and PD-1 immune checkpoints (Gao et al 2009, Hato et al 2014, Pardee & Butterfield 2012). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are also associated with upregulation of regulatory T cells and PD-L1/PD-1 expression (Miroux et al 2010, Pardee & Butterfield 2012). Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 or CTLA4 immune checkpoints demonstrated clinical benefit in HCC as monotherapy. In preclinical studies, combination of anti-PDL1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies enhanced anti-tumor activity compared with monotherapy, indicating that the 2 pathways are non-redundant (Stewart, et al 2015).

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2018","2018","7",,"45",,"1 Jul 2018","Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) develop through the sequence of chronic inflammation, regeneration, and fibrosis regardless of its etiology. Deregulation of immunological network causes immune tolerance and suppression in tumor microenvironments during the carcinogenesis. The promise of immunotherapy seen in other tumors is also observed in HCC. For example, nivolumab, a programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, has shown promising anti-tumor activity with ORR of 18.6% and mOS of 15.6 months in advanced HCC who had been treated with sorafenib (CheckMate 040). These results have led to the design of a phase III clinical trial directly comparing sorafenib and nivolumab and its results will be available by the end of this year (CheckMate 459). Anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab also showed similar efficacy with ORR of 16.3% (KEYNOTE 394). On Sep 2017, US FDA granted accelerated approval to nivolumab as a second line therapy after sorafenib failure. Based on these promising clinical trials, 3 strategies of clinical investigation are currently being tested to evaluate the utility of immune checkpoint inhibitor as combination therapy. First, various phase II trials are underway to see the combination of PD1/PD-L1 blockade with other immunotherapies. Inhibition of PD-1 and PD-L1 only cannot stimulate cancer immunity in the absence of CD8+ T cells. Concurrent use of anti-CTLA-4 antibody results in CD8+ T cell proliferation, thus enhancing antitumor effects. In phase II trial, combined anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab and anti-CTLA-4 antibody tremelimumab in HCC showed ORR of 25%, and phase III trial of this combination as a first line therapy is currently ongoing. Secondly, PD1/PD-L1 blockade is being tested with targeted agents such as bevacizumab or sorafenib. Anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab can restore anticancer immunity, through T-cell mediated cancer cell killing, and this is further enhanced through bevacizumab's VEGF-mediated immunomodulatory effects. In GO30140 phase IB trial, combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab showed promising early efficacy in patients with advanced HCC with ORR of 61%, and phase III trial comparing atezolizumab and bevacizumab versus sorafenib as a first line therapy is currently ongoing. Third, combination with loco-regional therapies are also being investigated since TACE or RFA can activate tumor immunogenicity by releasing tumor-associated antigen and by inducing T-cell migration to metastasis. It is expected that subsequent administration of anti-PD-1 antibody may control small intrahepatic metastatic nodules. Immunotherapy is a rapidly evolving field in HCC. The results of ongoing clinical trials with combination strategies may drastically change the treatment landscape for HCC. In the era of precision medicine, the identification of clinical and immune biomarkers for immunotherapy is also crucial for precise immunotherapy.",,,,L623263356,10.1159/000490877

A phase III trial for advanced HCC shows favorable results for nivolumab compared to sorafenib. In order to evaluate the outcome of different therapeutic strategies, we compared two HCC mouse models. The orthotopic transplanted HCC fragment Hep-55.1c model and the inducible HCC mouse model (iAST) were extensively characterized ex vivo and in vivo in response to immunotherapies, and were compared to the clinical situation of HCC patients. Experimental Procedures Fragments of mouse Hep-55.1c tumors were implanted in the left lateral liver lobe of C57/Bl6 mice and tumor growth kinetic was monitored by μ-CT. HCC tumor growth in iAST mice was induced via intravenous injection of the adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase. iAST mice express a loxP flanked stop cassette and the SV40 large T-antigen under control of a hepatocyte-specific albumin promoter. Both tumor models were characterized with respect to immune infiltration, cytokine release, somatic mutational load and histopathological characteristics. Mice were treated using different immunotherapeutic agents in monotherapy or in combination such as anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4 or the TLR7/8 agonist R848. Human HCC samples were analyzed for mutational load by sequencing, while tumor architecture and immune infiltrate were analyzed by histology. Results Hep-55.1c tumors showed high stroma content accompanied by a low and disorganized vasculature whereas multinodular iAST tumors were highly vascularized lacking stroma content. Furthermore, a high mutational load and a strong immune cell infiltrate including cytotoxic T cells, NK cells and myeloid cells were found in Hep-55.1c tumors. The iAST tumors were characterized by a relatively low immune infiltrate and a small number of mutations. Comparison of these baseline results with data obtained from immunehistopathological analysis and sequencing of human HCC samples confirmed this differentiated picture in the clinics. Following treatment, iAST mice showed no response to immune checkpoint monotherapies and only a marginal number of reactive T cells was found within the tumor. In contrast, tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib led to tumor growth inhibition in iAST model. Treatment of mice bearing Hep-55.1c tumors with immunotherapy e.g. anti-PD-1 showed good response. Combination of anti-PD-1 with R848 increased therapeutic efficacy compared to monotherapies. Conclusions In this study, we have established two orthotopic HCC mouse models that reflect the diverse clinical situation of human HCC. Our findings demonstrate that the composition of the tumor microenvironment has a tremendous influence on the outcome of therapeutic strategies for HCC.

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2018","2018","78","13",,,"1 Jul 2018","Regorafenib is a small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have previously received sorafenib based on an improvement in overall survival versus placebo in the phase 3 randomized, double-blind RESORCE trial (NCT01774344; Bruix et al., Lancet, 2017). Expression of 776 plasma miRNAs was quantified by qPCR in baseline plasma samples collected from 343 of 573 patients (60%) from RESORCE (Teufel et al., ESMO2017, abs 705P). Predictive and prognostic effects of miRNAs were evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Nine miRNAs showed significant predictive association with overall survival. A survival benefit in favor of regorafenib was associated with increased plasma levels of miR-30a, miR-122, miR-125b, miR-200a and miR-374b, and decreased plasma levels of miR-15b, miR-107, miR-320 and miR-645. Here, we focus on the biological interpretation of these statistical results. Expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas was used to bridge from miRNAs via mRNAs to biological function. Gene set enrichment analysis of mRNAs based on correlation with expression of predictive miRNAs identified a list of the top 142 gene sets concordantly found for at least 6 of the 9 predictive miRNAs at a FDR of 0.01. Top gene sets showed consistent patterns related to HCC subtypes and several processes including liver cancer progression, metabolism of lipids, amino acids, bile acids and xenobiotics, glucuronidation, and doxorubicin resistance. Results suggested that response to regorafenib was improved in G4/G5/G6 versus G1/G2/G3 subtypes of the Boyault classification and in the CTNNB1 and Polysom7 subtypes of the Chiang classification which both coincide with the S3 subtype of the Hoshida classification (Hoshida et al., Seminars in liver disease, 30:35, 2010), a tumor subclass that is generally characterized by a retained hepatocyte-like phenotype, with well-differentiated and smaller tumors, and better survival. This is consistent with known roles of the predictive miRNAs in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, fibrogenesis, glycolysis, proliferation, and enhancement of apoptosis via several mechanisms. For example, miR-122 targets IGF1R, PDK4, LDHA and GALNT10, thereby regulating RAS/RAF/ERK signaling and glycolysis, which has been reported to overcome resistance to sorafenib. In summary, our results suggest that response to regorafenib is favorable in tumors with properties that are consistent with the S3 subtype of the Hoshida classification. Conclusions from this hypothesis-generating investigation require confirmation in follow-up studies with molecular characterization of tumor biopsies and regorafenib response data.",,,,L623504871,10.1158/1538-7445.AM2018-2606

However, few agents have shown efficacy. It is thought that the efficacy of some agents might have resulted from the heterogeneity of tumors, insufficient dosages due to liver cirrhosis, and post-therapy effects. In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promising clinical activity and safety in patients with advanced HCC. Areas covered: The authors provide an overview of chemotherapies used for the treatment of HCC, including ongoing trials. The authors also provide their expert opinion on the subject area and provide their future perspectives. Expert opinion: Based on favorable phase III clinical trial data, sorafenib and lenvatinib are considered promising agents for HCC as first-line systemic chemotherapy. Moreover, regorafenib and cabozantinib are useful second-line therapies after the failure of sorafenib. Furthermore, in early phase clinical trials, immune checkpoint inhibitors and the combinations of these inhibitors and molecular targeted agents have demonstrated promising activity. Therefore, better survival results are expected from future phase III clinical trials.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01658878)",20180497820,29913090,L623050038,10.1080/14656566.2018.1479398

We performed a prospective, open-label, non-comparative phase II study to assess survival with HAIC or HAIC converted to sorafenib. Methods: Fifty-five patients were prospectively enrolled. Patients received HAIC as a second course if they had complete response, partial response, or stable disease (SD) with an alpha fetoprotein (AFP) ratio < 1 or a des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) ratio < 1. Patients were switched to sorafenib if they had SD with an AFP ratio > 1 and a DCP ratio > 1 or disease progression. The primary endpoint was the 1-year survival rate. Secondary endpoints were the 2-year survival rate, HAIC response, survival rate among HAIC responders, progression-free survival, and adverse events. Results: Of the 55 patients in the intent-to-treat population, the 1-year and 2-year survival rates were 64.0 and 48.3%, respectively. After the first course of HAIC, one (1.8%) patient showed complete response, 13 (23.6%) showed partial response, 30 (54.5%) had SD, and 10 (18.1%) patients had progressive disease. Twenty-three patients (41.8%) had SD with AFP ratios < 1 or DCP ratios < 1, and 7 (12.7%) had SD with AFP ratios > 1 and DCP ratios > 1. Thirty-seven patients (68.5%) were responders and 17 (30.9%) were non-responders to HAIC. In responders, the 1-year and 2-year survival rates were 78 and 62%, respectively.

However, no randomised phase 3 trial has tested the combination of sorafenib with continuous arterial infusion chemotherapy. We aimed to compare continuous hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy plus sorafenib with sorafenib alone in patients with advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: We did an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial (SILIUS) at 31 sites in Japan. Eligible patients were aged 20 years or older, with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma not suitable for resection, local ablation, or transarterial chemoembolisation; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0–1; Child-Pugh score 7 or lower; and adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive web response system with a computer-generated sequence to receive 400 mg sorafenib orally twice daily or 400 mg sorafenib orally twice daily plus hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 and fluorouracil 330 mg/m(2) continuously on days 1–5 and 8–12 of every 28-day cycle via an implanted catheter system). The primary endpoint was overall survival. The primary efficacy analysis comprised all randomised patients (the intention-to-treat population), and the safety analysis comprised all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01214343. Findings: Between Nov 4, 2010, and June 10, 2014, 206 patients were randomly assigned (103 to the sorafenib group, 103 to the sorafenib plus hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy group). One patient in the sorafenib plus hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy group withdrew after randomisation.

Although licensed HBV vaccines are safe and effective in controlling HBV in healthy people younger than 40 years of age, vaccine efficacy decreases with age(1), in diabetics or smokers(2), in people with compromised immunity, or because of non-compliance with the required regimen(1). In both the US and Europe, there have been significant decreases in the incidence rates of acute HVB, however, the prevalence of chronic HBV and HBV carriers has actually remained constant or even increased. Europe, more so than the US, faces an increased risk of HBV due to the higher numbers of migrants and refugees(3). Thus, a more potent vaccine that is safe and protects faster or with fewer doses may address both public health and compliance needs. We tested the ability of Sci-B-Vac™, a third generation HBV vaccine containing the Pre-S1, Pre-S2 and S components of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) to elicit robust HBV immunity(4). Recently we developed an ELISA to measure PreS1 and preS2 antibodies. The seroprotec-tion rate (SPR ≥ 10 mIU/mL) in the clinical studies was determined with the Cobas(TM) assay. We also optimized an IFN-g ELISpot assay to enumerate IFN-g secreting Hep-B Specific T cells, to determine if humoral immune responses translate to robust cell mediated immune responses, in subjects immunized with Sci-B-Vac™. Intraperitoneal immunization of mice with Sci-B-Vac™ led to the robust induction of HBsAg antibodies and the generation of IFN-g+ T cells against Pre-S2 and S. The phase 4 clinical study in 91 Israeli adults demonstrated rapid seroprotection and high HBsAg geometric mean titers after only 2 vaccinations, with robust induction of HBsAg specific memory B cells. The vaccine was well tolerated and safe. SPR at 1, 3 and 7 months were 56.8%, 98.8% and 100%, respectively. The majority of individuals with high HBsAg geometric mean titers also possessed antibodies against Pre-S1 and Pre-S2. Efforts are underway to test T cell responses in subjects from the Phase 4 clinical trial cohort to further probe the correlation between Sci-B-Vac™ induced humoral and cell mediated immune responses and to confirm the benefit of including Pre-S1 and Pre-S2 in the vaccine candidate.

The pangenotypic DAA regimen G/P (glecaprevir [NS3/4A inhibitor discovered by AbbVie and Enanta] coformulated with pibrentasvir [NS5A inhibitor]) is approved to treat HCV infection and demonstrated a 98% overall cure rate in clinical trials. We pooled data from 7 phase 3 clinical trials conducted in over 2000 patients and performed an integrated analysis evaluating the safety and efficacy of G/P in patients with baseline metabolic syndrome. Materials-&-Methods: The analysis included patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 infection and baseline metabolic syndrome de-fined according to the ATP III criteria who received G/P treatment for 8, 12 or 16 weeks. Patients with or without severe renal impairment, and without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, could be either treatment-naïve or experienced with interferon (IFN) or pegIFN with or without ribavirin (RBV) or sofosbuvir and RBV with or without pegIFN. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12). Adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were recorded in all patients to monitor safety and tolerability Results: The analysis included 349 patients, the majority of whom were male (208; 60%), white (265; 76%), HCV treatment-naïve (244; 70%), and without cirrhosis (275; 79%).

Here, we report a secondary analysis of tumor response including the best percentage change at any timepoint in tumor target lesion size, the best percentage change at any timepoint in serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, and time to progression (TTP). Methods: A total of 707 patients, stratified by disease etiology, geographic region, and extent of disease, were randomized 2:1 to receive cabozantinib 60 mg once daily (n=470) or placebo (n=237). Eligible patients had a pathologic diagnosis of HCC, Child-Pugh score A, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status-1. Patients must have received prior sorafenib and were allowed up to 2 lines of prior systemic therapy for HCC. Change in the sum of target lesion diameters (SOD) from baseline was determined every 8 weeks by the investigator. Best percentage change in SOD was defined as the maximum reduction in SOD at any postbaseline timepoint. Serum AFP levels were measured centrally at baseline and every 8 weeks on the same schedule as tumor assessments. TTP was defined as the time from randomization to radiological progression or clinical deterioration and was determined retrospectively. Results: Based on the intention-to-treat population, 222 of 470 patients (47%) in the cabozantinib arm and 27 of 237 patients (11%) in the placebo arm had any postbaseline reduction in SOD as a best response. Thirty-nine of 470 patients (8%) in the cabozantinib arm and 3 of 237 patients (1%) in the placebo arm had at least 1 postbaseline tumor assessment with a-30% reduction in SOD. The percentages of patients in the cabozantinib arm with a-30% reduction in postbaseline SOD were 9% (n=26/278) and 7% (n=13/192) among those with a baseline AFP level <400 ng/mL versus-400 ng/mL, respectively. Overall, 109 of 470 patients (23%) in the cabozantinib arm and 13 of 237 (5%) in the placebo arm had a-50% postbaseline decrease in serum AFP levels. Median TTP was 5.4 months with cabozantinib versus 1.9 months with placebo (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.34-0.49).

REACH-2 was designed to confirm the ramucirumab treatment benefit for patients with baseline AFP -400 ng/mL first observed in the prespecified subgroup of patients in REACH with AFP -400 ng/mL. The primary endpoint of REACH-2 was met demonstrating an improved overall survival (OS) compared to PBO, a result consistent with that in patients with AFP -400 ng/mL in REACH. Pooled analyses of patients from REACH-2 and REACH with baseline AFP -400 ng/mL was performed. Methods: With the exception of AFP levels, eligibility for both REACH-2 and REACH were similar, and included patients who had advanced HCC, Child-Pugh <7, ECOG PS 0 or 1; BCLC stage C or B refractory/not amenable to locoregional therapy, -1 measurable lesion; adequate hematologic and biochemical parameters, and disease progression during or following, or intolerance to sorafenib. All patients received RAM (8 mg/kg) I.V. or PBO every 14 days. In both studies, patients were treated until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity/withdrawal criterion was met. Pooled analyses include assessment of OS, progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Pooled efficacy analysis were stratified by study to account for any potential difference in the two studies. Results: 542 patients were pooled from REACH (250) and REACH-2 (292) (N=316 RAM vs N=226 PBO).

Improvements in PFS (median PFS 2.8 mo vs 1.5 mo PBO; HR 0.572; 95% CI 0.472, 0.694; p<.0001), ORR (5.4% RAM vs 0.9% PBO (p=.0040), and disease control rate (ORR + stable disease=56.3% RAM vs 37.2% PBO [p<.0001]) were observed. The relative dose intensity was 98.3% RAM vs 99.6% PBO. 9.5% of patients on the RAMarm vs 3.6% on PBO discontinued study treatment due to adverse events (AEs) related to study treatment. Hypertension (12.0% RAM vs 3.6% PBO) and hyponatremia (5.1% RAM vs 2.2%PBO) were the only Grade (G) -3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in-5% in RAM.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2018","2018","29",,"v51",,"1 Jun 2018","Introduction: Unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 70% of diagnosed HCC. Tislelizumab (previously known as BGB-A317) is a humanized, IgG4 monoclonal antibody with high affinity and binding specificity for programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1). Furthermore, tislelizumab was specifically engineered to minimize FcgR binding on macrophages, thereby abrogating antibody-dependent phagocytosis, a potential mechanism of T-cell clearance. A first-in-human, phase 1A/1B study (NCT02407990) demonstrated that single-agent tislelizumab was generally well tolerated and showed evidence of antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors, including HCC. A recommended phase 3 dose of 200 mg administered intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) has been established for tislelizumab. Methods: This global, phase 3, randomized, multicenter study (NCT03412773) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab compared with sorafenib as a first-line treatment of unresectable HCC. Adult patients, aged-18 years, with unresectable, histologically confirmed HCC, an ECOG score-1, Child-Pugh A classification, BCLC Stage C disease or BCLC Stage B disease that has relapsed after locoregional therapy, and who have not received prior systemic therapy, are being enrolled. Approximately, 640 patients from 100 international centers will be randomized (1:1) to receive tislelizumab 200 mg IV Q3W or sorafenib 400 mg orally BID. The primary outcome of this non-inferiority study is overall survival (OS) of patients treated with tislelizumab compared with OS of patients treated with sorafenib; secondary outcomes include objective response rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, time to progression, and quality-of-life outcomes. Safety/tolerability assessments include monitoring adverse events (AEs), including immune-related AEs, as well as physical examinations, vital signs, and electrocardiograms. Exploratory endpoints include assessment of potential predictive biomarkers, characterization of the tislelizumab pharmacokinetic profile in patients with HCC, and to determine host immunogenicity against tislelizumab.",,,,L623151837,10.1093/annonc/mdy151

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2018","2018","29",,"v92",,"1 Jun 2018","Introduction: Management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver metastasis (mets) requires complementary expertise of multiple specialties. Treatment decisions are increasingly complex and physicians must face a wide range of underlying liver dysfunctions and concomitant malignancies. Among available treatments, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well-tolerated. Yet, like with all radiation therapy (RT) techniques, the energy dose deposit needs to be maximized in tumor cells without affecting the surrounding healthy tissues. For such purpose, nanoparticles of hafnium oxide, NBTXR3, were designed to effectively absorb ionizing radiation and augment the dose deposited within the tumor cells only when activated by RT. NBTXR3 is characterized by one single administration before the first RT session and it fits into existing standard of care with no change in patient treatment schedule protocol or equipment occupancy. It is currently evaluated in a phase I/II clinical trial bringing together multiple medical fields to introduce the use of NBTXR3 with SBRT in patients with HCC or liver mets [NCT02721056]. Methods: The trial follows a 3+3 dose escalation design at dose levels of NBTXR3 corresponding to 10%, 15%, 22%, 33% and 45% of the baseline tumor volume. Treatment is performed as a single intralesional or intraarterial injection followed by SBRT (45Gy / 3 fractions / 5 to 7 days) on patients with HCC with/without Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis or liver mets. As SBRT is not supported by all French hospitals, the coordination of two institutions was needed in managing the patients course. This study aims primarily at identifying the Recommended Dose and of early Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs). Secondary endpoints include target lesions investigator assessment by mRECIST via MRI. Results: The first two dose levels at 10% and 15% are completed with 6 and 4 patients respectively. Two patients are currently included at the third dose level at 22%. All currently recruited patients were treated by intralesional injection. No early DLTs nor adverse events (AE) related to NBTXR3 were observed. One grade 2 malaise and two grade 3 abdominal pain AEs were reported to be related to the injection procedure. No serious adverse events related to NBTXR3 nor to the injection procedure were observed. Dispersion and permanence assessments by CT scan confirmed NBTXR3 to stay within the tumor without negatively impacting liver functions nor the reliability of the image-guided radiation therapy. Investigator assessment on target lesions by mRECIST via MRI resulted with the following best observed responses of target lesions to date in 7 evaluable patients: 3 complete responses, 3 partial responses and 1 stable disease. Conclusion: Overall, NBTXR3 is well tolerated with a positive safety profile. Indeed, NBTXR3 could constitute an encouraging perspective for patients vulnerable to liver complications. The success of the cooperation between different medical disciplines and several sites paves the way to an innovative mean of managing multidisciplinary affections. In parallel, NBTXR3 is also evaluated in 5 other clinical trials, including a phase II/III in soft tissue sarcoma [NCT02379845] and phases I/II for head and neck [NCT01946867; NCT02901483], prostate [NCT02805894] and rectum cancers [NCT02465593].",,,,L623151969,10.1093/annonc/mdy150

HCC often lacks argininosuccinate synthetase, a citrulline to arginine-repleting enzyme. ADI-PEG 20 is a cloned arginine degrading enzyme-arginine deiminase- conjugated with polyethylene glycol. The goal of this study was to evaluate this agent as a potential novel therapeutic for HCC after first line systemic therapy. Methods and patients: Patients with histologically proven advanced HCC and Child-Pugh up to B7 with prior systemic therapy, were randomized 2: 1 to ADI-PEG 20 18 mg/m(2) versus placebo intramuscular injection weekly. The primary end point was overall survival (OS), with 93% power to detect a 4-5.6 months increase in median OS (one-sided α=0.025). Secondary end points included progression-free survival, safety, and arginine correlatives. Results: A total of 635 patients were enrolled: median age 61, 82% male, 60% Asian, 52% hepatitis B, 26% hepatitis C, 76% stage IV, 91% Child-Pugh A, 70% progressed on sorafenib and 16% were intolerant.

Post hoc analyses of arginine assessment at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks, demonstrated a trend of improved OS for those with more prolonged arginine depletion. Conclusion: ADI-PEG 20 monotherapy did not demonstrate an OS benefit in second line setting for HCC. It was well tolerated. Strategies to enhance prolonged arginine depletion and synergize the effect of ADI-PEG 20 are underway.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01287585)",,29659672,L623320359,10.1093/annonc/mdy101

Liver diseases particularly hepatitis B virus infections, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma continue to pose a significant health challenge worldwide due to the lack of therapeutic management options besides liver resection and transplantation. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. HCC has a high mortality rate because of poor diagnosis. The majority of patients with liver cancer die within one year as a result of poor patient compliance. HCC is clinically treated by chemotherapy besides surgery. However, most anticancer drugs have high toxicity and low specificity, leading to systemic toxicity and severe side effects. To limit the severe side effects of cancer chemotherapy on normal tissues, tumor targeting drug delivery systems need to be explored, which provides the impetus to develop targeted therapies for achieving higher efficacy with minimal side effects. The nanostructures used as good drug carriers, possess advantages of good solubility including high drug encapsulation efficiency, high cellular uptake, further desirable pharmacokinetics and can preferentially accumulate at the tumor site through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect with the goal of minimizing toxic effects on healthy tissues while maintaining antitumor efficacy.",,20180206198,28884605,L621356529,10.1080/21691401.2017.1374282

The aim of this phase 3 study was to confirm the results of the phase 2 trial. Methods: We did a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 90 centres in Australia, the Americas, Europe, and New Zealand. Eligible patients were 18 years or older and had unresectable, histologically confirmed, hepatocellular carcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–1, high MET expression (MET-high; staining intensity score ≥2 in ≥50% of tumour cells), Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, and radiographically-confirmed disease progression after receiving sorafenib-containing systemic therapy. We randomly assigned patients (2:1) in block sizes of three using a computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive oral tivantinib (120 mg twice daily) or placebo (twice daily); patients were stratified by vascular invasion, extrahepatic spread, and α-fetoprotein concentrations (≤200 ng/mL or >200 ng/mL). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat and safety analyses were done in all patients who received any amount of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01755767. Findings: Between Dec 27, 2012, and Dec 10, 2015, 340 patients were randomly assigned to receive tivantinib (n=226) or placebo (n=114). At a median follow-up of 18·1 months (IQR 14·1–23·1), median overall survival was 8·4 months (95% CI 6·8–10·0) in the tivantinib group and 9·1 months (7·3–10·4) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·97; 95% CI 0·75–1·25; p=0·81). Grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 125 (56%) of 225 patients in the tivantinib group and in 63 (55%) of 114 patients in the placebo group, with the most common being ascites (16 [7%] patients]), anaemia (11 [5%] patients), abdominal pain (nine [4%] patients), and neutropenia (nine [4%] patients) in the tivantinib group. 50 (22%) of 226 patients in the tivantinib group and 18 (16%) of 114 patients in the placebo group died within 30 days of the last dose of study medication, and general deterioration (eight [4%] patients) and hepatic failure (four [2%] patients) were the most common causes of death in the tivantinib group. Three (1%) of 225 patients in the tivantinib group died from a treatment-related adverse event (one sepsis, one anaemia and acute renal failure, and one acute coronary syndrome). Interpretation: Tivantinib did not improve overall survival compared with placebo in patients with MET-high advanced hepatocellular carcinoma previously treated with sorafenib. Although this METIV-HCC trial was negative, the study shows the feasibility of doing integral tissue biomarker studies in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional randomised studies are needed to establish whether MET inhibition could be a potential therapy for some subsets of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

However, it is limited by its relatively low sensitivity and specificity and inter-operator variability. The GALAD score is a serum biomarker-based statistical model that predicts the probability of having HCC in patients with chronic liver disease. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a major component of the GALAD score. The performance of the GALAD score for detection of AFP negative HCC remains to be determined. In this study, we aimed to compare the performance of the GALAD score to liver ultrasound for detection of AFP negative HCC. Methods: Patients with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B seen at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, between October 2013 and October 2016 who had AFP, AFP-L3%, and DCP measured as part of their clinical care or consented to have their serum stored for measurement of these tumor markers, were included. Controls were those without HCC as confirmed by cross sectional imaging and at least six months follow up. Cases and controls with AFP ≥20 ng/ml were excluded. The GALAD score was calculated using the formula -10.08 + 1.67 x [Gender (1 for male, 0 for female)] + 0.09 x [Age] + 0.04 x [AFP-L3%] + 2.34 x log[AFP] + 1.33 x log[DCP]. Identification of a solid lesion in the liver by ultrasound was considered positive ultrasound. AUC was used to compare the performance of these models. Results: A total of 47 cases and 175 controls were included. 32 (68%) had early stage HCC, of whom 10 had very early stage HCC (BCLC 0, single tumor less than 2 cm in diameter). The AUC of the GALAD score for detection of HCC was 0.90 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86-95], which was higher than the AUC of ultrasound (AUC, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74-0.85; P<0.01) (Figure A). At a cut off of -1.18, the GALAD score had a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 81% for HCC detection. The AUC of the GALAD score for detection of early stage HCC remained high at 0.88 [95%CI: 0.81-0.94] (cut off -1.18, sensitivity 84%, specificity 81%), which was higher than the AUC of ultrasound (AUC, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.74-0.86; P=0.026) (Figure B). Finally, the AUC of the GALAD score for very early stage HCC detection remained high at 0.88 [95%CI: 0.82-0.95] (cut off -1.70, sensitivity 100%, specificity 73%), which was higher than the AUC of ultrasound (AUC, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72-0.84; P=0.011). Conclusion: The performance of the GALAD score was superior to that of ultrasound for detection of AFP negative early stage HCC. The performance of the GALAD score should be investigated in prospective phase 3 biomarker studies. [Figure Presented]",,,,L2000765282,10.1016/S0016-5085(18)34052-6

However, the median progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with HCC and major portal vein tumor thrombosis treated with sorafenib monotherapy is no more than 3 months. A prospective single-arm phase II study was conducted to determine whether adding hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin to sorafenib could improve on these results. Methods: Thirty five patients were treated with sorafenib 400 mg orally twice a day, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) HAI on day 1, leucovorin 400 mg/m(2) HAI on days 1, and 5-fluorouracil 2800 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2, repeated every 21 days.

Methods: This is a secondary analysis of the comparator arm (sorafenib arm) of the NCT00699374 study which is a phase III multicenter study conducted between 2008 and 2010. The univariate probability of overall and progression-free survival was assessed among different patient subsets through Kaplan–Meier analysis and log-rank testing. Multivariate analysis of factors affecting overall and progression-free survival was then conducted through Cox regression analysis. Results: All patients within the comparator (sorafenib) arm were included in the analysis (N = 544 patients).

Likewise, in multivariate analysis, non-Asian race (P = 0.004), grade 1 ALBI score (P = 0.001), ECOG performance score of 0 (P = 0.006), and no extra-hepatic spread (P = 0.005) were associated with better progression-free survival. Moreover, development of high-grade hand–foot skin reaction was associated with a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (P = 0.003), which was further confirmed in a multivariate analysis adjusted for other relevant baseline factors (P = 0.002).

Date of Publication: 1 May 2018","2018","194","5","500",,"1 May 2018","Introduction and objectives: Modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT), is a particular kind of hyperthermia in oncology. It considers the heterogeneous structure of the tumor and provides selective thermal actions instead of the homogenous heating. Its advantages are the stable safety, extra low toxicity and systemic effect of the local treatment. The systemic effect is made by the development of the immunogenic celldeath and produces an abscopal effect, excluding the relapse of the same tumor in the system. Our presentation intends to show the clinical studies of mEHT in variously advanced primary and metastatic malignancies. Materials and methods: The collected results are by well-known and widely applied evidence-based medicine. Prospective Phase II and Phase III oncothermia trials exist, together with some retrospective studies. All the retrospective data are compared to large databases and/ or historical arms, and many are compared to the multiple clinical practices making statistical evidence of the validity of the data. Multiple clinical studies are in progress at various university research centers including preparation of one FDA controlled trial in the USA. Results: Such sensitive organs like the brain were successfully treated even with high dose mEHT without extra side effects. The clinical advantages of glioma treatment show important addition to the survival time like it is shown recently in. The small and non-small lung cancer were also successfully treated with mEHT, even in advanced cases. The gastrointestinal malignancies are also treated successfully with the mEHT method. The liver metastases in colorectal tumors, the primary hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreas carcinoma and unresectable biliary cancer were clinically examined with positive results; in gynecology for ovary, for breast and in cervix. Bone metastases, sarcomas, and even the mEHT treatment of malignant ascites proof the theoretical and experimental results in clinical practice.

Patients in the adjuvant TACE group had 7.8% higher 3-year OS rate than the control group (85.2% vs. 77.4%; P ¼ 0.04; HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36–0.97). The impact of adjuvant TACE on RFS and OS remained significant after controlling for other known prognostic factors (HR, 0.67; P ¼ 0.01 for RFS; and HR, 0.59; P ¼ 0.04 for OS). There was no grade 3 or 4 toxicity after adjuvant TACE. Conclusions: For patients with HBV-related HCC who had an intermediate or high risk of recurrence after curative hepatectomy, our study showed adjuvant TACE significantly reduced tumor recurrence, improved RFS and OS, and the procedure was well tolerated.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01966133)",,29420221,L622326550,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-2899

Here, we present 24-month (M) data in living-donor LT recipients (LDLTR) with underlying HCC who were randomized to receive EVR plus reduced-dose tacrolimus (EVR+rTAC) vs standard-dose tacrolimus (sTAC). Methods: H2307 (NCT01888432) was a 24M, multicenter, open-label, phase III study, in which de novo LDLTR (N=284) were randomized (1:1) on Day 30 post-LT to EVR+rTAC (n=142) or sTAC (n=142). Efficacy parameters including composite efficacy failure (CEF: treated biopsy proven acute rejection [tBPAR], graft loss [GL] or death), renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [EGFR]; MDRD4), and HCC recurrence as well as safety parameters such as adverse events (AEs) were evaluated in patients who had HCC at LT. Results: Of 284 patients, 117 who had HCC at LT were randomized to receive EVR+rTAC (N=56) or sTAC (N=61). HCC-related baseline parameters were comparable between both arms; majority of the LDLTR were within Milan criteria (Table1). CEF and its components were numerically higher, but not significantly different in EVR+rTAC vs sTAC at M24 in the HCC subpopulation (CEF: 12.5% vs 6.5% [90%CI, -9.2, 21.1]; tBPAR: 3.6% vs 1.6% [90%CI, -13.3, 17.2]; GL/death: 8.9% vs 4.8% [90%CI, -11.1, 19.2]). The change in mean EGFR from randomization to M24 was significantly better with EVR+rTAC vs sTAC (-2.37 vs -10.16 mL/min/1.73m2, P=0.035). HCC recurrence was seen in 6 patients (9.8%) in sTAC vs 1 in EVR+rTAC arm (1.8%, P=0.116; Table1). Incidence of AEs in the HCC subpopulation was comparable between EVR+rTAC (100%) vs sTAC (93.4%). Conclusion: EVR+rTAC was associated with comparable safety and better efficacy with regard to diminished renal function loss as well as a trend towards lower HCC recurrence compared with sTAC in LDLTR with underlying HCC.",,,,L622539256,

Methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, non-inferiority Phase 3 study comparing LEN to SOR as first-line in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma systemic treatments. Longitudinal modelling of the EQ-5D Health Utility Index (HUI) was conducted to estimate the effect of treatment assignment (LEN versus SOR) on change from Baseline. Results: Overall, a total of 954 patients (478 patients in the LEN treatment arm and 476 in the SOR treatment arm) were randomized. Baseline demographic and health information characteristics were not significantly different between treatment arms. In the EQ-5D, the mean change from Baseline visual analogue scale scores were observed to decrease with worsening modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors categories, with associated standardized effect size scores that decreased as disease severity increased. LEN and SOR arms had similar health utility scores at all baseline (Baseline: 0.804 versus 0.811, respectively). Previously presented post-Baseline progression-free survival visits were 19.7% lower for LEN (adjusted change from Baseline:-0.041 versus-0.050, respectively). A slight improvement in HUI scores (10.3%) were observed in LEN patients at disease progression based on the first post-Baseline progression visit (adjusted change from Baseline:-0.110 versus-0.122). Conclusions: Overall, these data illustrate that the LEN and SOR arms had similar health utility scores at all post-baseline, progression-free survival visits, with a slight improvement in HUI scores observed in LEN patients at disease progression.

Methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, noninferiority Phase 3 study comparing lenvatinib (LEN) to sorafenib (SOR) as first-line uHCC systemic treatments. 954 patients were randomized to LEN (N= 478) or SOR (N= 476). Analyses on the individual items of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and HCC18, were conducted using longitudinal generalized estimation equations (GEE) of the postbaseline, treated period assessments for these items. Forest plots of the odds ratios (OR) and associated confidence intervals (CI) from the GEE analyses were generated to characterize the likelihood of a 2-grade categorical deterioration (eg, deteriorate by 2 categories on the verbal response scale) on individual items for patients treated with LEN compared to SOR during the treatment period. Results: The likelihood of patients experiencing a 2-grade deterioration over the course of the post-baseline treatment period was statistically equivalent for most EORTC-QLQ-C30 and HCC18 items (OR ∼ 1.0) with the exception of pain in the shoulder, weight being too low, and reduced activity. Patients treated with SOR were 38% less likely to observe a 2-grade deterioration in shoulder pain (OR= 0.7107, CI= 0.5611-0.9003, p-value= 0.0046). Patients treatment with LEN were 25% less likely to observe a 2-grade deterioration in weight being too low (OR= 1.2502, CI= 1.0014-1.5609, p-value= 0.0485) and 27% less likely to observe a 2-grade deterioration in activity reduction (OR= 1.2658, CI= 1.0158-1.5774, p-value= 0.0358). Conclusions: These data provide detailed information on the cumulative probability of categorical deterioration of individual items on the EORTCQLQ-C30 and HCC18. These results show a similar trend with additional benefit of LEN in terms of anorexia or activity over the course of treatment, which are two key areas for patients especially the ability to perform activities.",,,,L623584023,

This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Regorafenib for advanced HCC patients following Sorafenib treatment compared with best supportive care (BSC) in the third-party payer's and the U.S. societal perspectives. Methods: A Markov model with a five-year horizon and one month cycle was simulated using the clinical data of RESOURCE. Possible health transitions reflected three states (Stable disease, Progressive disease, and Death). The third-party payer's perspective analysis was conducted based on costs of managing patients and out-of-pocket costs. In the societal perspective analysis, time costs of informal caregivers and non-time costs were considered additionally. All costs were measured in 2017 USD. QALYs were calculated based on EQ-5D. A 3% time discount rate was used in the societal perspective analysis and 7% in the third-party payer's analysis. Results: Incremental QALYs for Regorafenib compared to BSC was 0.12 (0.51 vs 0.39). Total costs was $33,434 higher in Regorafenib from the societal perspective ($65,901 vs $ 32,467). Thus, ICERs was $ 277,463/QALY, which exceeds a U.S. societal willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $150,000. One-way sensitivity analysis ($206,740/QALY ∼ $509,485/QALY) demonstrated that ICER was sensitive to the overall survival of Regorafenib and BSC and daily dose of Regorafenib. According to probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the likelihood of Regorafenib being cost-effective was shown to be 4.7% and would not reach 50% otherwise WTP increased up to $270,000. Conclusions: Regorafenib is not a cost-effective alternative to BSC for patients with advanced HCC from the U.S. societal perspective.

Increased VEGF and VEGFR2 expression is associated with high AFP expression in HCC tumors. Ramucirumab (RAM), a human IgG1 mAb, inhibits activation of VEGFR2. REACH-2 was designed to confirm the benefit of RAM treatment observed in the REACH study in pts with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL. Methods: Eligible pts were ≥18 yrs, had HCC with BCLC stage C or B disease refractory or not amenable to locoregional therapy, baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL, Child-Pugh A, ECOG PS 0 or 1, adequate hematologic and biochemical parameters, had progressed on or following, or were intolerant to sorafenib. Pts were randomized (2:1) to receive RAM 8 mg/kg iv or placebo (PL) Q2W plus best supportive care, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary objectives included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 and safety. Results: 292 pts were randomized to RAM (197) or PL (95). Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between arms. RAM treatment significantly improved OS (median OS 8.5 mo vs 7.3 mo PL; HR 0.710; 95% CI 0.531, 0.949; p=.0199). RAM significantly improved PFS (median PFS 2.8 mo vs 1.6 mo PL; HR 0.452; 95% CI 0.339, 0.603; p<.0001).

Single-agent immunotherapy with PD-L1/PD-1 blockade or treatment (Tx) with anti-angiogenic bevacizumab (bev; anti-VEGF) has shown modest activity in HCC. We hypothesized that the combination of atezolizumab (atezo; anti-PD-L1) + bev results in a greater clinical benefit due to the additional immunomodulatory effects of bev (increased DC maturation, enhanced T-cell infiltration, reduced MDSCs and Tregs in tumors), which create a more favorable tumor microenvironment that potentiates the efficacy of atezo. Methods: Patients (pts) with unresectable or metastatic HCC who were naive to systemic Tx were enrolled in a Phase Ib study cohort (NCT02715531). Pts received atezo (1200 mg) + bev (15 mg/kg) IV every 3 weeks until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination. Secondary efficacy endpoints included ORR, PFS, DOR and time to progression (TTP) per RECIST v1.1; and OS. Results: As of the data cutoff (October 24, 2017), 26 pts were evaluable for safety. Tx-related all-grade AEs occurred in 21 pts (81%). Tx-related grade 3-4 AEs were seen in 9 pts (35%), most commonly hypertension (n = 5 [19%]). No grade 5 AEs were observed. Two pts (8%) experienced 3 Tx-related grade 3 serious AEs (autoimmune encephalitis, mental status change and intra-abdominal hemorrhage). Immune-related AEs requiring corticosteroid Tx occurred in 3 pts (12%).

The median estimates for PFS, DOR, TTP and OS have not yet been reached. Conclusions: The combination of atezo + bev is safe and well tolerated; no new safety signals were identified beyond the established safety profile for each agent.

The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, clinical activity and immune dynamic biomarkers of a small molecule icaritin, IL-6/STAT3 immune-modulator in advanced HCC. Methods: Major eligibility criteria include histologically confirmed unresectable HCC patients with Child-Pugh Class A or B liver function. Total of 70 advanced HCC patients were enrolled and administrated with 600 mg b.i.d. Primary endpoints were TTP, secondary endpoints were safety, OS, and DCR. Local disease control was defined as no progressive disease (PD) by RECIST. Kaplan-Meier analysis was utilized for OS assessment.

In the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial (NCT01908426), C, an inhibitor of MET, VEGF receptors, and AXL, improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with P in pts with previously-treated advanced HCC. Overall, median OS was 10.2 mo for C vs 8.0 mo for P (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.92; p = 0.0049), and median PFS was 5.2 mo for C vs 1.9 mo for P (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.36- 0.52; p < 0.0001). Here, we evaluate clinical outcomes based on age in the CELESTIAL trial. Methods: 707 pts were randomized 2:1 to receive C (60 mg qd) or P. Eligible pts had pathologic diagnosis of HCC, Child-Pugh score A, ECOG PS ≤1, and must have received prior sorafenib. Randomization was stratified by disease etiology, geographic region, and extent of disease. Outcomes were analyzed for subgroups based on age ( < 65 years and ≥65 years). Results: Median age at baseline was 64 years; 51% of pts were < 65 years old. Etiology of HBV was more frequent in pts < 65 years vs ≥65 years old (52% vs 22%), while etiology of HCV occurred at a similar frequency in both age groups (24%). Asian race and enrollment in Asia were more frequent in pts < 65 years vs ≥65 years old (46% vs 21% Asian race; 35% vs 14% enrolled in Asia). Median OS was 9.6 mo for C vs 7.7 mo for P (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.62-1.05) for pts < 65 years old and 11.1 mo for C vs 8.3 mo for P (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56- 0.97) for pts ≥65 years old. Median PFS was 5.0 mo for C vs 1.9 mo for P (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.35-0.57) for pts < 65 years old and 5.4 mo for C vs 2.0 mo for P (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35-0.59) for pts ≥65 years old. The discontinuation rate due to treatment-related adverse events in the C group was lower in pts < 65 years vs ≥65 years old (11% vs 22%), while the percentage of pts with any dose reduction (61% vs 64%) and the median average daily dose of C (37 mg vs 34 mg) were similar in both age groups. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events in both age groups were consistent with those in the overall population.

Methods: HRQoL collected in a multicenter, randomized, openlabel, Phase 3 study compared first-line systemic treatment lenvatinib (LEN) to sorafenib (SOR) in unresectable HCC, were evaluated descriptively. Key QoL outcomes for patients progressing ≤3 months v > 3 months were modeled longitudinally and summarized using area under (AUC) the time curve analyses. The difference in AUC was calculated with contrasting domain parameter estimates of a mixed model with time, group, time∗group, and a random intercept at baseline and Day 1 each cycle through Cycle 18. Results: 954 patients were randomized to LEN (N = 478) or SOR (N = 476). Trial outcomes: median OS LEN (13.6 mos) v SOR (12.3 mos), HR 0.92; 95% CI, 0.79-1.06; median PFS 7.4 v 3.7 mos, respectively (HR 0.66; 95% CI, 0.57-0.77; P < 0.0001). Baseline HRQoL outcomes (e.g. EORTC QLQ-C30, HCC18, and EQ-5D) were markedly worse across most domains for patients who progressed earlier on treatment for both LEN and SOR arms (EQ-5D health utility index = 0.82 and 0.84 (respectively; ≤ 3 months) v 0.88 and 0.86 (respectively; > 3 months). The difference in AUC for EORTC QLQ-C30 role functional status was 0.1644 (95% CI = -0.2281, 0.5569; p-value = 0.4113) and for physical function was 0.0974 (95% CI = -0.3963,0.5911; p-value = 0.6989) favoring LEN. The difference HCC specific symptoms (HCC18) markedly favored LEN on sex life (dif = -0.4244), fatigue (dif = -0.1830), and nutrition (dif = -0.1522) and favored SOR on abdominal swelling (dif = 0.2021). Differences in symptoms related to jaundice, body image, and fever was minimal between treatment arms (dif ≤ 0.05). Conclusions: More patients experienced disease progression earlier on therapy with SOR compared to LEN. In our analysis baseline QoL was more severely impacted HCC patients who progress earlier while on therapy, suggesting that patients treated with LEN have an added benefit in terms of QoL as progression occurred later compared to SOR treated patients. Functional and symptom differences in QOL measures, while not statistically significant, also favored patients treated with LEN. (Table Presented).",,,,L625975123,10.1200/jco.2018.36.15_suppl.4093

Date of Publication: 1 May 2018","2018","36","15",,,"1 May 2018","Background: Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 70% of diagnosed HCC. Tislelizumab (also known as BGB-A317) is a humanized, IgG4 monoclonal antibody with high affinity and binding specificity for programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1). Furthermore, tislelizumab was specifically engineered to minimize F gR binding on macrophages, thereby abrogating antibodydependent phagocytosis, a potential mechanism of T-cell clearance. A first-in-human, phase 1A/1B study (NCT02407990) demonstrated that single-agent tislelizumab was generally well tolerated and showed evidence of antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors, including HCC. A recommended phase 3 dose of 200 mg administered intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) has been established for tislelizumab. Methods: This global, phase 3, randomized, multicenter, non-inferiority study (NCT03412773) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab compared with sorafenib as a first-line treatment of advanced HCC. Adult patients, aged ≥18 years, with unresectable, histologically confirmed HCC, an ECOG score ≤1, Child-Pugh A classification, BCLC Stage C disease or BCLC Stage B disease that has relapsed after loco-regional therapy, and who have not received prior systemic therapy, are being enrolled. Approximately 640 patients from 100 international centers will be randomized (1:1) to receive tislelizumab 200 mg IV Q3W or sorafenib 400 mg orally BID.

Date of Publication: 1 May 2018","2018","36","15",,,"1 May 2018","Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal disease with the highest mortality-to-incidence ratio of any solid tumor. The current standard of care for 1L treatment of patients (pts) with locally advanced or metastatic HCC is sorafenib (sor), a multikinase inhibitor. Single-agent treatment involving inhibition of PD-L1/PD-1 immune checkpoint or VEGF has shown modest activity in HCC. Evidence from a Phase I study (Stein ASCO 2018, submitted) in HCC supports a strong scientific rationale for combining atezolizumab (atezo; anti-PD-L1) with bevacizumab (bev; anti-VEGF) to achieve greater clinical benefit. In addition to its anti-angiogenic activity, bev may have immunomodulatory effects in the tumor microenvironment (increased DC maturation, enhanced T-cell infiltration, reduced MDSCs and Tregs in tumors) that can potentially increase the efficacy of atezo in inhibiting PD-L1/PD-1 signaling and restoring anti-tumor T-cell activity. Methods: IMbrave150 (YO40245) is a Phase III, open-label, multicenter, randomized study to evaluate atezo + bev vs sor in pts with locally advanced or metastatic and/or unresectable HCC. Eligible pts will be naive to prior systemic therapy for HCC, have ≥ 1 measurable untreated lesion (per RECIST v1.1), Child-Pugh class A liver function and ECOG PS 0/1.

Date of Publication: 1 May 2018","2018","36","15",,,"1 May 2018","Background: Thus far, sorafenib remains the standard of care for first line systemic therapy in patients with advanced HCC but patient prognosis and quality of life (QOL) continues to be poor. HCC may be responsive to immunotherapy due to higher expression of immunosuppressive cells and upregulation of CTLA-4 and PD-1 immune checkpoints (Gao et al 2009, Hato et al 2014, Pardee & Butterfield 2012). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are also associated with upregulation of regulatory T cells and PD-L1/PD-1 expression (Miroux et al 2010, Pardee & Butterfield 2012). Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 or CTLA4 immune checkpoints demonstrated clinical benefit in HCC as monotherapy. In preclinical studies, combination of anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies enhanced anti-tumour activity compared to monotherapy, indicating that the two pathways are non-redundant (Stewart, et al). Early clinical data from a phase I/II trial combining anti-PD-L1 and CTLA-4 (NCT02519348) demonstrated safety and a durable objective response rate (ORR) of 18%, prompting study expansion. Methods: HIMALAYA (NCT03298451) is the first randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of D+T combination therapy versus sorafenib in the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable, histologically-confirmed HCC.

Numerous responsive delivery systems which respond to both physiological and external stimuli have been reported in the literature. However, effective strategies incorporating a multifactorial approach are required to control these complex wounds. This can be achieved by fabricating spatiotemporal release systems, multimodal systems or dual/multi-stimuli responsive delivery systems loaded with one or more bioactive components.

Approval was based on the results of a single, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RESORCE) that demonstrated an improvement in overall survival (OS). Patients were randomly allocated to receive regorafenib160 mg orally once daily or matching placebo for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle.

The overall response rate, based on modified RECIST for HCC, was 11% in the regorafenib arm and 4% in the placebo arm. The toxicity profile was consistent with that observed in other indications; the most clinically significant adverse reactions were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, diarrhea, and hypertension. Based on the improvement in survival and acceptable toxicity, a favorable benefit-to-risk evaluation led to approval for treatment of patients with advanced HCC.

LTLD had been shown to be effective drug delivery method for hepatocellular carcinoma in animal models mouse tumor models compared with conventional free drug or non-Thermally sensitive liposome therapies. A recent phase III clinical trial (HEAT) compared survival of (a) radiofrequency ablation (RFA)-only and (b) LTLD administration together with RFA treatment patients (RFA+LTLD) but did not meet defined endpoints. This post hoc sub-Analysis aims to provide ranges of tumor properties, where RFA+LTLD patient survival is better than RFA-only patient survival using Cox proportional hazard model. Materials: HEAT study is a double-blind and randomized controlled phase III trial of RFA-only vs. RFA+LTLD in patients with 3-7 cm diameter hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although the trial included single as well as multiple tumor patients, we evaluated only patients with single tumors to normalize and simplify the study group and hypotheses (RFA only n = 210 vs. RFA+LTLD n = 227 patients). Tumor volume, longest diameter, area, ellipticity, one-month post ablation lesion volume, burn time, and burn time per tumor volume were investigated to find useful ranges for RFA+LTLD patients. Results: We found the ranges of different geometrical sizes, where LTLD was significantly different (useful) to the patients compared with RFA-only group (Table). Conclusions: LTLD may improve overall survival as RFA duration per unit tumor volume increases. This is a post hoc study in search of favorable ranges, therefore the results are not definitive and need to be confirmed with further studies.

Herein, we present the results from an investigator- initiated phase III trial that evaluated the effects of SOR+T in pts with aHCC. Method: Pts were randomly assigned (1:1) into one of two arms, to receive sorafenib with cTACE (Arm C) or without cTACE (Arm S) according to modified International Union Against Cancer tumor stage, extent of vascular invasion, Child-Pugh score and serum alpha fetoprotein level. All eligible pts received 800 mg sorafenib within 3 days (Arm S and C) and cTACE within 7-21 days after randomization, and repeating cTACE on demand (Arm C). The study continued until progression or unacceptable toxicities were observed. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints included time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response rate (TRR), and safety profile. Results: Between January 2013 and December 2015, 339 pts were enrolled from 13 hospitals in South Korea, and the last pt completed the trial on June 2017. Pts baseline characteristics were well balanced. For Arm C and S, respectively, median OS was 12.8 vs. 10.8 months (m) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-1.21; p = 0.290); median TTP was 5.3 vs. 3.5 m (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53-0.85; p = 0.003); median PFSwas 5.2 vs. 3.6m(HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.91; p = 0.01); TRR was 60.6% vs. 47.3% (p = 0.005). For Arm C and S, respectively, serious adverse events (AE) were 33.3% vs. 19.8% (p = 0.006), and grade ≥ 3 AE were increased alanine aminotransferase (20.3% vs. 3.6%), hyperbilirubinemia (11.8% vs. 3.0%), ascites (11.8% vs. 4.2%), thrombocytopenia (7.2% vs. 1.2%), anorexia (7.2% vs. 1.2%), hyponatremia (5.2% vs. 0%) (p < 0.05); handfoot skin reaction (10.5% vs. 11.4%), encephalopathy (5.2% vs. 1.2%) and diarrhea (5.2% vs. 4.2%). Subgroup analysis showed a survival benefit in pts (46.4%) of Arm C who received ≥2 cTACE sessions when compared to pts in Arm S (18.6 vs. 10.8 m; HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40-0.82; p = 0.006). Conclusion: SOR+T therapy did not improve OS versus sorafenib alone in pts with aHCC. However, SOR+T therapy significantly improved TTP, PFS, and TRR, and a survival benefit was observed in the pts who received SOR+T ≥2 cTACE sessions.",,,,L621858920,

The aim of this study is to identify baseline clinical features that influence survival in patients undergoing sorafenib treatment and thereby build a statistical model that predicts risk. Method:We had access to 1130 sorafenib patients from control arms of two phase III randomised clinical trials - RCT1 and RCT2 - as well as 364 non-trial sorafenib patients from Hong Kong, China. Model was built using RCT1 and validated on RCT2 and Hong Kong cohorts. Univariable and multivariable analyses were undertaken using flexible parametric survival models. Risk was stratified into four groups by identifying cut-points in the linear predictor of the training set, and subsequent model predictions were grouped according to this classification. Model performancewas assessed through Harrell's C statistic and comparison of observed and model-predicted survival curves and median survival times. Results: Baseline factors that influenced survival in the multivariable model were vascular invasion, ECOG, log(AFP), albumin, log(AST), aetiology, extra-hepatic spread and tumour number. In both RCT1 and the validation sets, the model-predicted survivalwas very similar to the observed survival (figure). The Harrell's C indices for RCT1, RCT2 and Hong Kong cohorts were 0.73, 0.70 and 0.69 respectively indicating good prediction. The corresponding predicted and observed median overall survival for the same cohorts were 8.8, 8.3, 4.8 and 9.2, 8.5, 4.4 months respectively. Conclusion: Model predicts survival similar to the observed. However, the model will require further validation on independent datasets. (Figure Presented).",,,,L621860154,

We aimed to compare overall survival in patients treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib as a first-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: This was an open-label, phase 3, multicentre, non-inferiority trial that recruited patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, who had not received treatment for advanced disease, at 154 sites in 20 countries throughout the Asia-Pacific, European, and North American regions. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice–web response system—with region; macroscopic portal vein invasion, extrahepatic spread, or both; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status; and bodyweight as stratification factors—to receive oral lenvatinib (12 mg/day for bodyweight ≥60 kg or 8 mg/day for bodyweight <60 kg) or sorafenib 400 mg twice-daily in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival, measured from the date of randomisation until the date of death from any cause. The efficacy analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle, and only patients who received treatment were included in the safety analysis. The non-inferiority margin was set at 1·08. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01761266. Findings: Between March 1, 2013 and July 30, 2015, 1492 patients were recruited. 954 eligible patients were randomly assigned to lenvatinib (n=478) or sorafenib (n=476). Median survival time for lenvatinib of 13·6 months (95% CI 12·1–14·9) was non-inferior to sorafenib (12·3 months, 10·4–13·9; hazard ratio 0·92, 95% CI 0·79–1·06), meeting criteria for non-inferiority. The most common any-grade adverse events were hypertension (201 [42%]), diarrhoea (184 [39%]), decreased appetite (162 [34%]), and decreased weight (147 [31%]) for lenvatinib, and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (249 [52%]), diarrhoea (220 [46%]), hypertension (144 [30%]), and decreased appetite (127 [27%]) for sorafenib. Interpretation: Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

Surgical resection followed by adjuvant and systemic chemotherapy are the most meticulously followed treatment procedures but the complex etiology and high metastatic potential of the disease renders surgical treatment futile in majority of the cases. Another hindrance to the scenario is the acquired resistance to drugs resulting in relapse of the disease. Hence, to provide insights into development of novel therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers, this review focuses on the various molecular mechanisms underlying chemoresistance in HCC. We have provided a comprehensive summary of the various strategies adopted by HCC cells, extending from apoptosis evasion, autophagy activation, drug expulsion to epigenetic transformation as modes of therapy resistance. The role of stem cells in imparting chemoresistance is also discussed. Furthermore, the review also focuses on how this knowledge might be exploited for the development of an effective, prospective therapy against HCC.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02541370, NCT02587689, NCT02723942, NCT02729493)",20180204976,,L621297814,10.1186/s12935-018-0538-7

Methods: Patients with unresectable HCC were randomized 1:1 to receive TACE with miriplatin or epirubicin in lipiodol. The primary endpoint was OS; secondary endpoints were percentages of patients who achieved treatment effect (TE) 4 (100% necrotizing effect or tumor reduction), duration of time to TACE failure, and adverse events (AEs). OS was compared using a stratified log-rank test adjusted for clinical stage, Child–Pugh class, and institution. Results: Of 257 patients enrolled from August 2008 to August 2010, 247 were analyzed for efficacy and toxicity (miriplatin, n = 124; epirubicin, n = 123). Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two groups. Median OS times were 1111 days for miriplatin and 1127 days for epirubicin (adjusted hazard ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.73–1.40, P = 0.946). TE4 rates were 44.4% for miriplatin and 37.4% for epirubicin. Median times to TACE failure were 365.5 days for miriplatin and 414.0 days for epirubicin.

This retrospective analysis explored whether HFSR with regorafenib was associated with OS in RESORCE. Methods: Pts in RESORCE who were randomized to regorafenib 160 mg/day during the first 3 weeks of each 4-week cycle were divided into subgroups based on whether or not they had HFSR. Estimates of OS (95% CI) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Pts who were randomized, but not treated, were included in the no HFSR group for the analysis of survival. Results: Of 379 pts randomized, 374 received at least one dose of regorafenib. Of the treated pts, 53% (n = 199) had HFSR of any grade and 13% (n = 47) had grade 3 HFSR. Among pts with HFSR at any time during the study, 77% (n = 153) had the first HFSR event (any grade) during Cycle 1.

Among 36 patients with a baseline AFP ≥ 5 ng/mL, 10 (28%) had a ≥ 50% drop in AFP. Low baseline plasma levels of sVEGFR1, VEGF-C, and bFGF and high levels of s-cMET and IL-12 tended to associate with longer TTP (p < 0.10). Decreased s-cMET at day 15 and decreased s-cMET and IL-2 at day 43 were associated with longer TTP (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Sorafenib+FOLFOX demonstrated encouraging clinical efficacy with moderate toxicity in the first line treatment of advanced HCC. Initial biomarker evaluation suggested a correlation between TTP and baseline angiogenic markers as well as changes in IL-2 and scMET.

This study was done to evaluate the efficacy of orantinib combined with conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (cTACE) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study was done at 75 sites in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, no extra-hepatic tumour spread, and Child-Pugh score of 6 or less were randomly assigned (1:1) by interactive web response system using a computer-generated sequence to receive orantinib or placebo, within 28 days of cTACE. Randomisation was stratified by region, Child-Pugh score (5 vs 6), alpha fetoprotein concentrations (<400 ng/mL vs ≥400 ng/mL), and size of the largest lesion (≤50 mm vs >50 mm). Orantinib at 200 mg, twice per day, or placebo was given orally until TACE failure or unacceptable toxicity. The patients, investigators, and study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed in the full analysis set (patients who had received at least one dose of study drug). This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01465464, and has been terminated. Findings Between Dec 10, 2010, and Nov 21, 2013, 889 patients were randomly assigned to receive either orantinib (445 patients; 444 treated) or placebo (444 patients; all treated). The study was ended at interim analysis for futility evaluation. Median follow-up was 17·3 months (IQR 11·3–26·4). There was no improvement in overall survival with orantinib compared with placebo (median 31·1 months [95% CI 26·5–34·5] vs 32·3 months [28·4–not reached]; hazard ratio 1·090, 95% CI 0·878–1·352; p=0·435). The main adverse events in the orantinib group were oedema, ascites, and elevation of aspartate and alanine aminotransferases. The most frequent adverse events of grade 3 or worse in the orantinib group included elevated aspartate aminotransferase (189 [43%] patients in the oratinib group, 161 [36%] patients in the placebo group), elevated alanine aminotransferase (150 [34%] patients in the oratinib group, 132 (30%) patients in the placebo group), and hypertension (47 [11%] patients in the oratinib group, 39 [9%] patients in the placebo group). Serious adverse events were reported in 200 (45%) patients in the orantinib group and 134 (30%) patients in the placebo group.

When heated to ≥40°C, LTLD locally releases a high concentration of doxorubicin. We aimed to determine whether adding LTLD improves the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions with a maximum diameter (d(max)) of 3 to 7 cm. Experimental Design: The HEAT Study was a randomized, double-blind, dummy-controlled trial of RFA ± LTLD. The 701 enrolled patients had to have ≤4 unresectable HCC lesions, at least one of which had a d(max) of 3 to 7 cm. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and a key secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Post hoc subset analyses investigated whether RFA duration was associated with efficacy. Results: The primary endpoint was not met; in intention-totreat analysis, the PFS HR of RFA + LTLD versus RFA alone was 0.96 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.79-1.18; P = 0.71], and the OS HR ratio was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.76-1.20; P = 0.67). Among 285 patients with a solitary HCC lesion who received ≥45 minutes RFA dwell time, the OS HR was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.41-0.96; P < 0.05) in favor of combination therapy. RFA + LTLD had reversible myelosuppression similar to free doxorubicin. Conclusions: Adding LTLD to RFA was safe but did not increase PFS or OS in the overall study population. However, consistent with LTLD's heat-based mechanism of action, subgroup analysis suggested that RFA + LTLD efficacy is improved when RFA dwell time for a solitary lesion ≥45 minutes.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00617981, NCT02112656)",,29018051,L620055648,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-2433

Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2018","2018","17","1",,,"1 Jan 2018","Background: LEN is an oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)1-3, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)1-4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor α, RET, and KIT. LEN was noninferior to sorafenib (SOR) in overall survival (OS) in a phase 3 study in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (medians: LEN, 13.6 vs SOR, 12.3 months; hazard ratio: 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.06) and statistically superior to SOR in progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and objective response rate (ORR). We previously reported that LEN showed antitumor activity in multiple HCC xenograft models including patient-derived xenograft (PDx) models. Here, we investigated the mode of action of LEN in preclinical human HCC models to examine antitumor angiogenesis activity in vivo and the effects on FGF signaling pathways both in vitro and in vivo in the preclinical HCC models. Methods: Antiproliferative activity of LEN and SOR was examined using human HCC cells (Hep 3B2.1-7, HuH-7, SNU398, and PLC/PRF/5) in vitro, and antitumor and anti-angiogenesis activity were examined using these HCC cell lines and PDx models. The effect on the FGF signaling pathway was evaluated by determining the phosphorylation of FRS2, a direct substrate of FGFRs, with immunoblotting analysis in both cultured cells and tumor xenografts. Anti-angiogenesis activity was evaluated by determining microvessel density (MVD) within tumor xenografts by immunohistochemical analysis using anti-CD31 antibody. Result: LEN decreased the phosphorylation of FRS2 in FGF19-overexpressing Hep3B2.1-7 and HuH-7 cells at 0.03 to 3 μmol/L in a concentration-dependent manner. LEN showed selective antiproliferative activity against these cells with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC ) values of 0.23 and 0.42 μmol/L, respectively, and those concentrations were consistent with ones for inhibitions of the phosphorylation of FRS2. In tumor xenografts, LEN also decreased the phosphorylation of FRS2 by the single administration of LEN between 3 and 30 mg/kg. SNU398 cells are known to have a relatively weak dependence on the FGF signaling pathway without FGF19 expression. LEN inhibited in vitro proliferation of SNU398 cells, and the phosphorylation of FRS2 both in vitro and in vivo at higher doses than in Hep 3B2.1-7 and HuH-7 cells. SOR did not selectively inhibit in vitro proliferation or the phosphorylation of FRS2 in HCC cells with FGF activation in vitro and in vivo. In HCC PDx and PLC/PRF/5 xenograft models, LEN significantly decreased the MVD in a dose-dependent manner between 3 and 30 mg/kg, and it was correlated with tumor growth inhibition in each models. SOR showed clear anti-angiogenesis activity at 30 mg/kg, but not at 10 mg/kg. Conclusion: These results suggest that inhibition of the FGF signaling pathway via FGFR with LEN affects proliferation of HCC cells with activation of the FGF signaling pathway, and the potent anti-angiogenic activity underlies the antitumor activity of LEN in preclinical HCC xenograft models.",,,,L620384350,10.1158/1535-7163.TARG-17-B095
"Endoglin antibody therapy produces the small vessel manifestations of HHT-1 and is associated with clinical activity when dosed with inhibitors of the VEGF pathway","Charles T.","Angiogenesis (2018) 21:1 (123). Date of Publication: 2018","2018","21","1","123",,"2018","Methods: TRC105 is an endoglin antibody being studied in three randomized clinical trials of advanced cancer patients: Phase 3 in angiosarcoma (AS), Phase 2 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and Phase 2 in glioblastoma (GBM), each with a primary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS), as well as single arm Phase 2 trials in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), each with a primary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR). TRC105 has been administered to more than 400 cancer patients as a single agent or in combination with VEGF inhibitors (e. g., bevacizmab, axitinib, pazopanib and sorafenib). Combination treatment with VEGF inhibitors has been the focus of clinical development, as VEGF up-regulation was observed following TRC105 single agent treatment and endoglin up-regulation is observed following VEGF inhibitor treatment. Results: TRC105 has a side effect profile that is consistent with the small vessel manifestations of HHT type 1 (HHT-1), a genetic syndrome caused by endoglin heterozygosity that results in endoglin haploinsufficency. Patients treated with TRC105 develop mucocutaneous telangiectasia that causes one or more signs and symptoms of HHT-1, including epistaxis, gingival bleeding and cutaneous telangiectasia, within the initial month of dosing. The development of mucocutaneous telangiectasia in unaffected by whether TRC105 is dosed as a single agent or dosed with a VEGF inhibitor. Separate trials of TRC105 and VEGF inhibitors have demonstrated signs of activity beyond that expected with the companion VEGF inhibitor: PFS in a single arm trial of TRC105 + axitinib was 11.3 months compared to PFS of 4.8 months in a separate trial of axitinib in RCC patients; ORR in a trial of HCC patients treated with TRC105 + sorafenib was 23% compared to ORR of 2% in a separate trial of sorefenib in HCC patients; ongoing durable complete responses have observed in trials of TRC105 + pazopanib in AS and of TRC105 + bevacizumab in GTN. Conclusion: TRC105 is an endoglin antibody that has on-target effects in cancer patients that mimic the small vessel manifestations of HHT-1. Importantly, HHT is associated with superior stage stratified cancer survival (Duarte et al., Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, 2013), and clinical trials indicate that targeting endoglin with TRC105 combined with VEGF inhibitor therapy is efficacious. Randomized clinical trials are ongoing in three oncology indications.

This therapy was well tolerated and achieved a high SVR rate (100%) in a Japanese Phase III trial. However, the patients were younger than real-world patients, and the proportion of patients with cirrhosis, or chronic renal disease was small. Furthermore, patients with history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment was excluded. The present study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir for elderly patients and to clarify whether extremely high sustained virological response (SVR) rate can be achieved even in a real-world setting. Method: This was a multicenter prospective cohort study. Exclusion criteria were any of followings: 1) being infected with other genotypes other than genotype 1, 2) treatment failure of daclatasvir and asunaprevir, 3) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ml/min/1.73 m(2)\30, 4) decompensated cirrhosis, 5) any form of cancer. Between September 2015 and February 2017, 424 patients were treated by standard doses of sofosbuvir (400 mg/day) and ledipasvir (90 mg/day) for 12 weeks. As 2 patients was lost to follow-up, 422 patients were finally analyzed. The negativity of HCV-RNA at week 12 after the end of therapy was defined as SVR. Result: Mean age was 68±12 years old. There were 219 male and 203 female patients. The SVR rates of overall, patients\65 years, patients C 65 and\75 years, and patients C 75 years were 97% (411/422), 97% (130/132), 96% (155/161), and 98% (126/129), respectively. The SVR rates of ineligible patients to interferon, cirrhotic patients, elderly (C 65 years old) and cirrhotic patients, patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (eGFR\60), patients with treatment failure of ribavirin and interferon, patients with history of HCC treatment, patients with protease inhibitor failure, and patients with resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) to non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) were 97% (355/366), 97% (184/190), 96% (147/153), 98% (91/93), 98% (89/91), 95% (78/82), 93% (43/46), and 93% (37/40), respectively. No significant difference was seen in SVR rate of each factor. Four patients (1%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Most frequently adverse effect was elevation of serum uric acid level (14%; 58/422). No significant difference was seen in safety between patients\75 years and patient C 75 years groups. Conclusion: In a real-world setting, sofosbuvir and ledipasvir was a safe treatment even in patients aged C 75 years. When patients without pre-existing NS5A RASs and prior protease inhibitor failure would be selected, extremely high SVR rate can be achieved irrespective of age.",,,,L621419067,10.1007/s12072-018-9852-3

We present a novel correlation of AFP response to radiologic response and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) and Sorafenib therapies. Method: Participants from a phase III multicenter randomized trial of SIRT versus Sorafenib in HCC were studied. Thirty five patients with HCC were treated with selective internal radiation therapy or Sor-afenib at our institution. Thirty one patients with baseline AFP higher than 20 ng/ml were studied for analysis. AFP response was defined as more than 50% decrease from baseline. Twenty six patients with follow-up imaging were studied for the AFP imaging correlation analysis. We studied the relationship between AFP response and treatment outcome in terms of radiologic response and overall survival. Result: Of 39 patients, 31 patients (79.4%) with elevated serum AFP ([20 ng/ml) and documented radiologic evaluation every 12 weeks. AFP response was seen in 3 (17.6%) of 17 and 6 (40%) of 15 of patients treated with Sorafenib and Selective internal radiation therapy, respectively (P=0.16).

Here, we present 12 month (M) results from the H2307 study (NCT01888432), conducted to determine whether EVR+rTAC provides similar beneficial effects post-LT in de novo living donor (LD) LT recipients. Method: In this 24M, multicenter, open-label, phase III, controlled study, recipients of LDLT were randomized to EVR (trough levels [C0]: 3-8 ng/mL) + rTAC (C0: 3-5 ng/mL; N = 142) or TAC-C (C0: 8-12 ng/mL from Week [W] 5 to M4 and C0: 6-10 ng/mL from M4 to M24; N = 142) ± corticosteroids after a run-in period of 30±5 days post-LT. Primary objective was to demonstrate comparable efficacy of EVR+rTAC and TAC-C (composite of treated biopsy-proven acute rejection [tBPAR], graft loss, or death) at M12 post-LT. Secondary objective was to at least demonstrate comparable renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) in EVR+rTAC and TAC-C arms from randomization (RND) to M12. Other objectives were safety and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence. Result: Of 284 patients, 92.3% (n = 131) in EVR+rTAC and 93.7% (n = 133) in TAC-C arm completed the 12M study. Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the arms. At M12, incidence of composite efficacy failure was comparable in EVR+rTAC vs TAC-C arms; EVR+rTAC arm was non-inferior (NI) to TAC-C arm (P < 0.001; Table 1). Moderate or severe episodes of tBPAR occurred only in TAC-C arm. Mean change in eGFR from RND to M12 in EVR+rTAC and TAC-C arms were-7.9 and-12.1 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. The eGFR was higher in EVR+rTAC vs TAC-C arms at all visits from W6 to M12; EVR+rTAC arm was NI (NI margin:-6 mL/min/1.73 m2; P < 0.001, 90% CI:-0.09, 8.40), but not superior (P = 0.108) to TAC-C arm at M12. Using imputation for missing eGFR data, mean change in eGFR was in favor of EVR+rTAC vs TAC-C arm (-8.0 vs-13.3 mL/min/1.73 m2) with a difference of 5.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 (P = 0.046). Incidence of adverse events (AE) and serious AE was comparable between the arms (Table 2). Most frequent AE leading to study drug discontinuation was proteinuria in EVR+rTAC (2.1%) and increased blood creatinine level in TAC-C arm (2.8%). Of 118 patients with HCC, recurrence was seen only in TAC-C arm (5/62, 8.1%). One hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence and one HBV de novo infection occurred in EVR+rTAC and TAC-C arms, respectively. Conclusion: In LDLT, early introduction of EVR+rTAC at 30±5 days post-LT demonstrated comparable efficacy and better renal function to TAC-C at M12. No new safety signal was reported in EVR+rTAC arm. No HCC recurrence was reported in EVR+rTAC arm, whereas 5 patients in TAC-C arm experienced HCC recurrence. M24 follow-up results will better define these findings.

Till the near past, pegylated interferon was the standard of care therapy. However, it was associated with suboptimal success rates and many side effects. Thereafter, direct antiviral agents (DAA) appeared and played the key role in management of HCV. One of those recent DAAs is ravidasvir. Summary: It is a potent NS5A inhibitor that was formerly known as PPI-668. It is produced by the cooperation of Presidio pharmaceuticals and Pharco International pharmaceutical company. Since its first production, it has been enrolled in different successive clinical trials. Phase 1 and 2 trials confirmed its safety and tolerability and its great efficacy in suppressing viral loads in short periods. It has a pangenotypic activity with favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Ravidasvir inhibits the replication of HCV variants that develop resistance mutations for different DAA classes. Even more, HCV variants that had reduced susceptibility to ravidasvir are completely susceptible to other DAA. Finally, a large multicenteric registrational phase 3 clinical trial that included large percentages of difficult to treat patients (such as cirrhotic and interferon experienced patients) has been fully accomplished and proved great SVR12 rates.

Date of Publication: 2018","2018","27",,"24","25","2018","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer globally and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide (World Cancer Research Fund International). Hepatocellular carcinoma is the complication of chronic liver diseases and usually develops within liver cirrhosis related to different etiologies. In Asia and Africa hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) with or without aflatoxin B1 exposure, is the most frequent etiology, whereas hepatitis C virus infection (HCV), chronic alcohol abuse and metabolic syndrome are most frequently related to HCC in Western countries. Because more than 90% of liver cancers arise in patients with underlying cirrhosis, the treatment approach for HCC depends on the stage and extent of the disease, the severity of the underlying liver disease and the overall performance status of the patient. Treatment consists of four strategies: 1. surgery (resection and liver transplantation); 2. locoregional procedures (ablation and transarterial embolization); 3. systemic therapies, and 4. best supportive care (BSC). For patients with early-stage tumors, surgical treatment or ablation can be curative. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) can be offered to patients with intermediate stage HCC no longer amenable to cure. Systemic therapy is reserved for patients with advanced or unresectable disease. For the past decade (since 2007) the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sorafenib was the only available standard of care for systemic treatment of advanced HCC. In a phase 3 trial, lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in patients with untreated advanced HCC. The safety and tolerability profiles of lenvatinib were consistent with those previously observed. In April 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved regorafenib for the patients with HCC who had been treated with sorafenib and showed progress after treatment with first-line sorafenib. In a phase 3 trial (RESORCE), regorafenib significantly improved overall survival vs placebo. Cabozantinib is a dual inhibitor of MET/VEGFR2 in tumors that has been shown in the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial to prolong overall survival in patients with advanced HCC. Despite these recent phase three trials, which introduced new antiangiogenic therapies in both, first line i.e. lenvatinib and second line treatment i.e. regorafenib and cabozantinib, HCC is in need for additional molecular treatments in first- and second-line therapy and also in the adjuvant setting. New data from international multi-centric genome sequencing projects are suggesting further promising therapeutic targets. For individualized patient care, genomic alterations identified in targetable genes will be useful to identify patients with HCC who could benefit from specific targeted therapies in clinical trials. Another category of agents that will provide new future treatment options are immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 antibodies, which kill cancer cells via a unique mechanism of action, involving immune responses. The indications for ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody), which were first approved for the treatment of malignant melanoma, are expanding. Clinical trials are currently ongoing to evaluate the utility of antibodies against programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) as monotherapy or combination therapy in patients with HCC. In May 2017, the FDA approved pembrolizumab for the treatment of any solid tumor confirmed to have high microsatellite instability or deficient mismatch repair. This is the first approval of a cancer treatment based on defined genetic alterations rather than the organ where the tumor originated. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 KEYNOTE-240 study compares efficacy and safety of the anti-programmed death 1 antibody pembrolizumab + BSC versus placebo + BSC in patients with previously treated advanced HCC. In view of the new options in the treatment of HCC combining targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors, adequate selection of a therapeutic strategy ideally based on specific biomarkers will become an important future challenge.",,,,L623188733,

Progress in the therapy of advanced HCC has come with the clinical development of sorafenib - a multikinase inhibitor of proliferation and angiogenesis. Multicenter, prospective, placebo-controlled phase III trial SHARP was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sorafenib administration in advanced HCC. In 2008 final analysis of SHARP trial has shown that sorafenib improved overall survival (OS) of patients in comparison with placebo (median OS 10.7 vs. 7.9 months, HR = 0.69, p < 0.001). Median time to progression (TTP) was longer and disease control rate (DCR) was also higher in sorafenib arm (TTP 5.5 vs. 2.8 months, p < 0.001 and DCR 43% vs. 32%, p = 0.002, respectively). The total incidence of serious adverse events was similar in both arms (52% vs. 54%), however in sorafenib group the following G3/G4 adverse episodes were significantly more frequent: weight loss (2% vs. 0%), diarrhea (8% vs. 2%), and hand-foot skin reaction (8% vs. 1%). Since then sorafenib has become a new standard for the treatment of advanced/metastatic HCC, and has served as a reference regimen for future clinical trials. In Poland the reimbursement from the National Health Fund does not include a treatment with sorafenib of HCC patients with extrahepatic dissemination. However, the SHARP study did not stratify patients due to the presence or absence of cancer spread outside the liver. In a situation where the study was not designed for patients with dissemination outside the liver and was discontinued before termination, it can't be unequivocally stated that the lack of statistical significance indicates a lack of efficacy of sorafenib therapy. In 2012 Bruix et al. found that sorafenib consistently improved the median OS and DCR compared to placebo in patients with advanced HCC, regardless of: etiology of cancer, baseline tumor burden, performance status, cancer advancement and prior therapy.",,,,L626579095,

Hepatocellular carcinoma is the complication of chronic liver diseases and usually develops within liver cirrhosis related to different etiologies. In Asia and Africa hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) with or without aflatoxin B1 exposure, is the most frequent etiology, whereas hepatitis C virus infection (HCV), chronic alcohol abuse and metabolic syndrome are most frequently related to HCC in Western countries. Because more than 90% of liver cancers arise in patients with underlying cirrhosis, the treatment approach for HCC depends on the stage and extent of the disease, the severity of the underlying liver disease and the overall performance status of the patient. Treatment consists of four strategies: 1. surgery (resection and liver transplantation); 2. locoregional procedures (ablation and transarterial embolization); 3. systemic therapies, and 4. best supportive care (BSC). For patients with early-stage tumors, surgical treatment or ablation can be curative. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) can be offered to patients with intermediate stage HCC no longer amenable to cure. Systemic therapy is reserved for patients with advanced or unresectable disease.

Despite the increasing knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic carcinogenesis, effective therapeutic strategies are still an unmet clinical need. Efforts have been made to develop selective drugs as well as effective targeted drug delivery systems. The development of novel drug carriers for therapeutic molecules can indeed offer a valuable strategy to ameliorate the efficacy of HCC treatment. In this review, we discuss recent drug delivery strategies for HCC treatment based on the exploitation of targeted nanoparticles (NPs). Indeed, a few of these platforms have achieved an advanced stage of preclinical development. Here, we review the most promising drug nanovehicles based on both synthetic and natural polymers, including polysaccharides that have emerged for their biocompatibility and biodegradability. To maximize site-selectivity and therapeutic efficacy, drug delivery systems should be functionalized with ligands which can specifically recognize and bind targets expressed by HCC, namely cell membrane associated antigens, receptors or biotransporters. Cell surface and intracellular molecular targets are exploited either to selectively deliver drug-loaded nanovehicles or to design novel selective therapeutics. In conclusion, the combination of novel and safe drug delivery strategies based on site-specific targeted drug nanovehicles with therapeutic molecular targets may significantly improve the pharmacological efficacy for the treatment of HCC.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01287585)",,29051062,L618882148,10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.10.027

Seventy (80.5%) of the 87 enrolled patients completed the study during the 52-week study period. Hepabulin (10,000 units) was intravenously injected intraoperatively, daily for 1 week, weekly for 1 month, and then once per month. Hepabulin was used as monotherapy without antiviral agents. Hepatitis B recurrence was defined as conversion from negativity for surface antigen after HBIG administration to positivity. Results: There were no cases of hepatitis B recurrence during the 52-week observation period. A total of 876 adverse events (AEs) that occurred during the study period were observed in 83 (95.4%) of 87 patients, and serious AEs were seen in 119 cases in 44 (50.6%) of the 87 patients. None of the AEs showed a relationship with this drug. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) rapidly disappeared within 1 week after HBIG administration, but hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA persisted for up to 8 weeks after surgery, which was related to HBV viral load.

We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib to that of selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) with yttrium-90 ((90)Y) resin microspheres in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods SARAH was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, investigator-initiated, phase 3 trial done at 25 centres specialising in liver diseases in France. Patients were eligible if they were aged at least 18 years with a life expectancy greater than 3 months, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, Child-Pugh liver function class A or B score of 7 or lower, and locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] stage C), or new hepatocellular carcinoma not eligible for surgical resection, liver transplantation, or thermal ablation after a previously cured hepatocellular carcinoma (cured by surgery or thermoablative therapy), or hepatocellular carcinoma with two unsuccessful rounds of transarterial chemoembolisation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a permutated block method with block sizes two and four to receive continuous oral sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) or SIRT with (90)Y-loaded resin microspheres 2–5 weeks after randomisation. Patients were stratified according to randomising centre, ECOG performance status, previous transarterial chemoembolisation, and presence of macroscopic vascular invasion. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population; safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of sorafenib or underwent at least one of the SIRT work-up exams. This study has been completed and the final results are reported here. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01482442. Findings Between Dec 5, 2011, and March 12, 2015, 467 patients were randomly assigned; after eight patients withdrew consent, 237 were assigned to SIRT and 222 to sorafenib. In the SIRT group, 53 (22%) of 237 patients did not receive SIRT; 26 (49%) of these 53 patients were treated with sorafenib. Median follow-up was 27·9 months (IQR 21·9–33·6) in the SIRT group and 28·1 months (20·0–35·3) in the sorafenib group. Median overall survival was 8·0 months (95% CI 6·7–9·9) in the SIRT group versus 9·9 months (8·7–11·4) in the sorafenib group (hazard ratio 1·15 [95% CI 0·94–1·41] for SIRT vs sorafenib; p=0·18). In the safety population, at least one serious adverse event was reported in 174 (77%) of 226 patients in the SIRT group and in 176 (82%) of 216 in the sorafenib group. The most frequent grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (20 [9%] vs 41 [19%]), liver dysfunction (25 [11%] vs 27 [13%]), increased laboratory liver values (20 [9%] vs 16 [7%]), haematological abnormalities (23 [10%] vs 30 [14%]), diarrhoea (three [1%] vs 30 [14%]), abdominal pain (six [3%] vs 14 [6%]), increased creatinine (four [2%] vs 12 [6%]), and hand-foot skin reaction (one [<1%] vs 12 [6%]). 19 deaths in the SIRT group and 12 in the sorafenib group were deemed to be treatment related.

Methods Exposure–response (ER) analyses for regorafenib were performed using data from a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RESORCE). Patients received 160 mg regorafenib or placebo once daily (3 weeks on/1 week off in a 4-week cycle) with best supportive care until disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity. Kaplan–Meier analyses for overall survival (OS) and time-to-progression (TTP) were performed in which regorafenib-treated patients were grouped into four categories according to their estimated average exposure over 4 weeks in cycle 1. While this analysis primarily focused on efficacy, a potential correlation between exposure and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was also evaluated. If any differences were observed between Kaplan–Meier plots, the ER analysis continued with a multivariate Cox regression analysis to evaluate the correlation between exposure quartile categories and the efficacy and safety parameters while taking into consideration the effect of the predefined clinically relevant demographic and baseline covariates. The functional form of the ER relationship within the regorafenib treatment group was subsequently evaluated. Results Based on visual assessment of the Kaplan–Meier plots, no meaningful relationship between the exposure categories and TEAEs were observed, although median OS and TTP tended to be longer in the higher exposure categories. Further ER analyses, which considered the effects of predefined covariates and the different shapes of the ER relationship, focused on efficacy. The baseline risk factors Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥ 1, alpha-fetoprotein levels ≥ 400 ng/ml, and aspartate transaminase or alanine transaminase levels > 3 × upper limit of normal were significantly associated with OS (P < 0.01) and age was associated with TTP. A statistically significant difference was found for OS and TTP between patients receiving regorafenib compared with those receiving placebo in the multivariate ER analysis (P < 0.01) in favor of regorafenib. However, within the group of regorafenib-treated patients, the effect of regorafenib exposure on efficacy, either by estimating four effect sizes for each quartile, or by including a continuous linear or nonlinear relationship between individual exposure and efficacy, was not significant (P > 0.01) and relatively flat. This suggests that increasing regorafenib exposure would not result in a meaningful increase in OS or TTP. Conclusion After considering the baseline risk factors: ECOG performance status, alpha-fetoprotein levels, and hepatic function for OS and age for TTP, the ER analysis in regorafenib-treated patients showed similar efficacy over the entire predicted exposure range in RESORCE. This supports the selected regorafenib dose of 160 mg once daily (3 weeks on/1 week off in a 4-week cycle) in patients with intermediate or advanced HCC who have experienced disease progression on sorafenib.",,20170415776,28549676,L616693796,10.1016/j.ejps.2017.05.050

To assess prognostic factors for HCC and predictive factors of sorafenib benefit, we conducted a pooled exploratory analysis from these placebo-controlled phase III studies. Methods: To identify potential prognostic factors for OS, univariate and multivariate (MV) analyses were performed for baseline variables by Cox proportional hazards model. Hazard ratios (HRs) and median OS were evaluated across pooled subgroups. To assess factors predictive of sorafenib benefit, the interaction term between treatment for each subgroup was evaluated by Cox proportional hazard model. Results: In 827 patients (448 sorafenib; 379 placebo) analyzed, strong prognostic factors for poorer OS identified from MV analysis in both treatment arms were presence of macroscopic vascular invasion (MVI), high alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; ⩽ vs. >median [3.1]). Sorafenib OS benefit was consistently observed across all subgroups. Significantly greater OS sorafenib benefit vs. placebo was observed in patients without extrahepatic spread (EHS; HR, 0.55 vs. 0.84), with hepatitis C virus (HCV) (HR, 0.47 vs. 0.81), and a low NLR (HR, 0.59 vs. 0.84). Conclusions: In this exploratory analysis, presence of MVI, high AFP, and high NLR were prognostic factors of poorer OS. Sorafenib benefit was consistently observed irrespective of prognostic factors. Lack of EHS, HCV, and lower NLR were predictive of a greater OS benefit with sorafenib. Lay summary: This exploratory pooled analysis showed that treatment with sorafenib provides a survival benefit in all subgroups of patients with HCC; however, the magnitude of benefit is greater in patients with disease confined to the liver (without extrahepatic spread), or in those with hepatitis C virus, or a lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, an indicator of inflammation status.

The aim of this study was to review the relevant literature concerning the treatment of HCV genotype 3 patients with interferon-free regimens. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed/Medline, Embase and Web of Science electronic databases. Trials enrolling patients with chronic hepatitis C infection treated with DAAs with or without ribavirin were included. Two investigators independently evaluated the trials for inclusion criteria, risk of bias and data extraction. The primary outcome was sustained virological response (SVR). In total, 323 references were identified, and 29 met the inclusion criteria: 18 general clinical trials, three general observational studies, three studies in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and four studies in HIV–HCV-coinfected patients.

To provide a comprehensive indirect treatment comparison of efficacy and safety of novel drugs, a network meta-analysis (NMA) of phase III randomized controlled trials was performed. Methods: After pertinent literature search up to November 1, 2016, 6 studies were eligible for the analysis including 4,812 individual patients with advanced HCC: 2,454 received sorafenib, 577 received brivanib, 530 received sunitinib, 514 received linifanib, 358 received sorafenib + erlotinib and 379 received placebo. Frequentist NMA was used to compare treatments within a single analytical framework. Results: NMA showed that sorafenib alone, regardless of combination with erlotinib, and linifanib provide a significant survival advantage over placebo (p < 0.05) but without any significant difference between each other. Conversely, all regimens significantly ameliorate progression-free survival versus placebo (p < 0.05). The rank order of efficacy was: sorafenib ± erlotinib, linifanib, brivanib, sunitinib, and placebo. Sorafenib ± erlotinib was the regimen with the fewest number of adverse events that required discontinuation of treatment, whereas linifanib and brivanib resulted in the most adverse events. The risk-benefit summary identified one cluster of therapies with a similar balance between efficacy and safety which included sorafenib alone or in combination with erlotinib, having, at the same time, the highest efficacy and safety.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2017","2017","67","4","862","873","1 Oct 2017","Traditionally, obesity and its related diseases have been considered a problem in Western countries. However, in the past two decades, urbanisation in many Asian countries has led to a sedentary lifestyle and overnutrition, setting the stage for the epidemic of obesity. This article reviews the epidemiological trend of obesity in Asia, with special emphasis on the emerging condition of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Currently, the population prevalence of NAFLD in Asia is around 25%, like many Western countries. While hepatocellular carcinoma and end-stage liver disease secondary to NAFLD remain uncommon, a rising trend has emerged. Around 8–19% of Asians with body mass indexes less than 25 kg/m(2) are also found to have NAFLD, a condition often described as “lean” or “non-obese” NAFLD. Although this condition is generally less severe than that in more obese patients, steatohepatitis and fibrotic disease are well recognized. Central adiposity, insulin resistance and weight gain are major risk factors, and genetic predisposition, such as the PNPLA3 polymorphism appears to be more important in the development of NAFLD in the non-obese population. Lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of management for obesity and NAFLD, but few patients can achieve adequate weight reduction and even fewer can maintain the weight in the long run. While pharmacological agents have entered phase III development for steatohepatitis, Asian patients are under-represented in most drug trials. Future studies should define the optimal management of obesity and NAFLD in Asia.",,20170551703,28642059,L617606636,10.1016/j.jhep.2017.06.003

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of treatment strategies initiated at different stages of liver fibrosis on the cost-effectiveness of three antiviral combinations for Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1. Methods: We created a decision analytic model of HCV reflecting liver fibrosis progression to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alternative therapeutic strategies for Japanese patients with genotype 1 CHC with different fibrosis stages. We compared six strategies: treatment of patients with all fibrosis stages (TA), those initiated at four different liver fibrosis stages (F1S, F2S, F3S, F4S), and no treatment (NoRx). We examined three kinds of combination therapy with antiviral agents: sofosbuvir-ledipasvir (SOF/LDV), ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir(OPR), and daclatasvir-asunaprevir (DA). The proportion of initial liver fibrosis stages of the cohort was assumed to be the same as in a Phase III study of DA treatment for Japanese HCV patients. Results: On base case analysis, TA yielded the most effective result and the ICER against the second most effective strategy, F1S, fell below 1.4 million Japanese yen per QALY with all antiviral agent combinations. F2S followed F1S for effectiveness, and the ICER of F1S against F2S with the three combinations fell below 1.1 million Japanese yen per QALY. NoRx, F4S, and F3S had higher lifetime costs and were less effective compared with F2S with all antiviral agent combinations.

Here, we present efficacy data from the study. Results and Conclusions: 284 patients were randomized (mean 54 years, 72% male, 79% Asian, mean [SD] MELD score 14 [5.5]; 42% hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], 30% positive for hepatitis B virus). Mean TAC trough concentration at month 12 was 36% lower with EVR+rTAC than TAC-Control. The primary endpoint, a composite of graft loss (GL), death or treated biopsy-proven acute rejection (tBPAR) at month 12 post-Tx, was similar with EVR+rTAC or TAC-Control (n [Kaplan-Meier%]): primary endpoint 7 (5.1%) vs. 8 (5.8%). No GL occurred and patient survival was comparable in both groups. Although tBPAR rates were similar in EVR+rTAC [3 (2.2%)] and TAC-Control [5 (3.6%)], moderate or severe episodes occurred only with TAC-Control. Mean estimated GFR (eGFR, MDRD-4) was numerically higher with EVR+rTAC up to Month 12. HCC recurrence was seen only in 5 patients in TAC-Control group. Study drug withdrawal due to adverse events (AEs) was similar in both groups. Withdrawal was similar with EVR+rTAC or TAC-Control: 18 (12.7%) vs. 15 (10.6%). Early initiation of EVR+rTAC after LDLT demonstrated comparable efficacy and numerically better renal function at M12 compared to TAC-Control. HCC recurrence was not observed in the EVR+rTAC cohort but affected only TAC-Control patients, a finding that merits further investigation.",,,,L619082333,10.1111/tri.13064

Gemcitabine was the first drug to be shown in a phase III study to have survival benefit in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, and this drug was approved for the treatment of this cancer in Japan in the year 2001. It would be no exaggeration to say that after JSMO was established in the following year, there has been a gradual advent of new drugs for the treatment of this cancer, and pharmacotherapy for hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers has been progressing. As for the treatment of cancer of the pancreas, there had been no more than a demonstration of the non-inferiority of S1 (approved in 2006) and a slight additional advantage of erlotinib (approved in 2011), until the introduction, recently, of FOLFIRINOX (approved in 2013) and nab-paclitaxel (approved in 2014) + gemcitabine regimens, which have been demonstrated to provide noticeable survival prolongation. BRCAness and cancer stromal targeting therapy have also attracted increasing attention, and further progress in this area is anticipated. For the treatment of liver cancer, no new drugs have been licensed since the approval of sorafenib in 2009, although there appears to be promise for approval of regorafenib and lenvatinib in the near future, with several clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitors being currently in progress. Gemcitabine +cisplatin regimen is the only standard therapy at present for cancer of the biliary tract, yet druggable mutations have been discovered, so that effective development of drugs for the treatment of this disease, which is globally recognized as a rare cancer, needs to be pursued.

Furthermore, clinical trials of brivanib, everolimus, ramucirumab, tivantinib were conducted with the aim of developing second-line agents for patients unresponsive to or intolerant of sorafenib, but failed to show superiority to the placebo. However, because ramucirumab was highly effective in a group of patients with elevated serum alphafetoprotein (AFP), a phase III study of ramucirumab is currently underway in patients with serum AFP levels-400 ng/ml. Recently, positive results of lenvatinib and regorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) here been reported. They would be definitely the other standard of care agents. An antibody against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) has been gaining attention as an immune checkpoint inhibitor in recent years.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2017","2017","28",,"ix43",,"1 Oct 2017","Chemotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be categorized as systemic chemotherapy or hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). Sorafenib is acknowledged as a standard systemic chemotherapeutic agent for advanced HCC on the basis of the results of two pivotal randomized controlled trials which demonstrated its superiority over placebo. Recently, non-inferiority of lenvatinib to sorafenib in the first line and superiority of regorafenib to placebo in the second line have been demonstrated in terms of the overall survival. Furthermore, immuno-oncology agents have been introduced as promising agents for advanced HCC. Thus, various novel systemic agents are currently under development. On the other hand, HAIC is often used in Japan, as it is expected to be associated with a stronger antitumor effect and a lower incidence of systemic adverse reactions as compared to systemic chemotherapy. However, because no randomized controlled trials have yet established the survival advantage of HAIC, no consensus has been reached as to the standard treatment for advanced HCC. To elucidate the usefulness of HAIC, two randomized controlled trials of sorafenib plus HAIC with cisplatin vs. sorafenib alone and of sorafenib plus HAIC with 5-FU + cisplatin vs. sorafenib alone were conducted in Japan. The former phase II trial demonstrated the effectiveness, in terms of prolonging the overall survival, of sorafenib plus HAIC with cisplatin as compared to sorafenib alone in patients with advanced HCC, whereas the latter phase III trial failed to show prolongation of survival in patients receiving sorafenib plus HAIC with 5-FU and cisplatin as compared to those receiving sorafenib alone. The role of HAIC, therefore, remains to be clarified in patients with advanced HCC. Further studies are needed to clarify the best treatment strategy for advanced HCC: use of molecular-targeted agents or HAIC, or both.",,,,L619368742,10.1093/annonc/mdx590

Data regarding its tolerance and adverse event profile in Indian patients is scarce. Materials and Methods: The primary aim of this analysis was to assess the adverse events (Grade 3 and Grade 4 as per CTCAE v4.0) and requirements for dose reduction with sorafenib in advanced HCC. Details of consecutive patients started on 800 mg/day dosing were obtained from a prospectively maintained database (over a period of 6 months) and analyzed. Results: Thirty-nine patients were available for inclusion in the study. Median age was 58 years (range: 20-75). All patients were classified as Barcelona clinic liver cancer C. Common side effects seen were liver dysfunction (38.5%), hand-foot-syndrome-rash (HFSR) (Grade 2 and 3-25.6%), fatigue (Grade 2 and Grade 3-10.3%), and diarrhea (7.7%). Dose reduction was required in 43.6% of patients. Drug interruptions/cessation was required in 38.5% of patients within the first four months of treatment. Nearly 41% of patients required cessation of sorafenib due to intolerable side-effects while 28.2% stopped sorafenib due to progressive disease. At a median follow-up of 4.9 months, median event-free survival (EFS) was 4.20 months (95% confidence interval: 3.343-5.068). Conclusion: A higher incidence of liver dysfunction and HFSR is seen in Indian patients as compared to published data. A significant proportion of patients required cessation of sorafenib due to adverse events in our series.

Today, it is well accepted that cells at the tumor microenvironment (TME) contribute in many ways to cancer development and progression. Tumor-homing peptide-decorated nanomedicines can interact specifically with surface receptors expressed on cells in the TME, improve cellular uptake of nanomedicines by target cells, and impair tumor growth and progression. Moreover, peptide ligand-modified nanomedicines can potentially accumulate in the target tissue at higher concentrations than would small conjugates, thus increasing overall target tissue exposure to the therapeutic agent, enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce side effects. This review describes the most studied peptide ligands aimed at targeting cells in the TME, discusses major obstacles and principles in the design of ligands for drug targeting and provides an overview of homing peptides in ligand-targeted nanomedicines that are currently in development for cancer therapy and diagnosis.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00483093)",20170464558,28506743,L617020687,10.1016/j.addr.2017.05.006

Pooled data from phase 1 studies in healthy adults and in subjects with mixed tumor types, and from study 202 in subjects with HCC, were analyzed using a population pharmacokinetic approach. The relationship between treatment-emergent adverse events leading to withdrawal or dose reduction during cycle 1 and lenvatinib exposure was explored by logistic regression analysis. A receiver operating characteristics analysis was used to investigate the best cutoff values of lenvatinib exposure and body weight to identify a high-risk group for early dose modification. The final pharmacokinetic model included body-weight effects on apparent clearance and volume. The relationship between the lenvatinib area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) at steady state and body weight demonstrated an increase in AUC as body weight decreased in subjects with HCC. An exposure–response relationship was observed, with higher lenvatinib AUC and lower body weight resulting in earlier drug withdrawal or dose reduction. The best cutoff values for body weight and lenvatinib AUC were 57.8 kg and 2430 ng·h/mL, respectively, to predict the group at high risk for early drug withdrawal or dose reduction.

Expert commentary: Despite the many overenthusiastic original and opinion reports, we have critically reviewed available NGS studies, with focus on the challenges to achieve clinical implications. Based on the recommendations for valid identification of clinically crucial genetic alterations (GAs) by NGS, we propose NGS integration into appropriately designed clinical trials.

Previous phase II trial of muparfostat demonstrated good tolerability and favorable clinical response. Methods: This international multicenter clinical trial was conducted in Asia-Pacific region (Taiwan, Korea, China, and Hong-Kong) from 2011. A total of 520 HV-HCC patients after surgical resection were randomized (1:1) to receive injection of either muparfostat (160 mg/day, 4-days-on/3-days-off, 3-weeks-on/1-week-off) or placebo for 52 weeks and followed up for 96 weeks.

Results: Baseline patient demographics and characteristics were balanced between the treatment and placebo arms. All subjects completed the 52-week treatment. After interim analysis in 2014, the trial was concluded in 2015. The final intention-to-treat analysis (N=519) yielded a non-significant result (p>0.05) on DFS, not reaching the primary end point. Nevertheless, per-protocol analysis (N=423) revealed a possible positive protective effect in subgroup patients with microvascular invasion.

Methods: Baseline plasma samples were available from 499/573 pts. A total of 266 circulating proteins valid for analysis were quantified by a Luminex assay (Myriad RBM). The predictive and prognostic effects (HR and 95% CI) were evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model with protein levels measured as a continuous variable. The predictive effect was modeled as a protein-treatment interaction effect and subjected to Akaike information criterion (AIC)-based selection to assess its association with OS and TTP. Subgroup analysis was done on proteins identified as significant for OS and TTP to generate a patient-wise protein composite score. Results: The overall and biomarker cohorts were similar for demographic variables and outcomes. Five proteins were predictive for OS (Table), but were not prognostic; 47 were predictive for TTP (6 were prognostic) and included the 5 proteins predictive for OS. In general, the REG treatment benefit for OS was maintained in dichotomized, quartile, and STEPP subgroup analyses, with lower protein levels correlating with improved treatment benefit. However, composite scores integrating information across predictive proteins indicated that in a small group of pts (n=20 OS; n=8 TTP) a high protein concentration was associated with a reduced treatment effect. Conclusions: Although this exploratory analysis suggests that most pts with HCC derive benefit from REG treatment, multiple proteins were identified as potentially predictive for OS and TTP treatment benefit with REG.

Methods: A bootstrap approach was applied to simulate 10,000 trials of patients with advanced HCC from SHARP (N=602; NCT00105443) and AP (N=226; NCT00492752). RR was measured by investigator assessment per RECIST with SHARP-BCLC amendments (Reig et al. Semin Liver Dis 2014) prior to crossover of PBO subjects to SOR treatment. Pearson correlation was calculated between estimated median OS (mOS) and estimated median TTP (mTTP)/estimated RR for the SOR and PBO arms separately.

Results: The mean of mOS, mTTP, and RR from simulated trials was similar to that reported in SHARP and AP (Table). The correlation between mOS and mTTP was 0.270 for SOR and 0.218 for PBO in SHARP, and 0.315 for SOR and 0.258 for PBO in AP; the correlation of log-rank test statistics comparing SOR and PBO was 0.387 in SHARP and 0.581 in AP.

International Liver Congress 2017) has shown that there is no significant difference in overall survival between selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with Y-90 resin microspheres (SIRSpheres® ; Sirtex Medical, North Sydney, Australia) and sorafenib for patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C liver-limited or liver-predominant hepatocellular carcinoma. Y-90 resin microspheres are, however, safer and better tolerated by patients than sorafenib, as well as reducing costs, due to single administration and less frequent and severe side effects. Our aim was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of SIRT using Y-90 resin microspheres versus sorafenib for the treatment of patients with BCLC stage C hepatocellular carcinoma in the UK. Methods: A cost-minimisation model was built, with equal efficacy assumed between Y-90 resin microspheres and sorafenib. Adverse events data were collected from the Phase III SHARP trial for sorafenib (Llovet et al. N Engl J Med 2008;359:378-90) and from the ENRY study for Y-90 resin microspheres (Sangro et al. Hepatology 2011;54:868-78). Treatment costs were taken from standard UK sources and real-world data from a UK hospital; treatment and adverse events disutilities were taken from published literature. Inputs were validated by UK clinicians and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: SIRT using Y-90 resin microspheres is dominant versus sorafenib, providing greater quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a lower cost. Y-90 resin microspheres provide 0.0079 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0046-0.0111) more QALYs than sorafenib, while saving £8,909 (95% CI £3,257-£14,570).

This exploratory analysis evaluated the potential of circulating miRNA plasma biomarkers to predict the OS and TTP benefit with REG in RESORCE. Methods: Valid biomarker data were available for 343/573 patients. Expression levels of 750 plasmamiRNAs collected at baseline were quantified by qPCR. To be eligible, miRNAs had to bemeasurable on a continuous scale or dichotomized by pre-processing (present vs absent), and present in≥5% of patients (i.e. n≥18). The predictive and prognostic effects (HR and 95%CI) were evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model with miRNAs as continuous or dichotomized variables. A predictive effectwas modeled as an miRNA-treatment interaction effect and subjected to Akaike information criterion (AIC)-based selection to assess its association with OS and TTP. Results: Demographic covariates were generally similar in the overall RESORCE and miRNA biomarker cohorts, except the latter had a smaller proportion of Asian patients. Of the 750 miRNAs analyzed, 25 showed a multiplicity-adjusted prognostic effect (P≤0.05) for OS. Nine miRNAs showed a multiplicity-adjusted predictive effect (P≤0.05) for OS; 3 of the 9 predictive markers were also prognostic (Table). No miRNA was found to be predictive for TTP. Conclusions: This exploratory analysis suggests that multiple miRNAs may be potentially predictive for OS in patients treated with REG. The biological role of the miRNAs in HCC as well as their potential functional correlation to treatment benefit needs to be analyzed further.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2017","2017","28",,"v242",,"1 Sep 2017","Background: Combined use of sorafenib and local therapy for treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well established. Notably, most common cause of death inHCC is liver failure, therefore we tested the promise of controlling the local tumors even in the setting of advanced/metastatic disease to improve survival. Our study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of combined use of sorafenib and yttrium-90 resinmicrospheres (Y90 RMS) in unresectableHCC defined as BarcelonaClinic Liver Cancer class C. Methods: Between October 2013 and August 2016 we enrolled 40 advanced stage HCC patients, 38 patients were treated with sorafenib followed (after 4 weeks) with Y90 RMS atMDAnderson Cancer Center. Survival analysis was done to evaluate median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). We used modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) to assess response to treatment and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 to evaluate the grading of treatment related toxicity. Results: The majority of our patients were males (74%), white (47%), 66% of patients had underlying liver cirrhosis, 26% had vascular invasion, and 26% had extrahepatic disease. The estimated median OS and 95% confidence interval (CI) in months was 18.46 (12.29 - NA) and the estimated PFS was 12.29 months (5.72 - 18.79). Stable disease (SD) was observed in 44.74% of patients, while 28.95% achieved partial response (PR). Grade III-IV adverse events included fatigue (n=3), hyperbilirubinemia (n=2), thrombocytopenia (n=1), proteinuria (n=1), hyponatremia (n=1), elevated liver enzymes (n=4), hypertension (n=4), diarrhea (n=1), nausea (n=1) and vomiting (n=2). Conclusions: This is the first prospective study to evaluate sorafenib followed by Y90 in HCC. Our study included patients with metastatic HCC and showed that combined use of sorafenib and Y90 was tolerable and was associated with longerOS and PFS compared to previous studies which evaluated sorafenib alone. However, future randomized phase III studies are warranted to assess sorafenib+/-Y90 in metastatc disease setting.",,,,L619623970,10.1093/annonc/mdx369.093

We performed BM analyses to identify potential markers of benefit to each agent. Methods: 954 Pts with uHCC, untreated in first-line, were randomized 1:1 in this open-label study to oral LEN (weight≥ 60 kg: 12 mg/day;< 60 kg: 8 mg/day) or SOR 400 mg twice daily. Primary endpoint was OS. Archival tumor tissue and blood samples were collected pretreatment and at specified time points. The BM analysis set (BAS; n=119) included pts who provided both archival tissue and serum samples. Serum samples from 114 pts were analyzed at baseline and over time with ELISA or chemiluminescence for VEGF, ANG2, FGF21, FGF23, and PIVKA-II. Gene-expression profiling was performed on tissue samples with nCounterVR (NanoString). Results from BM analyses were correlated with OS. Results: Of 119 pts in the BAS, 58 tissues passed quality assurance. Clinical characteristics of the BAS were similar to the ITT except most pts in the BAS were from the West. For serum assays, 66 pts in the LEN arm and 48 pts in the SOR arm were analyzed. At baseline, there was a trend that lower VEGF, ANG2, and FGF21 serum levels were associated with better outcomes with both LEN and SOR. Data with FGF19 and FGF23 were not consistent. An increase in serum VEGF over time was seen with both drugs, but was greater for LEN. Only LEN showed modulation of ANG2, FGF19, and FGF23 levels. Gene-expression analysis was performed in 58 pts (34 LEN, 24 SOR). Supervised clustering using angiogenic and growth-factor pathway gene expression based on 36 genes identified 3 groups. Median OS was longer with LEN in pts with higher VEGFand FGF-family gene-expression levels but was longer with SOR in pts with lower expression levels. Conclusions: LEN was noninferior to SOR in OS in pts with uHCC. Serum BM and gene expression levels appear to correlate with outcomes in the BAS.

This Japanese study aimed to confirm the efficacy and safety of tivantinib in this population (NCT02029157). Methods: Main inclusion criteria were HCC patients refractory or intolerant to a prior sorafenib therapy, Child Pugh A, ECOG PS≥1, at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST 1.1, and diagnosed as c-Met high (regarded as≤2+ in≤50% of tumor cells, by IHC). Enrolled patients were blindly randomized to either tivantinib or placebo group in 2:1 ratio. Stratification factors were vascular invasion (Y/N) and ECOG PS (0/1). Tivantinib (120 mg bid) or placebo was orally administered until discontinuation criteria was met. Primary endpoint was PFS by the independent review committee, based on CT/MRI every 6 weeks. Secondary endpoints included OS and safety. A sample size of 160 patients and 136 PFS events were calculated to detect a HR of 0.6 (improvement in median PFS from 8 to 13.3 weeks), with 10% dropout, 80% power, and log-rank test with 5% two-sided alpha. Results: From 60 sites in Japan, 386 patients were consented, and 195 patients were randomized (tivantinib; n=134, placebo; n=61). As results, median PFS was 2.8 months in the tivantinib group, whereas 2.3 months in the placebo group (HR=0.72 [95% CI 0.51-1.02], p=0.065).

This Clinical Practice Guideline presents updated recommendations for the optimal management of HBV infection. Chronic HBV infection can be classified into five phases: (I) HBeAg-positive chronic infection, (II) HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis, (III) HBeAg-negative chronic infection, (IV) HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis and (V) HBsAg-negative phase. All patients with chronic HBV infection are at increased risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), depending on host and viral factors. The main goal of therapy is to improve survival and quality of life by preventing disease progression, and consequently HCC development. The induction of long-term suppression of HBV replication represents the main endpoint of current treatment strategies, while HBsAg loss is an optimal endpoint. The typical indication for treatment requires HBV DNA >2,000 IU/ml, elevated ALT and/or at least moderate histological lesions, while all cirrhotic patients with detectable HBV DNA should be treated. Additional indications include the prevention of mother to child transmission in pregnant women with high viremia and prevention of HBV reactivation in patients requiring immunosuppression or chemotherapy. The long-term administration of a potent nucleos(t)ide analogue with high barrier to resistance, i.e., entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide, represents the treatment of choice. Pegylated interferon-alfa treatment can also be considered in mild to moderate chronic hepatitis B patients. Combination therapies are not generally recommended. All patients should be monitored for risk of disease progression and HCC. Treated patients should be monitored for therapy response and adherence. HCC remains the major concern for treated chronic hepatitis B patients. Several subgroups of patients with HBV infection require specific focus. Future treatment strategies to achieve ‘cure’ of disease and new biomarkers are discussed.",,,28427875,L615431355,10.1016/j.jhep.2017.03.021

Methods Eligible patients had advanced HCC, Child-Pugh A, PS 0 or 1 and prior sorafenib. Patients received ramucirumab (8 mg/kg) or placebo (1:1) on day 1 of a 2-week cycle. QoL was assessed by FACT Hepatobiliary Symptom Index (FHSI)-8 and EuroQoL (EQ-5D) at baseline; cycles 4, 10, and 16; and end of treatment. PS was assessed at baseline, each cycle, and end of treatment. Deterioration in FHSI-8 was defined as a ≥3-point decrease from baseline and PS deterioration was defined as a change of ≥2. Both intention-to-treat and pre-specified subgroup of patients with baseline serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥400 ng/mL were assessed. Results There were 565 patients randomised to ramucirumab and placebo. Compliance with FHSI and EQ-5D was high and similar between groups. In the ITT population, deterioration in FHSI-8, EQ-5D, and PS was similar between ramucirumab and placebo. In patients with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL, ramucirumab significantly reduced deterioration in FHSI-8 at the end of treatment compared with placebo (P = 0.0381), and there was a trend towards a delay in the deterioration of symptoms in FHSI-8 (HR 0.690; P = 0.054) and PS (HR 0.642; P = 0.057) in favour of ramucirumab.

We aimed to determine whether TACE with sorafenib improves progression-free survival versus TACE with placebo. Methods We did a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (TACE 2) in 20 hospitals in the UK for patients with unresectable, liver-confined hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients were eligible if they were at least aged 18 years, had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less, and had Child-Pugh A liver disease. Patients were randomised 1:1 by computerised minimisation algorithm to continuous oral sorafenib (400 mg twice-daily) or matching placebo combined with TACE using drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE), which was given via the hepatic artery 2–5 weeks after randomisation and according to radiological response and patient tolerance thereafter. Patients were stratified according to randomising centre and serum α-fetoprotein concentration (<400 ng/mL and ≥400 ng/mL). Only the trial coordinator was unmasked to treatment allocation before patient progression during the study. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival defined as the interval between randomisation and progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause, and was analysed by intention-to-treat. Safety was analysed by intention-to-treat. The trial has been completed and the final results are reported. The trial is registered at EudraCT, number 2008-005073-36, and ISRCTN, number ISRCTN93375053. Findings Between Nov 4, 2010, and Dec 7, 2015, the trial enrolled 399 patients and was terminated after a planned interim futility analysis. 86 patients failed screening and 313 remaining patients were randomly assigned: 157 to sorafenib and 156 to placebo. The median daily dose was 660 mg (IQR 389·2–800·0) sorafenib versus 800 mg (758·2–800·0) placebo, and median duration of therapy was 120·0 days (IQR 43·0–266·0) for sorafenib versus 162·0 days (70·0–323·5) for placebo. There was no evidence of difference in progression-free survival between the sorafenib group and the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·99 [95% CI 0·77–1·27], p=0·94); median progression-free survival was 238·0 days (95% CI 221·0–281·0) in the sorafenib group and 235·0 days (209·0–322·0) in the placebo group. The most common grade 3–4 adverse events were fatigue (29 [18%] of 157 patients in the sorafenib group vs 21 [13%] of 156 patients in the placebo group), abdominal pain (20 [13%] vs 12 [8%]), diarrhoea (16 [10%] vs four [3%]), gastrointestinal disorders (18 [11%] vs 12 [8%]), and hand–foot skin reaction (12 [8%] and none). At least one serious adverse event was reported in 65 (41%) of 157 patients in the sorafenib group and 50 (32%) of 156 in the placebo group, and 181 serious adverse events were reported in total, 95 (52%) in the sorafenib group and 86 (48%) in the placebo group. Three deaths occurred in each group that were attributed to DEB-TACE. Four deaths were attributed to study drug; three in the sorafenib group and one in the placebo group. Interpretation The addition of sorafenib to DEB-TACE does not improve progression-free survival in European patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Alternative systemic therapies need to be assessed in combination with TACE to improve patient outcomes.

The traditional morphological criteria such as response evaluation criteria in solid tumor (RECIST) rely on changes in tumor size to determine treatment efficacy. However, these criteria based on tumor morphology may not be suitable to monitor response to newer targeted therapies as early functional changes induced by these drugs precede changes in tumor size. Modifications of these morphological criteria that determine response based on tumor enhancement characteristics such as modified RECIST (mRECIST) will potentially allow improved determination of treatment response pending validation from prospective trials. Advanced functional imaging techniques such as perfusion imaging (computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging [CT/MRI]), diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET/CT and PET/MRI) are being increasingly used as surrogate imaging biomarkers to provide superior assessment of changes in tumor physiology. Growing emphasis on precision oncological care tailored to specific tumor type and individual patients renders the use of these newer imaging modalities more pertinent and timely.

These techniques involve the delivery of a particular substance into the tumor via the arteries directed toward that tumor. Most frequently, a chemotherapeutic agent (often in the form of a drug-eluting bead or microsphere) is delivered in this fashion, in a process termed transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). TACE has been used for several decades. Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) has gained widespread use in the past 5 to 10 years.",,20170905974,29036038,L619966530,

For patients with early-stage tumors, surgical treatment or ablation can be curative. Patients with intermediate-stage disease can be candidates for embolization, administered as either transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or transarterial radioembolization (TARE). Systemic therapy is reserved for patients with advanced or unresectable disease. For the past decade, the multitargeted kinase inhibitor sorafenib has been the only agent approved for unresectable HCC. This approval was followed by several clinical trials investigating other multitargeted kinase inhibitors, but none showed any benefit over single-agent sorafenib. Most patients progress after treatment with first-line sorafenib. In April 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved regorafenib for patients with HCC who have been previously treated with sorafenib.

For early PLCs, complete surgical resection is the only effective treatment, with sorafenib and, more recently, regorafenib prolonging overall survival by a few months. Areas covered: Application of next-generation sequencing (NGS), including targeted NGS (tNGS), whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq), on clinical samples from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) could aid in comprehending tumorigenesis, genetic and genomic heterogeneity, as well as developing molecular classifications for specialized targeted therapy. Expert commentary: Despite the many overenthusiastic original and opinion reports, we have critically reviewed available NGS studies, with focus on the challenges to achieve clinical implications. Based on the recommendations for valid identification of clinically crucial genomic alterations (GAs) by NGS, we propose NGS integration into appropriately designed clinical trials.

Chemo-resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor cells can be mediated by several mechanisms including P-gp efflux pumps and drug sequestration by the autophagy process. This study investigates the potential of doxorubicin loaded nanoparticle (NP) to reverse chemo-resistance by these mechanisms compared to free doxorubicin. We present the preclinical evaluation of anti-tumor effects of NP as monotherapy and in combination with standard agents used in treatment of HCC, pancreatic and sarcoma cancers. A phase III clinical study comparing NP to Best Standard of Care (Relive study) in patients with advanced HCC is in the final stages of recruitment with preliminary results expected in 2H 2017. Methods. Tumor cell lines were incubated with drugs in cell proliferation assay. In vivo efficacy of NP alone (4-8 mg/kg) or in combination with current and investigational treatments for pancreatic cancer (e.g. Gemcitabine, Erlotinib, Abraxane) and HCC (Sorafenib, Regorafenib and Lenvatinib) were performed in mouse tumor models using tumor weight as primary endpoint. In all experiments NP was compared to administration of free doxorubicin. Doxorubicin quantification in tumor and organs to asses PK and biodistribution was also performed using an LC/MS based method. Autophagy was measured by cell proliferation in the presence of inhibitors e.g. Concanamycin A, Hydroxychloroquine sulfate added 30 min before incubation with the test compound. Results. NP showed a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in all resistant cancer cell lines tested with a superior activity compared to free doxorubicin and other tested drugs. In contrast to free doxorubicin, NP showed consistent anti-proliferative activity in the absence/presence of inhibitors of P-gp pumps and autophagy. In a range of in vivo models, NP was preferentially taken up by the tumor tissue and significantly reduced tumor growth when compared with free doxorubicin and with at least equivalent reduction in tumor growth compared to current treatments. Furthermore NP administered in combination with current treatments significantly increased the inhibitory effect of each drug without additional toxicity (as measured by no change in body weight). The results comparing efficacy of NP alone and in combination in HCC, pancreatic and sarcoma cancer models will be presented. Conclusions. These results demonstrate that NP is clearly differentiated from free doxorubicin, in 1) overcoming resistance mechanisms linked to efflux and autophagy, and 2) having a superior biodistribution profile both of which results in significantly enhanced activity on chemo-resistant tumors. NP also provides an opportunity to combine with other agents, enhancing activity without increasing toxicity. The implications of these results on the further development of NP will be discussed.",,,,L619155082,10.1158/1538-7445.AM2017-3076

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2017","2017","77","13",,,"1 Jul 2017","Plitidepsin, a cyclic depsipeptide of marine origin, has shown potent anticancer activity in preclinical assays and recently finished with positive results a pivotal phase III trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01102426) for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients. We have recently found that eukaryotic elongation factor 1A2 (eEF1A2), one of the two isoforms of the alpha subunit of eEF1, is the pharmacological target of plitidepsin. Although it shares 96% homology with eEF1A1 (the other isoform), they display an exclusive pattern of expression, being eEF1A2 solely expressed in brain and muscle in healthy individuals. However, it has been found that many tumors abnormally overexpress this protein, including multiple myeloma, prostate, pancreatic, ovarian, breast, lung and liver cancers. Furthermore, although eEF1A2 canonical function consists in the delivery of aminoacyl-tRNAs to the A site in the ribosome, it has been shown to have pro-oncogenic moonlighting activities, including inhibition of apoptosis, protein degradation by the proteasome, heat shock response, cytoskeleton organization and regulation of oxidative stress. We now investigated several of the pro-oncogenic activities of eEF1A2 to analyze the impact that plitidepsin could have preventing them. Indeed, we observed that plitidepsin interfered with the interaction between eEF1A2 and Peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), a complex that allosterically enhances the enzymatic activity of PRDX1. This way, plitidepsin would diminish PRDX1 antioxidant activity, possibly originating the oxidative stress that has been described in the bibliography as one of the first effects triggered by the drug in cancer cells. PRDX1 only interacts with the GDP-bound form of eEF1A2, while plitidepsin exclusively binds to the GTP-bound form, most probably sequestering this protein from the pool that could interact with and activate PRDX1. Furthermore, we have confirmed that eEF1A2 interacts with Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), a complex that has been described in the bibliography as having enhanced SPHK1 activity. SPHK1 phosphorylates sphingosine producing sphingosine-1-P, second messenger that binds to its receptors in the cell membrane and conveys growth and survival signals to the cell. We could see that plitidepsin treatment reduced the production of sphingosine-1-P in HeLa cells, destabilizing the equilibrium towards the pro-apoptotic ceramide/sphingosine side and promoting cell death. Thus, through its binding to eEF1A2, plitidepsin derails a series of its moonlighting functions that are essential for the survival of tumor cells, driving them into apoptosis.",,,,L619156060,10.1158/1538-7445.AM2017-1165

In India, HCV infection imposes a considerable burden of mortality, morbidity and healthcare costs. In the last two decades, the treatment of HCV has evolved from interferon (IFN)-based therapies with or without ribavirin (RBV) to pegylated-IFN (PEG-IFN) and RBV-based therapies that were better tolerated by patients. However, the introduction of oral drugs, which specifically target virus-specific proteins, has now revolutionized the treatment of chronic HCV. These agents are known as direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). These drugs have resulted in very high HCV cure rates even with reduced treatment duration and an excellent tolerability by the patients compared to PEG-IFN- and RBV-based therapies. In India, sofosbuvir (SOF), one of the most effective DAAs, has been made available at a compassionate price; thus only those DAA-based management strategies, which contain SOF are adopted in India. Here, we review different DAAs and their possible roles in different genotypes and stages of liver disease, stressing upon the role of SOF.

Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2017","2017","45",,"13",,"1 Jul 2017","Evidence-based management of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is key to their optimal care. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer algorithm is the most widely used staging system. Patients with single liver tumors or as many as 3 nodules <3 cm are classified as having very early or early-stage cancer and benefit from resection, transplantation, or ablation. Those with a greater tumor burden, confined to the liver, and who are free of symptoms are considered to have intermediate stage cancer and can benefit from chemoembolization if they still have preserved liver function. Those with symptoms of HCC and/or vascular invasion and/or extrahepatic cancer are considered to have advanced-stage cancer and could benefit from treatment with the kinase inhibitor sorafenib. Patients with end-stage HCC have advanced liver disease that is not suitable for transplantation and/or have intense symptoms. Studies now aim to identify molecular markers and imaging techniques that can detect patients with HCC at earlier stages and bett er predict their survival time and response to treatment. Sorafenib is now the standard systemic therapy for HCC. In a phase 3 SHARP trial performed in the West, sorafenib reduced patients' risk of death by 30% (median survival time of 10.7 months with sorafenib vs 7.9 months without). In a trial performed in the East, patients had shorter survival times because they entered the study with more advanced-stage HCC; median survival times were 6.5 months with sorafenib versus 4.2 months without. The magnitude of improvement was the same in each study, indicating that the drug is active in different populations. The most frequent adverse events are hand/food/skin reactions, asthenia, diarrhea, and arterial hypertension, the incidence of which is higher in Asian patients. Up to 30% of the patients have to discontinue treatment because of adverse events, but adverse events (all dermatological AE in first 60 days) correlate with a bett er outcome. Careful management of patients and appropriate dose adjustments are therefore needed. Sorafenib is the first treatment option for patients with HCC of BCLC stage C and for patients with HCC of BCLC stages A or B who are not candidates for curative or locoregional treatments due to treatment stage migration and/or untreatable progression because of tumor burden. Sorafenib improves overall survival of patients with HCC with the absence of objective responce. Thus, time to tumor progression (TTP) is used to capture benefits of novel molecular agents, but proof of its surrogacy with survival is lacking. This was the reason that treatment was continued beyond progression in the sorafenib trials with refinement of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

Several trials provide robust evidence of the survival achieved with radioembolization. However, the current data base is composed of retrospective and uncontrolled trials and in the case of prospective studies limited by small numbers. A consensus meeting to develop practice guidelines and to recommend future clinical trials for radiation therapy and selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) in HCC was held at the 5th annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Primary Liver Cancer Expert consortium. There was agreement that SIRT can be considered in patients with early, intermediate and advanced stage HCC [1]. Because of the lack of randomized phase III trials, studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of sequential combination of EBRT and SIRT were strongly recommended. Similarly, the European (EASL) and American (AASLD) societies have appreciated that there are signals of efficacy and a fair safety profile but uncertainties remain about its comparative effectiveness. Thus, SIRT cannot yet be recommended as standard therapy in patients with HCC. The existing data base provides preliminary data on outcome. Survival depends on BCLC stage and varies from 10 months in BCLC C to 24.4 months in BCLC A [2]. In addition, preliminary data exist comparing SIRT vs. TACE. Patients with HCC treated by chemoembolization or radioembolization with Yttrium-90 microspheres had similar survival times. Radioembolization may result in longer timeto- progression and less toxicity than chemoembolization [3]. In our Mainz series no significant differences were found in median PFS, OS, and TTP [4]. A lower rate of tumor progression in the SIRT group was nullified by a greater incidence of liver failure. An ongoing phase II trial (SORAMIC) compares radioembolization followed by sorafenib with sorafenib alone. Initial assessment suggests the combination to be as well tolerated as sorafenib alone [5].

"SBRT for HCC","Kimura T.","Liver Cancer (2017) 6 Supplement 1 (21). Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2017","2017","6",,"21",,"1 Jul 2017","Recently, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has been recognized as one of the treatment modalities for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several investigators have reported a 90%-100% three-year local control rate of SBRT for small tumors (≤3 cm) without an increase in severe adverse effects in patients with Child-Pugh score of ≤7. This excellent result suggested that SBRT could be a competitor of radiofrequency ablation (RFA). However, according to several guidelines, such as the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification (BCLC) and Japanese guidelines, resection and ablative therapies are the first choice for the treatment of early stage HCC. Radiotherapy, including SBRT or particle therapy, can be considered alternative treatment modalities for patients with HCC who were ineligible for resection or ablation therapies. The reasons are as follows: 1) Low evidence level. Although the level of evidence for RFA is 2A (Level 2, Non-randomized controlled clinical trials; A, the strength of evidence according to endpoints is total mortality), according to the BCLC, the level of evidence for external three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, including SBRT is 3A (Level 3, Case series; A, the strength of evidence according to endpoints is total mortality). There is no evidence to support SBRT for therapeutic management of HCC. 2) The lack of results on long-term survival. Several prospective trials have demonstrated that the 3-year overall survival (OS) of RFA is almost 60-70% and that of SBRT is almost 50-70%. The 5-year OS of RFA is almost 50-60%. However, there are no available data on SBRT. 3) Damage to the normal liver after SBRT is relatively higher than that after RFA. Therefore the ablative area is clear and limited with RFA, and damage to the normal liver is also limited. On the other hand, focal liver reaction in the area that receives moderate to high degree of irradiation on CT/MRI after SBRT. Moreover, the area surrounding the focal liver reaction on CT/MRI receives some amount of low to moderate dose of irradiation; implying that damage to the normal liver tissue possible after SBRT. Therefore, further prospective trials, especially comparison of OS between SBRT and other modalities for untreated HCC patients, are needed before SBRT can become a competitor of the other modalities, such as RFA and resection. In Japan, the STRSPH study, a multicenter prospective study of SBRT for untreated solitary primary HCC, is on-going, and is yet to publish its findings. In addition, a retrospective study comparing SBRT with RFA suggested a 2-year local progression-free survival of about 80% for both modalities. The author concluded that both RFA and SBRT were effective local treatment options for inoperable HCC (JCO 34: 452-459, 2016). In the future, prospective randomized phase III trials that compare SBRT and RFA or resection are ideal.

"Beyond Sorafenib/Regorafenib - Is There a Role for Other Targeted Therapies in Advanced HCC?","Chan S.L.","Liver Cancer (2017) 6 Supplement 1 (25). Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2017","2017","6",,"25",,"1 Jul 2017","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has conventionally been labelled as an orphan disease due to a lack of effective drug treatment. This concept is no longer true in 2017. In addition to Sorafenib, there are a growing number of drug treatments for advanced HCC. In 2016, a phase III clinical trial (RESOURCE) established Regorafenib as the second-line treatment in patients who tolerated prior sorafenib treatment. In 2017, Lenvatinib was shown to be a non-inferior treatment to sorafenib in the first-line setting. Apart from those multi-targeted small molecules, a number of targeted agents with specific targets have been tested in advanced HCC. These agents typically demonstrated potentially selectivity of efficacy in biomarker enriched population of HCC. Examples include Rmucirumab in alpha-fetoprotein elevated HCC, C-met inhibitors in MET amplified HCC, Everolimus in TSC-2-loss HCC or FGFR4 inhibitors in FGF19 amplified population. In the lecture, these targeted agents are to be discussed with focus on the underlying enrichment approach and presentation of recent clinical trial data in the treatment of advanced HCC.",,,,L644056246,10.1159/000478029

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of nivolumab, a programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with or without chronic viral hepatitis. Methods We did a phase 1/2, open-label, non-comparative, dose escalation and expansion trial (CheckMate 040) of nivolumab in adults (≥18 years) with histologically confirmed advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with or without hepatitis C or B (HCV or HBV) infection. Previous sorafenib treatment was allowed. A dose-escalation phase was conducted at seven hospitals or academic centres in four countries or territories (USA, Spain, Hong Kong, and Singapore) and a dose-expansion phase was conducted at an additional 39 sites in 11 countries (Canada, UK, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan). At screening, eligible patients had Child-Pugh scores of 7 or less (Child-Pugh A or B7) for the dose-escalation phase and 6 or less (Child-Pugh A) for the dose-expansion phase, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less. Patients with HBV infection had to be receiving effective antiviral therapy (viral load <100 IU/mL); antiviral therapy was not required for patients with HCV infection. We excluded patients previously treated with an agent targeting T-cell costimulation or checkpoint pathways. Patients received intravenous nivolumab 0·1–10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in the dose-escalation phase (3+3 design). Nivolumab 3 mg/kg was given every 2 weeks in the dose-expansion phase to patients in four cohorts: sorafenib untreated or intolerant without viral hepatitis, sorafenib progressor without viral hepatitis, HCV infected, and HBV infected. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability for the escalation phase and objective response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1) for the expansion phase. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01658878. Findings Between Nov 26, 2012, and Aug 8, 2016, 262 eligible patients were treated (48 patients in the dose-escalation phase and 214 in the dose-expansion phase). 202 (77%) of 262 patients have completed treatment and follow-up is ongoing. During dose escalation, nivolumab showed a manageable safety profile, including acceptable tolerability. In this phase, 46 (96%) of 48 patients discontinued treatment, 42 (88%) due to disease progression. Incidence of treatment-related adverse events did not seem to be associated with dose and no maximum tolerated dose was reached. 12 (25%) of 48 patients had grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events. Three (6%) patients had treatment-related serious adverse events (pemphigoid, adrenal insufficiency, liver disorder). 30 (63%) of 48 patients in the dose-escalation phase died (not determined to be related to nivolumab therapy). Nivolumab 3 mg/kg was chosen for dose expansion. The objective response rate was 20% (95% CI 15–26) in patients treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg in the dose-expansion phase and 15% (95% CI 6–28) in the dose-escalation phase. Interpretation Nivolumab had a manageable safety profile and no new signals were observed in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Durable objective responses show the potential of nivolumab for treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of S-1, a chemotherapeutic agent based on fluorouracil, in patients with sorafenib-refractory advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study done at 57 sites in Japan. Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were ineligible for surgical or local-regional therapy and judged refractory to sorafenib (ie, had progressed on sorafenib or had discontinued sorafenib because of adverse events) were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive oral S-1 (weight-banded 80 mg/m(2) [80–120 mg per day]), or placebo, twice per day for 28 days consecutively, followed by a minimum 14 day drug-free period. This cycle was repeated until disease progression or the patient became intolerant to the study treatment. Patients were stratified by site and presence or absence of extrahepatic metastasis or vascular invasion. The primary endpoint was overall survival, assessed in the full analysis set (ie, all patients who were treated with study drug except any individuals who were found not to have hepatocellular carcinoma or who were found to have active double cancer). Patients, medical staff, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. Blinding was maintained even after study treatment concluded. This study is registered with JapicCTI, number JapicCTI-090920, and has been completed. Findings Between Oct 26, 2009, and Aug 22, 2012, we screened 399 patients. 65 patients were excluded due to not meeting criteria (n=61), declining to participate (n=3), or other reasons (n=1). 334 patients were randomly assigned to receive either S-1 (n=223) or placebo (n=111). One patient in the S-1 group did not receive treatment, and was thus excluded from analyses. At data cutoff, median follow-up was 32·4 months (IQR 24·0–34·7) in the S-1 group and 32·9 months (23·7–39·5) in the placebo group. Median overall survival was 11·1 months (95% CI 9·7–13·1) in the S-1 group and 11·2 months (9·2–12·8) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·86, 95% CI 0·67–1·10; p=0·220). The most frequently reported adverse events were skin hyperpigmentation (123 [55%] of 222 patients in the S-1 group vs nine [8%] of 111 patients in the placebo group), decreased appetite (104 [47%] vs 21 [19%]), fatigue (102 [46%] vs 20 [18%]), diarrhoea (77 [35%] vs 14 [13%]), and increased blood bilirubin (77 [35%] vs 14 [13%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 90 (41%) of 222 patients in the S-1 group and 24 (22%) of 111 patients in the placebo group. Five treatment-related deaths were reported in the S-1 group.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2017","2017","28",,"iii19","iii20","1 Jun 2017","Introduction: Ramucirumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that specifically targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). In the phase 3, randomized REACH study in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following first-line sorafenib, Ramucirumab improved median overall survival in a prespecified subgroup of patients who had a baseline a-fetoprotein (AFP) level of 400 ng/ mL or greater. HCC patients with high baseline AFP typically have a very poor prognosis and have tumors that exhibit a more aggressive and invasive phenotype. Relationship between the AFP levels and response to anti-angiogenics (ramucirumab) in HCC is not well understood. Methods: CRISPR, shRNA and siRNA techniques were used to silence AFP in AFP high Huh7 cells to understand its role. To better understand the relationship between baseline AFP levels and response to VEGFR2 inhibition in HCC, we performed in vivo xenograft studies using four human HCC cell lines (HuH-7, PLC/PRF/5, SNU-398 and SK-Hep-1) which had differential mRNA expression of AFP. DC101, a rat surrogate for ramucirumab that specifically targets mouse VEGFR-2, was used for the efficacy studies. Expression of 44 human and mouse angiogenesis-related growth factors were evaluated using Luminex based multi-analyte profiling to better understand the differences in these 4 xenograft models. Results: Protein analysis in both cell lysates and in conditioned media confirmed very high and high AFP levels in HuH7 and PLC/PRF/5 respectively, whereas AFP expression by SNU-398 and SK-Hep-1 was below detectable levels. Silencing of AFP reduced the viability of AFP high Huh-7 cells, suggesting that AFP may play a role in regulating cell proliferation in HCC. DC101 inhibited tumor growth in very high AFP HuH-7 and high-AFP PLC-PRF/5 xenograft models, whereas in the AFP negative SNU-398 and SK-Hep-1 xenograft models, mice treated with DC101 exhibited progressive disease. Histological evaluation indicated that DC101 effectively reduced tumor vessels in both very high AFP (HuH-7) and high AFP (SNU-398) xenografts. To investigate potential efficacy differences between the four xenograft models, we evaluated expression of 44 human and mouse angiogenesis-related growth factors. The results demonstrated differential expression of growth factors including VEGF-C, VEGF-D, FGF-2 and IL-8 depending on the AFP levels, of which some showed similar correlations using bioinformatics analysis of up to 26 cell lines. Future studies will focus on confirming these findings in patient derived xenograft models that have patient history, tumor histological staging and gene data available. Conclusion: These studies offer initial mechanistic insights into the efficacy of ramucirumab in HCC patients with high AFP levels, an area of high unmet clinical need.",,,,L619249662,10.1093/annonc/mdx261.024

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2017","2017","28",,"iii150",,"1 Jun 2017","Background: Sorafenib is the recommended treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but dose-limiting toxicity prevents optimal treatment in a considerable proportion of patients. Large cohort studies have indicated potential efficacy of selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with yttrium-90 (Y-90) resin microspheres in intermediate and advanced HCC and therefore the SARAH trial was initiated to directly compare the efficacy and safety of SIRT with sorafenib. Method: SARAHwas a randomised, controlled, open-label, multicentre, investigatorinitiated, phase III trial. Adult patients with locally advanced or recurrent HCC, not amenable to other treatments or after 2 failed rounds of chemoembolisation, were randomised 1:1 to SIRT with Y-90 resin microspheres (SIR-Spheres; Sirtex, North Sydney, Australia) or oral sorafenib 400 mg bid. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS; Kaplan-Meier analysis). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS; Kaplan-Meier analysis), time to radiological progression at any site and in the liver as the first event (competing risk analysis), tumour response, adverse event (AE) rates and quality of life (QoL) measured with the global health status sub-score of the QLQ-C30. Results: Of 459 patients randomised (237 received SIRT; 222 received sorafenib), 67.8% had advanced HCC, 43.6% had chemoembolisation failure and 60.3% had macrovascular invasion, with 33.3% of these having main portal vein involvement. There were no clinically relevant differences between treatment groups at baseline. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, median OS was 8.0 months and 9.9 months in the SIRT and sorafenib groups, respectively (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.94-1.41; p=0.18). In the population of 174 SIRT and 206 sorafenib patients that received treatment per protocol (PP), median OS was 9.9 months in both groups (HR, 0.99; 95% CI 0.79-1.24; p=0.92). Median PFS in the ITT analysis was 4.1 months and 3.7 months in the SIRT and sorafenib groups, respectively (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.85-1.25; p=0.76). Cumulative incidence of radiological progression in the liver as first event was significantly lower in the SIRT than in the sorafenib group (ITT HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56-0.93; p=0.014). Objective response rate (complete response or partial response) was significantly higher in the SIRT than in the sorafenib group (19.0% vs. 11.6%, p=0.042). The number of patients with ≥1 treatment-related AE was 173 (76.5%) and 203 (94.0%; p<0.001), including 92 (40.7%) and 136 (63.0%) grade ≥3 AEs (p<0.001) in the SIRT and sorafenib groups, respectively. QoL was significantly better in the SIRT than in the sorafenib group (group effect p=0.005; time effect p<0.001), and the between-group difference tended to increase with time (group-time interaction p=0.045). Conclusions: OS was not statistically different between sorafenib and SIRT in patients with locally advanced or recurrent HCC. However, liver-directed SIRT was significantly more effective than daily sorafenib systemic treatment in controlling tumour progression in the liver, provides a better tumour response rate, produced fewer treatmentrelated adverse events, and maintained a better QoL over the first 12 months of treatment.",,,,L619250064,10.1093/annonc/mdx302

Date of Publication: 1 Mar 2017","2017","152","4","745","761","1 Mar 2017","Primary liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and therefore a major public health challenge. We review hypotheses of the cell of origin of liver tumorigenesis and clarify the classes of liver cancer based on molecular features and how they affect patient prognosis. Primary liver cancer comprises hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), and other rare tumors, notably fibrolamellar carcinoma and hepatoblastoma. The molecular and clinical features of HCC versus iCCA are distinct, but these conditions have overlapping risk factors and pathways of oncogenesis. A better understanding of the cell types originating liver cancer can aid in exploring molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and therapeutic options. Molecular studies have identified adult hepatocytes as the cell of origin. These cells have been proposed to transform directly into HCC cells (via a sequence of genetic alterations), to dedifferentiate into hepatocyte precursor cells (which then become HCC cells that express progenitor cell markers), or to transdifferentiate into biliary-like cells (which give rise to iCCA). Alternatively, progenitor cells also give rise to HCCs and iCCAs with markers of progenitor cells. Advances in genome profiling and next-generation sequencing have led to the classification of HCCs based on molecular features and assigned them to categories such as proliferation–progenitor, proliferation–transforming growth factor β, and Wnt–catenin β1. iCCAs have been assigned to categories of proliferation and inflammation. Overall, proliferation subclasses are associated with a more aggressive phenotype and poor outcome of patients, although more specific signatures have refined our prognostic abilities. Analyses of genetic alterations have identified those that might be targeted therapeutically, such as fusions in the FGFR2 gene and mutations in genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenases (in approximately 60% of iCCAs) or amplifications at 11q13 and 6p21 (in approximately 15% of HCCs). Further studies of these alterations are needed before they can be used as biomarkers in clinical decision making.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01755767)",20170168663,28043904,L614676614,10.1053/j.gastro.2016.11.048

Date of Publication: 1 Mar 2017","2017","39","3",,,"1 Mar 2017","Over the past 4 years, cancer immunotherapy has significantly prolonged survival time of patients with prostate cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, and liver cancer, but its side effects are also impressive. Different types of the immune therapeutic agents have different on-target or off-target toxicity due to high affinity or weak specificity, respectively. Treatment toxicity spectrums vary greatly even in patients with the same type of cancer. Common toxicities are fevers, chills, diarrhea colitis, maculopapular rash, hepatitis, and hormone gland disorder; therefore, routine monitoring of thyroid function, liver function, renal function, and complete blood count are absolutely necessary once treatment begins.

However, when new treatment regimens are widely used in “The Real World”, the safety and efficacy may not be as good as that seen in clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of PrOD prospectively in a real world setting, within Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), a large U.S. based Health Care Delivery System. Efficacy was determined by a measure of sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12). METHODS: N = 200 patients were enrolled at four sites within KPSC. Inclusion criteria: Chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1 (GT1), age ≥ 18, treatment-naive (TN) or treatment-experienced (TE) with interferonbased therapy. Exclusion criteria were non-GT1 chronic hepatitis C, co-infection with HIV or HBV, prior treatment with direct-acting antiviral agent(s), glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/minute, hemoglobin < 12 for males and < 11 for females, and/or evidence of cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. Cirrhosis was defined as Metavir score > 3 or Ishak score > 4 on liver biopsy, Fibroscan score > 12.5 kPa, APRI score of > 1.5, clinical evidence of cirrhosis and/or history of hepatic decompensation. Genotype 1a (GT1a) patients were treated with PrOD + weight-based RBV × 12 weeks and Genotype 1b (GT1b) patients were treated with PrOD × 12 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 200 patients enrolled, 191 have completed enrollment and 9 remain in active follow up. 170 patients have achieved SVR12, with an intention-to treat (ITT) SVR12 rate of 89% (170/191). Of the 21 failures to achieve SVR12, 10 patients completed treatment with an End of Treatment (EOT) response and had a relapse of hepatitis C viral load (HCV VL) during post-treatment follow up, 3 patients were lost to follow up, and 8 patients discontinued treatment early due to side effects. For those patients that who completed treatment and had post-treatment week 12 HCV VL results available, 94.4% (170/180) achieved SVR12. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study conducted in a “Real World” care delivery setting, treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C with PrOD ribavirin was well tolerated and highly effective. Sustained virological response rates have been comparable to those seen in the registration trials. This prospective study in a single care delivery system, supports findings from prior large retrospective studies reported in the “Real World” treatment setting.",,,,L624716574,

Chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin are currently used as first-line agents for HCC therapy, but these are non-selective cytotoxic molecules with significant side effects. Sorafenib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the only approved targeted drug for HCC patients. However, due to adverse side effects and limited efficacy, there is a need for the identification of novel pharmacological drugs beyond sorafenib. Several agents that target and inhibit various signaling pathways involved in HCC are currently being assessed for HCC treatment. In the present review article, we summarize the diverse signal transduction pathways responsible for initiation as well as progression of HCC and also the potential anticancer effects of selected targeted therapies that can be employed for HCC therapy.

This exploratory analysis demonstrates the relationship between a potential ramucirumab survival benefit, severity of liver disease, and baseline α-fetoprotein (αFP). Objective: To assess treatment effects and tolerability of ramucirumab by Child-Pugh score in patients with HCC enrolled in the REACH trial. Design, Settings, and Participants: Randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial of ramucirumab and best supportive care vs placebo and best supportive care as second-line treatment in patients with HCC enrolled between November 4, 2010 and April 18, 2013, from 154 global sites. Overall, 643 patients were randomized and included in this analysis; 565 patients considered Child-Pugh class A (Child-Pugh scores 5 and 6) and 78 patients considered class B (Child-Pugh scores 7 and 8). Interventions: Ramucirumab (8 mg/kg) or placebo intravenously plus best supportive care every 2 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival (OS), defined as time from randomization to death from any cause. Results: In the randomized population of 643 patients (mean [SD] age, 62.8 [11.1] years) in this analysis, a potential ramucirumab OS benefit was observed for patients with a Child-Pugh score of 5 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.63-1.02; P = .06) but no apparent benefit for patients with Child-Pugh scores of 6 or 7 and 8. In patients with baseline αFP levels of 400 ng/mL (to convert ng/mL to μg/L, multiply by 1.0) or more, a ramucirumab OS benefit was significant for a score of Child-Pugh 5 (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.43-0.87; P = .01) and Child-Pugh 6 (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.98; P = .04), but was not significant for Child-Pugh 7 and 8. The overall safety profile of ramucirumab, regardless of Child-Pugh score, was considered manageable. Regardless of treatment arm, patients with Child-Pugh scores of 7 and 8 experienced a higher incidence of grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events, including ascites and asthenia, and special-interest events, including liver injury and/or failure and bleeding, compared with patients with Child-Pugh scores of 5 or 6. Conclusions and Relevance: In unselected patients, a trend for ramucirumab survival benefit was observed only for patients with a Child-Pugh score of 5. In patients with baseline αFP levels of 400 ng/mL or more, a ramucirumab survival benefit was observed for Child-Pugh scores of 5 and 6. Ramucirumab had a manageable toxic effect profile. These results support the ongoing REACH-2 study of ramucirumab in patients with advanced HCC with underlying Child-Pugh A cirrhosis and baseline αFP levels of 400 ng/mL or more.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in patients with HCC who have progressed during sorafenib treatment. Methods In this randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 trial done at 152 sites in 21 countries, adults with HCC who tolerated sorafenib (≥400 mg/day for ≥20 of last 28 days of treatment), progressed on sorafenib, and had Child-Pugh A liver function were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) by a computer-generated randomisation list and interactive voice response system and stratified by geographical region, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, macrovascular invasion, extrahepatic disease, and α-fetoprotein level to best supportive care plus oral regorafenib 160 mg or placebo once daily during weeks 1–3 of each 4-week cycle. Investigators, patients, and the funder were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival (defined as time from randomisation to death due to any cause) and analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774344. Findings Between May 14, 2013, and Dec 31, 2015, 843 patients were screened, of whom 573 were enrolled and randomised (379 to regorafenib and 194 to placebo; population for efficacy analyses), and 567 initiated treatment (374 received regorafenib and 193 received placebo; population for safety analyses). Regorafenib improved overall survival with a hazard ratio of 0·63 (95% CI 0·50–0·79; one-sided p<0·0001); median survival was 10·6 months (95% CI 9·1–12·1) for regorafenib versus 7·8 months (6·3–8·8) for placebo. Adverse events were reported in all regorafenib recipients (374 [100%] of 374) and 179 (93%) of 193 placebo recipients. The most common clinically relevant grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent events were hypertension (57 patients [15%] in the regorafenib group vs nine patients [5%] in the placebo group), hand–foot skin reaction (47 patients [13%] vs one [1%]), fatigue (34 patients [9%] vs nine patients [5%]), and diarrhoea (12 patients [3%] vs no patients). Of the 88 deaths (grade 5 adverse events) reported during the study (50 patients [13%] assigned to regorafenib and 38 [20%] assigned to placebo), seven (2%) were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug in the regorafenib group and two (1%) in the placebo group, including two patients (1%) with hepatic failure in the placebo group. Interpretation Regorafenib is the only systemic treatment shown to provide survival benefit in HCC patients progressing on sorafenib treatment. Future trials should explore combinations of regorafenib with other systemic agents and third-line treatments for patients who fail or who do not tolerate the sequence of sorafenib and regorafenib.

Newly designed, potential therapeutic regimens target specific receptors, kinases, and vital proteins. Sorafenib is the only FDA-approved drug for HCC treatment, and it has been found that the complex genomic aberrations in HCC can be overcome using combination therapy. For example, therapeutic benefits have been gained using sorafenib with doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, cisplatin, and monoclonal antibodies.

Date of Publication: 2017","2017","6",,,,"2017","Background: There is an active debate about the role that endpoints other than overall survival (OS) should play in the drug approval process. Yet the term 'surrogate endpoint' implies that OS is the only critical metric for regulatory approval of cancer treatments. We systematically analyzed the relationship between U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and publication of OS evidence to understand better the risks and benefits of delaying approval until OS evidence is available. Scope: Using the PACE Continuous Innovation Indicators (CII) platform, we analyzed the effects of cancer type, treatment goal, and year of approval on the lag time between FDA approval and publication of first significant OS finding for 53 treatments approved between 1952 and 2016 for 10 cancer types (n = 71 approved indications). Findings: Greater than 59% of treatments were approved before significant OS data for the approved indication were published. Of the drugs in the sample, 31% had lags between approval and first published OS evidence of 4 years or longer. The average number of years between approval and first OS evidence varied by cancer type and did not reliably predict the eventual amount of OS evidence accumulated. Conclusions: Striking the right balance between early access and minimizing risk is a central challenge for regulators worldwide. We illustrate that endpoints other than OS have long helped to provide timely access to new medicines, including many current standards of care. We found that many critical drugs are approved many years before OS data are published, and that OS may not be the most appropriate endpoint in some treatment contexts. Our examination of approved treatments without significant OS data suggests contexts where OS may not be the most relevant endpoint and highlights the importance of using a wide variety of fit-forpurpose evidence types in the approval process.",,,,L620529609,10.7573/dic.212507

Geometric mean exposures in Cycle 1 and Cycles 1 plus 2 for REG were 1867 and 1496 ng/mL, respectively (geometric CVs 43.8% and 45.1%) and for free aggregatewere 24.6 and 19.6 nmol/L (geometric CVs 48.1% and 50.6%). Therewas a trend for a difference in OS between the exposure groups, with the lowest median OS in the low exposure groups (REG [95% CI]: 260 days [194, 331]). OS was 374 days (272, 451) for the medium REG and 472 days (341, 655) for the high REG group. However, the median OS in all REG and all free aggregate exposure groups was prolonged in comparison to placebo in RESORCE (237 days [192, 269]). No obvious correlation between selected treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; all grade and grade ≥3) and exposure to REG and free aggregate was observed. Low exposure groups experienced more TEAEs during the first cycle which resulted in dose modifications (low exposure group 36.1% vs 20.9% and 14.5% in medium and high exposure groups, respectively). A similar trend was observed for dose modifications during the whole treatment period. Conclusions: A trend for shorter median OS in the low REG exposure groupwas observed but therewas no difference for the medium/high exposure groups. No consistent, relevant relationship between exposure to REG and relevant safety variables explored in this analysis was observed. More frequent dose modifications were associated with lower exposure. The analyses support the use of the approved dose of REG 160 mg QD in early treatment cycles in HCC.",,,,L621221805,

Regorafenib has been investigated for its efficacy and safety as a second-line treatment in a phase III trial (RESORCE trial). However, this trial designed based on stringent enrollment criteria and included patients who had a radiological progression during sorafenib treatment and a tolerability of dosage of sorafenib 400 mg or more. The goal of this study was to assess characteristics of advanced HCC patients who had possibility to convert to 2nd line treatment especially regorafenib from sorafenib in the field practice. Methods: Patients with HCC treated with sorafenib as first line systemic therapy were retrospectively analyzed based on the database of Chiba University Hospital. This study included only Child-Pugh A and ECOG-PS ≤1 patients. We defined 2nd line candidate patients as maintaining Child-Pugh A and ECOG-PS ≤1 at the time of radiological progression or treatment discontinuation according to adverse events. We also defined regorafenib candidate patients as follows: (1) continued sorafenib at the time of radiological progression, (2) maintaining Child-Pugh A and ECOG-PS ≤1 at the time of radiological progression, and (3) continuing sorafenib 400 mg or more without intolerable adverse events more than 21 days of last 28 days of treatment. Results: Of 185 patients, 127 patients (69%) were Child-Pugh score 5 and 112 patients (61%) were ECOG-PS 0. Fifty-five patients (30%) had macrovascular invasion and 83 patients (45%) had extrahepatic metastasis. Majority of patients (161 patients, 87%) continued sorafenib until radiological progression. Overall survival and time to progression were 14.8 months (12.3-17.3 months) and 2.9 months (2.3-3.5 months), respectively. According to our definition, 130 patients (70.1%) and 69 patients (37.3%) were candidate of 2nd line treatment and regorafenib. Child-Pugh score 5 and ECOG-PS 0 at the time of starting sorafenib were significantly higher in both 2nd line treatment and regorafenib candidate patients. In multivariate analysis, those two factors had significantly high odd ratio of conversion from sorafenib in HCC patients. Conclusions: Regorafeib candidate patients were not majority of sorafenib treated HCC patients. Patients whowere Child-Pugh score 5 and ECOG-PS 0 patients seemed to be likely to convert to regorafenib from sorafenib.",,,,L621222130,

Sorafenib, the current recommended treatment for advanced HCC, has a high level of toxicity. Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with yttrium-90 (Y-90) resin microspheres has shown efficacy in cohort studies, but there is no head-to-head trial versus sorafenib in advanced HCC. The SARAH trial was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of these treatments. Methods: SARAH was a randomised, controlled, open-label, multicentre, investigator initiated, phase III trial. Patients with locally advanced or recurrent HCC, not amenable to other treatments or after 2 failed rounds of chemoembolisation, were randomised 1:1 to SIRT with Y-90 resin microspheres or oral sorafenib 800 mg daily. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS; Kaplan Meier analysis). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS; Kaplan Meier analysis), time to radiological progression at any site and in the liver as the first event (competing risk analysis), tumour response and serious adverse events rates. Results: Of 459 patients randomised between December 2011 and February2015,237receivedSIRTand222receivedsorafenib.Mean(SD) age was 65.2 (9.4) years, 414 (90.2%) were male; 223 patients had advancedHCC,113hadchemoembolisationfailure,88haveboth and35 were not eligible to any curative treatment. The most frequent liver disease was alcoholic cirrhosis (65.1%). In the intention-to-treat analysis, median OS was 8.0 months and 9.9 months in the SIRT and sorafenib groups, respectively (p = 0.179). Median PFS was 4.1 months and 3.7 months in the SIRT and sorafenib groups, respectively (p = 0.727). Cumulative incidence of radiological progression at any site did not differ in both groups (p = 0.255). Cumulative incidence of radiological progressioninthe liveras firsteventwas significantlylower in the SIRT than in the sorafenib group (p = 0.015), corresponding to a 27% reduction of the sub-distribution hazard ratio (SHR = 0.731 [95% confidence interval, 0.569-0.939]).

We present a prospective comparison of investigator-assessed tumor response and progression by the HCC-specific mRECIST and by RECIST 1.1. Methods: Adults with HCC Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B or C who had radiological progression during sorafenib treatment, Child-Pugh A liver function, and ECOG performance status 0-1 were randomized 2:1 to regorafenib 160 mg or placebo once daily during weeks 1-3 of each 4-week cycle.

At early stages, recurrence after resection/ablation occurs in 70% of patients at 5 years. The STORM trial showed no significant differences in recurrence-free survival (RFS) for sorafenib treatment as compared to placebo.We conducted a biomarker companion study (BIOSTORM, level B evidence) aimed at defining molecular prognostic factors and predictors of recurrence prevention with sorafenib. Methods: Tumour samples from 188 resected HCC patients treated in STORM with sorafenib (83) or placebo (105) were analysed after IRB approval and specific informed consent. Prognostic/predictive biomarkers were analysed by: gene expression (DASL; exploring signalling pathways, prognostic signatures and new signature of sorafenib benefit), targeted exome sequencing of 18 mutational drivers; assessment of activation of MAPK signalling (pERK immunostaining) and angiogenesis (pVEGFR2 staining and VEGFA-FISH). RFS events occurred in 70 cases (all eventswere recurrences, and thus time to recurrence (TTR) is equivalent to RFS). A Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to assess prognostic/predictive biomarkers. Results: BIOSTORM cohort recapitulates the clinical-pathological characteristics of STORM. Regarding prognostic variables for RFS, positive hepatocyte pERK staining (HR = 2.41; CI95%: 1.21-4.80; p = 0.012) and microvascular invasion were independent prognostic factors. Positive hepatocyte pERK (20/175; 11%) was associated with proliferation gene signatures (p < 0.001), poor differentiation (p = 0.01) and Ki-67 positivity (p < 0.05). BIOSTORM did not identify candidate biomarkers predicting recurrence prevention to sorafenib. Biomarkers related to angiogenesis (pVEGFR2 staining, endothelial pERK staining and VEGFA amplification), proliferation (proliferation signatures, Ki-67), previously proposed gene signatures or mutations were not independently associated with recurrence or prevention with sorafenib. A newly generated multi-gene signature correlated with improved RFS on sorafenib vs placebo. Conclusions: In BIOSTORM, hepatocyte pERK+ immunostaining and microvascular invasion were independent prognostic factors of RFS. No mutation, gene amplification or previously proposed signature predicted recurrence or prevention with sorafenib. A newly generated multi-gene signature associated with improved RFS on sorafenib would require external validation.",,,,L621223215,

Therefore the aim of this analysiswas to translate short-term findings from the study into long-term predictions of the impact of EBR/GZR compared to SOF + PR on the incidence of liver-related morbidity and mortality in Italy. Methods: A computer-based mathematical model of the natural history of chronic HCV infection and liver disease was developed to project lifetime cumulative incidence of decompensated cirrhosis (DC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver-transplant (LT) and liverrelated death. Efficacy for both regimens was obtained from the CEDGE Head-2-Head trial. The proportion of overall, G1 and G4 patients achieving sustained viral response 12 weeks after the completion of therapy was 99.2% (128/129), 99.2% (122/123) and 100% (6/6) respectively in the EBR/GZR group and 90.5% (114/126), 91.7% (111/121) and 60% (3/5) respectively in the SOF/PR groups. Data on baseline characteristics of the simulated patients were obtained from PITER-HCV cohort study. Natural history parameters were estimated from published studies.We estimated base case values for incidence and conducted sensitivity analyses. Results: EBR/GZR was projected to reduce lifetime cumulative incidence of DC by 18.93%, 17.66% and 52.32% overall and in G1 and G4 respectively compared with SOF + PR (Table 1). The incidence of HCC was projected to be reduced by 29.40%, 27.60% and 66.57% overall and in G1 and 4 patients who received EBR/GZR respectively relative to SOF + PR. As a result, EBR/GZR was projected to reduce liver-related mortality by 25.83% relative to SOF + PR in overall population. EBR/GZR extended life expectancy by 0.58 years compared with SOF + PR in overall population. The results were sensitive to assumed patient characteristics. Limitation includes small G4 sample size. Conclusions: Based on efficacy data from the C-EDGE Head-2-Head study, EBR/GZRwas projected to substantially reduce the incidence of liver-related complications and mortality in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients with hepatitis C virus G1 and 4 infection when compared with the use of SOF + PR in Italy (Table presented).",,,,L621223423,

Achievement of SVR following peginterferon (PegIFN) ± ribavirin (RBV) significantly decreases developments of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) post treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the incidence of HCC in patients who achieved SVR by LDV/ SOF were similarly reduced as IFN. Methods: Three hundred fifteen Japanese patients with HCV GT-1 received LDV/SOF for 12 weeks at 18 hospitals as a multicenter Phase 3 clinical trial in 2013. For control subjects, we simultaneously enrolled 336 HCV GT-1 patients who received simeprevir (SMV) with PegIFN plus RBV for 24weeks. To identify HCC, all patients underwent ultrasonography, contrast-enhanced computer tomography (CT) or Gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by the treatment before 4 months and prospectively followed 2 years after the treatment. Results: All patients achieved SVR and had not the treatment history of HCC. There were no difference in Age, Sex, BMI, ALT, PLT, HCVRNA and history of IFN treatment at baseline between LDV/SOF and PegIFN/RBV/SMV group. However, AFP levels in LDV/SOF group were significantly higher than those in PegIFN/RBV/SMV group (11.2 and 7.4 ng/mL, P < 0.05). The number of patients with advanced fibrosis (Fibroscan® >12.5 kPa or FibroTest® >0.75) were significantly increased LDV/SOF group compared with PegIFN/RBV/SMV group (69 [23%] and 50 [15%], P < 0.05). Eleven patients who were detected non-hypervascular hepatic nodules by CT or Gd-EOB-DTPAenhanced MRI at before the treatment were excluded in the study. Only one (0.3%) of LDV/SOF patient developed HCC at 2 years after the treatment. On the other hand, 8 (LDV/SOF n = 6, PegIFN/RBV/SMV n = 2) of 11 (72%) patients who were excluded in the study for liver tumour developed HCC within 1 year after the treatment. Conclusions: The incidence of HCC improved following only 12-week LDV/SOF regimen to a similar degree as achieved with PegIFN/ RBV/SMV.

The approval of sorafenib has stimulated a lot of efforts in developing therapeutics for HCC. However, until 2015 multiple phase III trials have been conducted, but failed to prove superior or sufficient efficacy as the first-line and second-line therapy for advanced HCC [Hsu CH et al, 2014]. The RESORCE trial is a randomized phase III study comparing regorafenib with a placebo in patients with HCC who had progressed sorafenib treatment [Bruix J et al, 2017]. Regorafenib, compared with a placebo, conferred a significant improvement of overall survival (OS) (median OS 10.6 months vs 7.8 months, with hazard ratio (HR) 0.62, 95% C.I. 0.50-0.78, P < 0.001). In Apr 2017, regorafenib was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of HCC patients who have been previously treated with sorafenib. Immunotherapy especially blockade of immune checkpoints has recently demonstrated impressive clinical activities in multiple cancer types including HCC. Check Mate 040 is a phase I/II trial of nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody against PD-1, involving 262 HCC patients who have progressed at least one line of systemic therapy [El-Khoueiry AB et al, 2017]. Nivolumab at the dose of 3 mg/kg exhibited an objective response rate of 20% (95% CI 15-26) in HCC patients enrolled in the dose-expansion phase. Most recently, the phase III trial of lenvatinib versus sorafenib as first-line therapy for unresectable HCC was reported in 2017 Annual Meeting of American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [Cheng AL et al: 2017ASCO]. The study met its primary endpoint, showing that lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in OS (median OS 13.6 months vs 12.3 months for lenvatinib vs. sorafenib, with HR 0.92, 95% C.I. 0.79-1.02). Lenvatinib, compared with sorafenib, exhibited statistically significant improvements in time to tumor progression, progression-free survival, and response rate in unresectable HCC. The encouraging results of regorafenib, lenvatinib, and nivolumab have enriched our armaments for the treatment of HCC. Future studies are warranted to define the optimal use of these therapeutics, and to identify predictive and prognostic biomarkers for implementing personalized therapy for advanced HCC.",,,,L627349558,

Methods Participants from a phase III multicenter randomized trial of SIRT versus Sorafenib in HCC were studied. Thirty five patients with HCC were treated with selective internal radiation therapy or Sorafenib at our institution. Thirty one patients with baseline AFP higher than 20ng/ml were studied for analysis. AFP response was defined as more than 50% decrease from baseline. Twenty six patients with follow-up imaging were studied for the AFP imaging correlation analysis. We studied the relationship between AFP response and treatment outcome in terms of radiologic response and overall survival. Results Of 39 patients, 31 patients (79.4%) with elevated serum AFP (>20ng/ml) and documented radiologic evaluation every 12 weeks. AFP response was seen in 3 (17.6%) of 17 and 6 (40%) of 15 of patients treated with Sorafenib and Selective internal radiation therapy, respectively (P=0.16). The hazard ratio in AFP nonresponders compared with responders was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.46-2.69). AFP responders had better survival than nonresponders (15 and 6.95 months, respectively; P< .79), and AFP response was strongly associated with survival (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.46 to 2.69; P< 0.79). AFP response were frequently observed in patients with radiologically stable disease (SD) and tended to indentify a subgroup of SD patients with better survival.

Sorafenib and Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) are clinically proven treatment options in patients with unresectable HCC, and this study aims to assess overall survival following either SIRT or Sorafenib therapy for locally advanced HCC patients. Methods: This investigator-initiated, multi-centre, open-label, randomized, controlled trial will enrol 360 patients with locally advanced HCC, as defined by Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or stage C, without distant metastases, and which is not amenable to immediate curative treatment. Exclusion criteria include previous systemic therapy, metastatic disease, complete occlusion of the main portal vein, or a Child-Pugh score of >7. Eligible patients will be randomised 1:1 and stratified by centre and presence or absence of portal vein thrombosis to receive either a single administration of SIRT using yttrium-90 resin microspheres (SIR-Spheres®, Sirtex Medical Limited, Sydney, Australia) targeted at HCC in the liver by the trans-arterial route or continuous oral Sorafenib (Nexavar®, Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany) at a dose of 400 mg twice daily until disease progression, no further response, complete regression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients for both the Sorafenib and SIRT arms will be followed-up every 4 weeks for the first 3 months and 12 weekly thereafter. Overall survival is the primary endpoint, assessed for the intention-to-treat population. Secondary endpoints are tumour response rate, time-to-tumour progression, progression free survival, quality of life and down-staging to receive potentially curative therapy. Discussion: Definitive data comparing these two therapies will help to determine clinical practice in the large group of patients with locally advanced HCC and improve outcomes for such patients.

Genetic studies in the last decade have unveiled that gp96 is also an essential master chaperone for multiple receptors and secreting proteins including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), integrins, the Wnt coreceptor, Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 6 (LRP6), the latent TGFβ docking receptor, Glycoprotein A Repetitions Predominant (GARP), Glycoprotein (GP) Ib and insulin-like growth factors (IGF). Clinically, elevated expression of gp96 in a variety of cancers correlates with the advanced stage and poor survival of cancer patients. Recent preclinical studies have also uncovered that gp96 expression is closely linked to cancer progression in multiple myeloma, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer and inflammation-associated colon cancer. Thus, gp96 is an attractive therapeutic target for cancer treatment. The chaperone function of gp96 depends on its ATPase domain, which is structurally distinct from other HSP90 members, and thus favors the design of highly selective gp96-targeted inhibitors against cancer. We herein discuss the strategically important oncogenic clients of gp96 and their underlying biology. The roles of cell-intrinsic gp96 in T cell biology are also discussed, in part because it offers another opportunity of cancer therapy by manipulating levels of gp96 in T cells to enhance host immune defense.",,,27072698,L612155376,10.2174/1568026616666160413141613

Patients with NASH and fibrosis are at high risk of increased mortality. Obeticholic Acid (OCA) is a selective and potent farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist, that has been shown to improve liver histology, including NAFLD activity score (NAS) and fibrosis, in a Phase 2 clinical trial (FLINT). Furthermore in FLINT, OCA treated patients had significant improvements in select liver biochemistries, markers of inflammation, and select cardiometabolic parameters. Aims & Methods: The ongoing, randomized, global, Phase 3 study REGENERATE, will further evaluate the effect of OCA on liver histology and clinical outcomes in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH with stage 2-3 fibrosis. 2065 patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to 10 mg OCA, 25mgOCA or placebo, each added to standard of care. An interim analysis at 18 months will evaluate the effect of OCA on liver histology. Total study duration is driven by time required to accrue a total of 264 outcome events and is estimated to be ∼6 years. Safety assessments will include adverse events (AEs), adjudicated cardiovascular events, and hepatic events as well as laboratory assessments. The effect of OCA on NASH and fibrosis severity will also be assessed by multiple noninvasive methods (FIB-4, APRI, transient elastography, magnetic resonance elastography, etc.). Results: The co-primary liver histology endpoints at 18 months include: (I) improvement in fibrosis by ≥1 stage with no worsening of NASH and (II) resolution of NASH with no worsening in fibrosis stage. Further, confirmation of clinical benefit of OCA will be assessed at the end of the study by comparing the time to first occurrence of any of the following adjudicated events: histological progression to cirrhosis; uncontrolled ascites; hospitalization for: variceal bleed, hepatic encephalopathy or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; hepatocellular carcinoma; liver transplant or eligibility for liver transplant (defined by model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥15); and death. Conclusion: REGENERATE is the first pivotal study in NASH, designed in conjunction with FDA and meant to support approval of OCA for NASH with fibrosis. This robust Phase 3 study is designed to evaluate the effect of OCA on liver histology and effects on progression to cirrhosis, liver-related clinical outcomes and mortality.",,,,L619935169,10.1177/2050640616663689

Aims & Methods: Characterize efficacy and safety of sorafenib in routine clinical practice in Italian centers. Data from the Italian subgroup of GIDEON (international study) and from STELLA (Italian study), two prospective observational studies were pooled. Efficacy and safety of sorafenib were primary objectives in the two studies. Eligible patients were those for whom the decision to treat with sorafenib has been made prior to enrollment. Results: Between June 2009 and January 2014, 512 patients were enrolled in both studies of which 498 were valid for efficacy and 485 for safety analysis. Demographic characteristics: male 81%, median age 70y (range 28-90) and >26% 75y or above. Etiology: hepatitis C in 55% and hepatitis B in 20% of patients. The majority (62%) had ECOG PS 0 and Child-Pugh A/B/C was present in 79/13/1% respectively. More than half of patients were BCLC stage C (58%) whereas BCLC B and BCLC A accounted for 31% and 9% respectively. Overall incidence of adverse events-(AE) (all grades) was 82%. The most frequent were fatigue (29%), diarrhea (24%) and hand-foot skin reaction (16%). Incidence of AEs resulting in permanent discontinuation (drugrelated or not) was 32%.

Advanced stage HCC includes heterogeneous groups of patients with different clinical condition and radiological features and sorafenib is the only approved treatment according to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer. Since the introduction of sorafenib in clinical practice, several phase ? clinical trials have failed to demonstrate any superiority over sorafenib in the frontline setting.

In addition to VEGFR and PDGFR, dovitinib inhibits FGFR. Frontline oral dovitinib (500 mg/day, 5 days on, 2 days off; n = 82) versus sorafenib (400 mg twice daily; n = 83) was evaluated in an open-label, randomized phase 2 study of Asian-Pacific patients with advanced HCC.

Patients included in the study were ineligible for surgical and/or locoregional therapies or had disease progression after receiving these therapies. The median OS (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 8.0 (6.6-9.1) months for dovitinib and 8.4 (5.4-11.3) months for sorafenib.

Compared to HCC without PVTT, HCC with PVTT is characterized by an aggressive disease course, worse hepatic function, a higher chance of complications related to portal hypertension and poorer tolerance to treatment. Conventionally, HCC with PVTT is grouped together with metastatic HCC during the planning of its management, and most patients are offered palliative treatment with sorafenib or other systemic agents. As a result, most data on the management of HCC with PVTT comes from subgroup analyses or retrospective series. In the past few years, there have been several updates on management of HCC with PVTT. First, it is evident that HCC with PVTT consists of heterogeneous subgroups with different prognoses. Different classifications have been proposed to stage the degree of portal vein invasion/thrombosis, suggesting that different treatment modalities may be individualized to patients with different risks. Second, more studies indicate that more aggressive treatment, including surgical resection or locoregional treatment, may benefit select HCC patients with PVTT.

Additionally, there is growing evidence for the prognostic significance of PVTT classification according to the location of tumor thrombosis. Favorable outcomes can be obtained by applying local modalities, including surgery or transarterial chemoembolization, especially in second-order or distal branch PVTT. Rapid control of PVTT could maintain or improve liver function and reduce intrahepatic as well as distant metastasis. Radiotherapy (RT) is one of the main locoregional treatment modalities in oncologic fields, but has rarely been used in HCC because of concerns regarding hepatic toxicity. However, with the development of advanced techniques, RT has been increasingly applied in HCC management. Randomized studies have yet to definitively prove the benefit of RT, but several comparative studies have justified the application of RT in HCC. The value of RT is especially noticeable in HCC with PVTT; several prospective and retrospective studies have reported favorable outcomes, including a 40% to 60% objective response rate and median overall survival of 15 mo to 20 mo in responders.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2016","2016","73","11","764","774","1 Jun 2016","Purpose. The treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 has changed rapidly with recently approved direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens. The role of the pharmacist in the management of HCV therapy has increased. Summary. Chronic HCV infection is the main cause of end-stage liver disease and the primary reason for liver transplantation, liver-related death, and hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States. The recent approval of several DAAs has led to improved tolerability, sustained virological response (SVR) rates, and shorter treatment durations compared with treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Most HCV cases can be treated with the currently available regimens, and expected SVR rates exceed 90%. Several fixed-dose and pangenotypic antiviral regimens are currently in various phases of clinical trials. Pharmacists are well equipped to assist the medical team and patients with comprehensive management of HCV treatment. Pharmacists in various settings can play an instrumental role in access to HCV medications, selection of HCV treatment, detection of drug-drug interactions, and education of patients about potential adverse effects and the importance of adherence and laboratory test monitoring during HCV treatment. However, the high cost of HCV treatment poses challenges for ubiquitous treatment. Conclusion. Available DAA regimens have improved HCV treatment outcomes and are selected based on efficacy, potential drug interactions, and the patient's ability to obtain medication coverage. Each of these factors provides an opportunity for pharmacist involvement in HCV management.",,,27126832,L610615094,10.2146/ajhp150704

Aim: Characterize efficacy and safety of sorafenib in routine clinical practice in Italian centers. Materials and methods: Data from the Italian subgroup of GIDEON (international study) and from STELLA (Italian study), two prospective observational studies were pooled. Efficacy and safety of sorafenib were primary objectives in the two studies. Eligible patients were those for whom the decision to treat with sorafenib has been made prior to enrollment. Results: Between June 2009 and January 2014, 512 patients were enrolled in both studies of which 498 were valid for efficacy and 485 for safety analysis. Demographic characteristics: male 81%, median age 70 y (range 28–90) and >26% 75 y or above. Etiology: hepatitis C in 55% and hepatitis B in 20% of patients. The majority (62%) had ECOG PS 0 and Child-Pugh A/B/C was present in 79/13/1% respectively. More than half of patients were BCLC stage C (58%) whereas BCLC B and BCLC A accounted for 31% and 9% respectively. Overall incidence of adverse events-(AE) (all grades) was 82%. The most frequent were fatigue (29%), diarrhea (24%) and hand-foot skin reaction (16%). Incidence of AEs resulting in permanent discontinuation (drug-related or not) was 32%. Median overall survival was 10.7 [95%CI: 9.3–12.7] months and median time to progression was 6 [95%CI: 5.2–7.0] months. Conclusions: This pooled analysis represents the largest prospective database of patients treated with sorafenib in routine clinical practice in Italian centers and confirms the efficacy and safety data of the phase III registrational studies.

In the era of directacting antivirals,these patients have become one of the most challenging to treat,due to fewer effective drug options,higher risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and lower sustained virological response (SVR) rates. Currently there are 4 recommended drugs for the treatment of HCV genotype 3: pegylated interferon (PegIFN),sofosbuvir (SOF),daclatasvir (DCV) and ribavirin (RBV). Treatment with PegIFN,SOF and RBV for 12 weeks has an overall SVR rate of 83–100%,without significant differences among cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. However,this therapeutic regimen has several contraindications and can cause significant adverse events,which can reduce adherence and impair SVR rates. SOF plus RBV for 24 weeks is another treatment option,with SVR rates of 82–96% among patients without cirrhosis and 62–92% among those with cirrhosis. Finally,SOF plus DCV provides 94–97% SVR rates in non-cirrhotic patients,but 59–69% in those with cirrhosis. The addition of RBV to the regimen of SOF plus DCV increases the SVR rates in cirrhotic patients above 80%,and extending treatment to 24 weeks raises SVR to 90%.

Although HCV genotype 4 constitutes about 20% of HCV infections worldwide, the prevalence in Egypt is more than 90%. We assessed the efficacy and safety of the two direct-acting antiviral drugs ombitasvir, an NS5A inhibitor, and paritaprevir, an NS3/4A protease inhibitor dosed with ritonavir, plus ribavirin in treatment of chronic HCV infection in Egypt. Methods AGATE-II was a phase 3, open-label, partly randomised trial in patients with chronic HCV genotype 4 infection recruited from five academic and hepatology centres in Egypt. Patients were HCV treatment-naive or treatment-experienced with interferon-based regimens. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and had been chronically infected with HCV genotype 4 for at least 6 months with a plasma HCV RNA concentration of more than 1000 IU/mL at screening. Patients without cirrhosis were assigned to receive 12 weeks of 25 mg ombitasvir, 150 mg paritaprevir, and 100 mg ritonavir orally once daily plus weight-based ribavirin. Patients with compensated cirrhosis were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive the same treatment for either 12 weeks or 24 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by previous pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment experience using a web-based interactive response technology system and computer-generated schedules prepared by personnel from the funder's statistics department. Investigators were masked to randomisation schedules and were informed of each patient's assigned treatment by the interactive response technology system immediately after allocation. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a sustained virological response (HCV RNA <15 IU/mL) 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug (SVR12). All patients who received at least one dose of study drugs were included in the primary and safety analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02247401. Findings Between Nov 4, 2014, and March 16, 2015, we screened 182 patients with HCV infection, of whom 160 were eligible for inclusion; 100 patients were assessed as not having cirrhosis and were given 12 weeks of treatment, and 60 patients assessed as having cirrhosis were randomly assigned to the 12-week treatment group (n=31) or the 24-week treatment group (n=29). 94 (94%; 95% CI 88–97) of 100 patients in the without cirrhosis group, 30 (97%; 84–99) of 31 patients in the cirrhosis 12-week treatment group, and 27 (93%; 78–98) of 29 patients in the cirrhosis 24-week treatment group achieved SVR12. The most common adverse events in patients without cirrhosis were headache (41 [41%]) and fatigue (35 [35%]). Fatigue occurred in nine (29%) patients in the cirrhosis 12-week treatment group and 11 (38%) patients in the cirrhosis 24-week treatment group, and headache occurred in nine (29%) patients in the cirrhosis 12-week treatment group and in 10 (35%) patients in the cirrhosis 24-week treatment group. Adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in severity, and laboratory abnormalities were not clinically meaningful. No patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. One serious adverse event in the group without cirrhosis was attributed to study drugs by the investigators; the patient had deep venous thrombosis. Interpretation Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks achieved SVR12 in a high proportion of patients and was well tolerated in Egyptian patients with HCV genotype 4 infection with or without compensated cirrhosis. Extension of treatment to 24 weeks in patients with cirrhosis did not improve the proportion of patients achieving SVR12. A shorter duration regimen could be useful to address the significant burden of HCV genotype 4 infection in patients with compensated cirrhosis.

Velpatasvir (VEL, formerly GS-5816), is a pangenotypic HCV NS5A inhibitor that has demonstrated high SVR rates in patients with genotypes 1-6 HCV infection when used in combination with sofosbuvir (SOF). This Phase 3 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of the fixed dose combination (FDC) of SOF/VEL in HCV infected patients with decompensated liver disease. Methods: Genotype (GT) 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 HCV infected patients with CPT-B cirrhosis were randomized 1:1:1 to receive SOF/VEL (400 mg /100 mg) daily for 12 weeks, SOF/VEL + weight based RBV for 12 weeks, or SOF/VEL for 24 weeks. Patients with prior liver transplant or hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. Results: Of the 267 patients randomized and treated, the majority were treatment experienced (55 %), white (90%), males (70%), with IL28B non-CC (77%). Patients had genotype 1(78% overall, 60% 1a), 2 (4.5%), 3 (15%), 4 (3%) or 6 (<1%) HCV infection. The median CPT score was 8 (range 5-10) and median MELD score was (range 6-24). The SVR12 rates by GT are shown in table 1. SOF/VEL+RBV for 12 weeks resulted in high SVR rates with relapse occurring in 1 (1%) GT1 and 1 (8%) GT3 subjects respectively. A second GT3 patient in the SOF/VEL+RBV 12 Week group had on-treatment breakthrough with pharmacokinetic data consistent with nonadherence. There were no genotype 2, 4 and 6 virologic failures across all treatment arms. Among patients who achieved SVR, 47% and 56% had improvements in CPT and MELD scores by week 12 post EOT largely driven by increases in albumin and decreases in bilirubin. The most common adverse events were fatigue, headache, nausea and (anemia in the RBV containing arm with a median Hgb decrease of 1.4 g/dL). Overall 9 patients discontinued SOF/VEL due to adverse events. A total of 47 (18%) patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) with the most common being hepatic encephalopathy and sepsis; only 1 patient had SAEs assessed as related to SOF/VEL There were 9 deaths: sepsis (3); liver failure (2); cardiopulmonary arrest (2); myocardial infarction (1) and respiratory failure (1); none were assessed as related to study drug. Conclusions: In HCV infected patients with decompensated liver disease, SOF/ VEL+RBV for 12 weeks resulted in an overall SVR rate of 94.3% with high individual SVR rates across all HCV genotypes and resulted in early improvements in liver function.

Unfavorable systemic side-effects of chemotherapeutic agents and susceptibility to the degradation of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which can knock down a specific gene involved in the disease, have hampered their clinical application. So, it could be beneficial to develop an efficient carrier for the stabilization and specific delivery of drugs and siRNA to cells. Targeted nanoparticles have gained considerable attention as an efficient drug and gene delivery system, which is due to their capability in achieving the highest accumulation of cytotoxic agents in tumor tissue, modifiable drug pharmacokinetic-and bio-distribution, improved effectiveness of treatment, and limited sideeffects. Recent studies have shed more light on the advantages of novel drug loaded carrier systems vs free drugs. Most of the animal studies have reported improvement in treatment efficacy and survival rate using novel carrier systems. Targeted delivery may be achieved passively or actively. In passive targeting, no ligand as homing device is used, while targeting is achieved by incorporating the therapeutic agent into a macromolecule or nanoparticle that passively reaches the target organ. However, in active targeting, the therapeutic agent or carrier system is conjugated to a tissue or cell-specific receptor which is overexpressed in a special malignancy using a ligand called a homing device. This review covers a broad spectrum of targeted nanoparticles as therapeutic and nonviral siRNA delivery systems, which are developed for enhanced cellular uptake and targeted gene silencing in vitro and in vivo and their characteristics and opportunities for the clinical applications of drugs and therapeutic siRNA are discussed in this article. Asialoglycoprotein receptors, low-density lipoprotein, ganglioside GM1 cell surface ligand, epidermal growth factor receptor receptors, monoclonal antibodies, retinoic acid receptors, integrin receptors targeted by Arg-Gly-Asp peptide, folate, and transferrin receptors are the most widely studied cell surface receptors which are used for the site specific delivery of drugs and siRNA-based therapeutics in HCC and discussed in detail in this article.",,,26576089,L606985040,10.3748/wjg.v21.i42.12022

Because of this, there is an urgent need to search for novel pathways in sorafenib experienced patients. This review will focus on the role of hypoxia and hypoxiainducible factor alpha (HIF-1α) in cancer development, specifically in HCC. We will discuss the biology of HIF-1α, the pathways with which it interacts, and the function of HIF-1α in HCC. Furthermore, we will review studies highlighting the relevance of HIF-1α in the clinical setting, as well as the pre-clinical data supporting its further investigation.

While post-LT metastasis to bones is described, recurrence in sternum as initial presentation is not yet reported in literature. Case: A 70 year-old caucasian man with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis and HCC status post LT 1-year ago, was seen in transplant clinic for routine follow-up. The explanted liver histopathology showed a viable tumour with vascular invasion into the right lobe measuring 3.5x3.0x2.8 cm, which put him at risk for recurrence. He was stable on current tacrolimus and everolimus based immunosuppression, and his blood work was unremarkable. On physical exam, he was discovered to have a 3-cm soft , palpable, non-tender, immobile lesion on his chest wall. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed 3.4x4.1 cm destructive soft tissue lesion involving the inferior portion of sternum just above xyphoid region. CT guided biopsy of the lesion confirmed HCC. In lieu of his metastatic disease, he was started on Sorafenib 400 mg BID and referred to radiation oncology for radiotherapy. Discussion: Patients with explant tumor characteristics within the currently acknowledged criteria for transplantation are reported to have a recurrence rate of about 8%. The time range from LT to recurrence varies greatly, with one study reporting mean of 12.3 months. The size of primary tumor and number of nodules are strong determinants of recurrece risk after LT. It is believed that metastasis to the bones occurs via portal vein-vertebral vein plexuses (due to either portal thrombus and/or portal hypertension which allows it to bypass through plexus), thus elucidating the more frequent cranio-spinal metastases. Therefore, presence of vascular invasion, especially of the portal system, is one of the major factors related to relapse. Metastatic spread to the bones occurs in 13 to 16% of HCC, however, it infrequently appears as the first manifestation of recurrence. The most common sites of skeletal involvement, in descending order, are vertebrae, pelvis, ribs, skull, and long bones.Radiation therapy is utilized for recurrent unresectable HCC.

New treatment modalities to prolong survival and to minimize the risk of adverse response are desperately needed for patients with advanced HCC. Tumor immunotherapy is a promising, novel treatment strategy that may lead to improvements in both treatment-associated toxicity and outcome. The strategies have developed in part through genomic studies that have yielded candidate target molecules and in part through basic biology studies that have defined the pathways and cell types regulating immune response. Here, we summarize the various types of HCC immunotherapy and argue that the newfound field of HCC immunotherapy might provide critical advantages in the effort to improve prognosis of patients with advanced HCC. Already several immunotherapies, such as tumor-associated antigen therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors and cell transfer immunotherapy, have demonstrated safety and feasibility in HCC patients. Unfortunately, immunotherapy currently has low efficacy in advanced stage HCC patients; overcoming this challenge will place immunotherapy at the forefront of HCC treatment, possibly in the near future.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01658878)",,26420958,L606161761,10.3748/wjg.v21.i36.10314

However, the specific drug delivery to cancer cells is an important issue which should be considered before designing new NPs for in vivo application. It has been shown that cancer cells over-express folate receptor (FR) in order to improve their growth. As normal cells express a significantly lower levels of FR compared to tumor cells, it seems that folate molecules can be used as potent targeting moieties in different nanocarrier-based therapeutic approaches. Moreover, there is evidence which implies folate-conjugated NPs can selectively deliver anti-tumor drugs into cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we will discuss about the efficiency of different folate-conjugated NPs in cancer therapy.",,,26142733,L605097367,10.1007/s13277-015-3706-6

Currently, the most successful HCV infection antiviral therapies reduce the chance of progression towards the advanced phases of the hepatopathy (liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and death). Recently, however, several new direct-acting antivirals against HCV are available or are in an advanced phase of clinical development.Areas covered: This review focuses on beclabuvir, an allosteric non-nucleotide inhibitor of HCV polymerase. The article covers its pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, in addition to its tolerability and safety profile as well as its resistance pattern.Expert opinion: The pharmacokinetic, efficacy and tolerability profile of beclabuvir, as well as its barrier to resistance, are very favorable. In particular, the combination of beclabuvir with asunaprevir and daclatasvir achieves very high rates of viral eradication (about 90%) in patients infected with HCV genotype 1, which is the most common genotype worldwide. Therefore, beclabuvir represents a powerful weapon against HCV infection and has to be considered an optimal option in tailored IFN-free combinations.",,,26156630,L605149374,10.1517/13543784.2015.1059820

Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still diagnosed at intermediate or advanced disease stages, where curative approaches are often not feasible. Among the treatment options available, the molecular targeted agent sorafenib is able to significantly increase overall survival in these patients. Thereafter, up to seven large, randomized phase III clinical trials investigating other molecular therapies in the first-line and second-line settings have failed to improve on the results observed with this agent. Potential reasons for this include intertumour heterogeneity, issues with trial design and a lack of predictive biomarkers of response. During the past 5 years, substantial advances in our knowledge of the human genome have provided a comprehensive picture of commonly mutated genes in patients with HCC. This knowledge has not yet influenced clinical decision-making or current clinical practice guidelines. In this Review the authors summarize the molecular concepts of progression, discuss the potential reasons for clinical trial failure and propose new concepts of drug development, which might lead to clinical implementation of emerging targeted agents.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01507168, NCT02160041)",,26054909,L604830785,10.1038/nrclinonc.2015.103

Ramucirumab is a recombinant IgG1 monoclonal antibody and VEGF receptor-2 antagonist. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ramucirumab in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma following first-line therapy with sorafenib. Methods: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 trial (REACH), patients were enrolled from 154 centres in 27 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had hepatocellular carcinoma with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C disease or stage B disease that was refractory or not amenable to locoregional therapy, had Child-Pugh A liver disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, had previously received sorafenib (stopped because of progression or intolerance), and had adequate haematological and biochemical parameters. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ramucirumab (8 mg/kg) or placebo every 2 weeks, plus best supportive care, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. Randomisation was stratified by geographic region and cause of liver disease with a stratified permuted block method. Patients, medical staff, investigators, and the funder were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01140347. Findings: Between Nov 4, 2010, and April 18, 2013, 565 patients were enrolled, of whom 283 were assigned to ramucirumab and 282 were assigned to placebo. Median overall survival for the ramucirumab group was 9·2 months (95% CI 8·0-10·6) versus 7·6 months (6·0-9·3) for the placebo group (HR 0·87 [95% CI 0·72-1·05]; p=0·14). Grade 3 or greater adverse events occurring in 5% or more of patients in either treatment group were ascites (13 [5%] of 277 patients treated with ramucirumab vs 11 [4%] of 276 patients treated with placebo), hypertension (34 [12%] vs ten [4%]), asthenia (14 [5%] vs five [2%]), malignant neoplasm progression (18 [6%] vs 11 [4%]), increased aspartate aminotransferase concentration (15 [5%] vs 23 [8%]), thrombocytopenia (13 [5%] vs one [<1%]), hyperbilirubinaemia (three [1%] vs 13 [5%]), and increased blood bilirubin (five [2%] vs 14 [5%]). The most frequently reported (≥1%) treatment-emergent serious adverse event of any grade or grade 3 or more was malignant neoplasm progression.

This technique consists of the selective intra-arterial administration of microspheres loaded with a radioactive compound (usually Yttrium(90)), and exerts its therapeutic effect through the radiation carried by these microspheres. A careful and meticulous selection of patients is crucial before performing the radioembolization to correctly perform the procedure and reduce the incidence of complications. Radioembolization is a technically complex and expensive technique, which has only recently entered clinical practice and is supported by scant results from phase III clinical trials. Nevertheless, it may represent a valid alternative to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in the treatment of intermediate-stage HCC patients, as shown by a comparative retrospective assessment that reported a longer time to progression, but not of overall survival, and a more favorable safety profile for radioembolization. In addition, this treatment has reported a higher percentage of tumor shrinkage, if compared to TACE, for pre-transplant downsizing and it represents a promising therapeutic option in patients with large extent of disease and insufficient residual liver volume who are not immediately eligible for surgery.

We investigated whether injections of activated cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells (CD3+/CD56+ and CD3+/CD56- T cells and CD3-/CD56+ natural killer cells) prolongs recurrence-free survival of patients after curative therapy for HCC. Methods We performed a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial of the efficacy and safety of adjuvant immunotherapy with activated CIK cells (created by incubation of patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells with interleukin 2 and an antibody against CD3). The study included 230 patients with HCC treated by surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, or percutaneous ethanol injection at university-affiliated hospitals in Korea. Patients were assigned randomly to receive immunotherapy (injection of 6.4 × 10(9) autologous CIK cells, 16 times during 60 weeks) or no adjuvant therapy (controls). The primary end point was recurrence-free survival; secondary end points included overall survival, cancer-specific survival, and safety. Results The median time of recurrence-free survival was 44.0 months in the immunotherapy group and 30.0 months in the control group (hazard ratio with immunotherapy, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43-0.94; P =.010 by 1-sided log-rank test). Hazard ratios also were lower in the immunotherapy than in the control group for all-cause death (0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.75; P =.008) and cancer-related death (0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.87; P =.02). A significantly higher proportion of patients in the immunotherapy group than in the control group had an adverse event (62% vs 41%; P =.002), but the proportion of patients with serious adverse events did not differ significantly between groups (7.8% vs 3.5%; P =.15).

The present study by Menne et al. evaluated GS-9620 in the HBV Woodchuck animal model demonstrating that short duration treatment with the TLR7 agonist was able to induce a sustained antiviral response which is likely due to the induction of local interferon-alpha and natural killer cell and CD8(+) T cell responses as well as activation of B cells. A striking reduction in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was also observed in the treated animals.

These findings enlighten the role of MET inhibitors in the treatment of advanced HCC. In this paper, we review all ongoing and completed clinical trials regarding this topic.

Tumour progression and subsequent dropout from waiting list have significant impact on the survival. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) controls tumour growth in the treated HCC nodule, however, the risk of tumour development in the untreated liver is increased by simultaneous release of neo-angiogenic factors. Due to its anti-angiogenic effects, Sorafenib delays the progression of HCC. Aim of this study was to determine whether combination of TACE and Sorafenib improves tumour control in HCC patients on waiting list for LT. Methods: Fifty patients were randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio in double-blinded fashion at four centers in Germany and treated with TACE plus either Sorafenib (n = 24) or placebo (n = 26). The end of treatment was development of progressive disease according to mRECIST criteria or LT. The primary endpoint of the trial was the Time-to-Progression (TTP). Other efficacy endpoints were Tumour Response, Progression-free Survival (PFS), and Time-to-LT (TTLT). Results: The median time of treatment was 125 days with Sorafenib and 171 days with the placebo. Fourteen patients (seven from each group) developed tumour progression during the course of the study period. The Hazard Ratio of TTP was 1.106 (95% CI: 0.387, 3.162). The results of the Objective Response Rate, Disease Control Rate, PFS, and TTLT were comparable in both groups.

Methods The C-WORTHY study is a phase 2, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of grazoprevir plus elbasvir with or without ribavirin in patients with HCV; here, we report findings for previously untreated (genotype 1) patients without cirrhosis who were HCV mono-infected or HIV/HCV co-infected. Eligible patients were previously untreated adults aged 18 years or older with chronic HCV genoype 1 infection and HCV RNA at least 10 000 IU/mL in peripheral blood without evidence of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or decompensated liver disease. In part A of the study we randomly assigned HCV-mono-infected patients to receive 12 weeks of grazoprevir (100 mg) plus elbasvir (20 mg or 50 mg) with or without ribavirin (arms A1-3); in part B we assigned HCV-mono-infected patients to 8 or 12 weeks of grazoprevir (100 mg) plus elbasvir (50 mg) with or without ribavirin (arms B1-3) and HIV/HCV co-infected patients to 12 weeks of therapy with or without ribavirin. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving HCV RNA less than 25 IU/mL 12 weeks after end of treatment (SVR12). Randomisation was by presence or absence of ribavirin, 8 or 12 weeks of treatment, and dosage of elbasvir. Patients were stratified by gentoype 1a versus 1b. The patients, investigators, and study site personnel were masked to treatment group assignements but the funder was not. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01717326. Findings 218 patients with HCV mono-infection (n=159) and HIV/HCV co-infection (n=59) were enrolled. SVR12 for patients treated for 12 weeks with or without ribavirin ranged from 93-98% in mono-infected and 87-97% in co-infected patients. SVR12 rates in mono-infected and co-infected patients treated for 12 weeks without ribavirin were 98% (95% CI 88-100; 43/44) and 87% (95% CI 69-96; 26/30), respectively, and with ribavirin were 93% (95% CI 85-97; 79/85) and 97% (95% CI 82-100; 28/29), respectively. Among mono-infected patients with genotype 1a infection treated for 8 weeks, SVR12 was 80% (95% CI 61-92; 24/30). Five of six patients who discontinued early for reasons other than virological failure had HCV RNA less than 25 IU/mL at their last study visit. Virological failure among patients treated for 12 weeks occurred in seven patients (7/188, 4%) and was associated with emergence of resistance-associated variants to one or both drugs. The safety profile of grazoprevir plus elbasvir with or without ribavirin was similar in mono-infected and co-infected patients. No patient discontinued due to an adverse event or laboratory abnormality.

Despite extensive research, the immunopathogenesis is not completely understood. Viral persistence and clinical outcomes following HBV infection depend on viral factors and host factors; including genetic factors that determine a host's immune mechanisms. The primary goal of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment is to eradicate HBV or to at least maintain suppression of HBV replication. Despite recent advances in anti-viral agents for chronic HBV infection, complete eradication of the virus has been difficult to achieve. Agents for the treatment of CHB are divided mainly into two groups: immunomodulating agents and antiviral nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). Although NAs are safe, effective and easily administered orally, their long-term use poses the risk of drug resistance. Currently, international evidence-based guidelines have been developed to support physicians in managing CHB patients. However, treatment of patients with drug resistance is still challenging, as only a few classes of anti-HBV drugs are available and cross-resistance between drugs can occur. In addition, as the currently available genotypic test for detection of drug resistance still has limitations in identifying the different substitutions present in the same viral genome, the development of a new virologic test to overcome this limitation is necessary. Among the predictive factors associated with response to pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) therapy, hepatitis B surface antigen quantification is considered to be a surrogate marker for monitoring response to PEG-IFN. Current practice guidelines stress the importance of profound and durable HBV viral suppression in the treatment of CHB patients. To this end, it is essential to choose a potent antiviral drug with a low risk of resistance for initial treatment of CHB to achieve sustained virological response. This review highlights recent advances in the understanding of the immunopathogenesis of HBV and currently available and developing treatment strategies against HBV infection.",,,25309066,L600461249,10.3748/wjg.v20.i37.13293

Interventional treatments such as TACE, balloon-occluded TACE, drug-eluting bead embolization, radioembolization, and combined therapies including TACE and radiofrequency ablation, continue to evolve, resulting in improved patient prognosis. However, patients with advanced-stage HCC typically receive only chemotherapy with sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, or palliative and conservative therapy. Most patients receive palliative or conservative therapy only, and approximately 50% of patients with HCC are candidates for systemic therapy. However, these patients require therapy that is more effective than sorafenib or conservative treatment. Several researchers try to perform more effective therapies, such as combined therapies (TACE with radiotherapy and sorafenib with TACE), modified TACE for HCC with arterioportal or arteriohepatic vein shunts, TACE based on hepatic hemodynamics, and isolated hepatic perfusion.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of everolimus in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma for whom sorafenib treatment failed. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: EVOLVE-1was a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study conducted among 546 adults with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C hepatocellular carcinoma and Child-Pugh A liver function whose disease progressed during or after sorafenib or who were intolerant of sorafenib. Patients were enrolled from 17 countries between May 2010 and March 2012. Randomization was stratified by region (Asia vs rest of world) and macrovascular invasion (present vs absent). INTERVENTIONS: Everolimus, 7.5mg/d, or matching placebo, both given in combination with best supportive care and continued until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Per the 2:1 randomization scheme, 362 patients were randomized to the everolimus group and 184 patients to the placebo group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end pointwas overall survival. Secondary end points included time to progression and the disease control rate (the percentage of patients with a best overall response of complete or partial response or stable disease). RESULTS: No significant difference in overall survival was seen between treatment groups, with 303 deaths (83.7%) in the everolimus group and 151 deaths (82.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% CI, 0.86-1.27; P = .68; median overall survival, 7.6 months with everolimus, 7.3 months with placebo). Median time to progression with everolimus and placebo was 3.0 months and 2.6 months, respectively (HR, 0.93; 95%CI, 0.75-1.15), and disease control rate was 56.1% and 45.1%, respectively (P = .01). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events for everolimus vs placebo were anemia (7.8%vs 3.3%, respectively), asthenia (7.8%vs 5.5%, respectively), and decreased appetite (6.1%vs 0.5%, respectively). No patients experienced hepatitis C viral flare. Based on central laboratory results, hepatitis B viral reactivation was experienced by 39 patients (29 everolimus, 10 placebo); all cases were asymptomatic, but 3 everolimus recipients discontinued therapy.

In the following, liver transplantation was considered ideal for complete tumor resection and potential cure from primary hepatic malignancies. Several reports of liver transplantation for primary and metastatic liver cancer however showed disappointing results and the strategy was soon dismissed. In 1996, Mazzaferro et al introduced the Milan criteria, offering liver transplantation to patients diagnosed with limited hepatocellular carcinoma. Since then, liver transplantation for malignant disease is an ongoing subject of preclinical and clinical research. In this context, several aspects must be considered: (1) Given the shortage of deceased-donor organs, long-term overall and disease free survival should be comparable with results obtained in patients transplanted for nonmalignant disease; (2) In this regard, living-donor liver transplantation may in selected patients help to solve the ethical dilemma of optimal individual patient treatment vs organ allocation justice; and (3) Ongoing research focusing on perioperative therapy and antiproliferative immunosuppressive regimens may further reduce tumor recurrence in patients transplanted for malignant disease and thus improve overall survival.

After development of sorafenib and its introduction as a therapeutic agent used in the clinic, several critical questions have been raised. Clinical parameters and biomarkers predicting sorafenib efficacy are the most important issues that need to be elucidated. Although it is difficult to know the responders in advance using conventional characteristics of patients, there are specific serum cytokines and/or gene amplification in tumor tissues that have been reported to predict efficacy of sorafenib. Risk and benefits of continuation of sorafenib beyond radiological progression is another issue to consider because no other standard therapy for advanced HCC as yet exists. In addition, effectiveness of the expanded application of sorafenib is still controversial, although a few studies have shed some light on combinational treatment with sorafenib for intermediate-stage HCC. Recently, over 50 relevant drugs have been developed and are currently under investigation. The efficacy of some of these drugs has been extensively examined, but none have demonstrated any superiority over sorafenib, so far. However, there are several drugs that have shown efficacy for treatment after sorafenib failure, and these are proceeding to further studies.

Date of Publication: 1 Apr 2014","2014","53","4","347","359","1 Apr 2014","Background and Objective: Linifanib is a multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which can inhibit members of the vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor families. The objective of this analysis was to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of linifanib in cancer patients. Methods: We pooled 7,351 linifanib plasma concentrations from 1,010 cancer patients enrolled in 13 clinical studies. Population pharmacokinetic modelling was performed using NONMEM version 7.2. The covariates that were screened included the cancer type, co-medications, creatinine clearance, formulation, fed status, liver function markers (bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), albumin, age, sex, race, body weight, surface area and body mass index. Results: A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and disposition best described linifanib pharmacokinetics. An increase in body weight was associated with less than proportional increases in volumes of distribution. Subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma were estimated to have 63 and 86 % larger volumes of distribution, respectively, than subjects with the other cancer types. Females had 25 % slower oral clearance (CL/F) than males, while subjects with colorectal cancer had 41 % faster CL/F than other subjects. For linifanib bioavailability, subjects with refractory acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome had 43 % lower bioavailability, evening doses were associated with 27 % lower bioavailability than morning doses, and administration of linifanib under fed conditions decreased the bioavailability by 14 %. Finally, the oral solution formulation showed two-fold faster absorption than the tablet formulations. Conclusion: The use of mixed-effects modelling allowed robust assessment of the impact of the concomitant effects of body size, different cancer types, formulation, diurnal variation, sex and food on linifanib pharmacokinetics. The developed population pharmacokinetic model describes linifanib concentrations adequately and can be used to conduct simulations or to evaluate the linifanib exposure-response relationship. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,,24307488,L372858868,10.1007/s40262-013-0121-2

In this article, we review emerging antivirals directed at novel targets derived from mechanisms of viral cellular entry, viral replication, viral assembly, and the host immune response, leading to preclinical and clinical trials for possible future therapeutic intervention. The recent therapeutic advances in the development of all categories of HBV inhibitors may pave the way for regimens of finite duration that result in long-lasting control of chronic hepatitis B infection. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

In particular, chronic HBV infection is a predominant risk factor for HCC in Asia and Africa. Hepatic resection and radiofrequency ablation are increasingly used for the curative treatment of HCC, and good local control can be achieved. However, the high rate of recurrence is a major obstacle to improving prognosis. A high viral load of HBV DNA is the most important correctable risk factor for recurrence.

Currently, no effective vaccine is available for HCV infection. Polyethylene glycol interferon-α (PegIFN-α) in combination with ribavirin (RBV) is the standard of care (SOC) for chronic hepatitis C. However, the efficacy of PegIFN-α and RBV combination therapy is less than 50% for genotype 1 HCV, which is the dominant virus in humans. In addition, IFN and RBV have several severe side effects. Therefore, strategies to improve sustained virological response (SVR) rates have been an important focus for clinical physicians. The serine protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2011. The addition of HCV protease inhibitors to the SOC has significantly improved the efficacy of treatments for HCV infection. Several direct-acting antiviral drugs currently in late-stage clinical trials, both with and without peg-IFN and RBV, have several advantages over the previous SOC, including higher specificity and efficacy, fewer side effects, and the ability to be administered orally, and might be optimal regimens in the future. Factors affecting the efficacy of anti-HCV treatments based on IFN-α include the HCV genotype, baseline viral load, virological response during treatment, host IL28B gene polymorphisms and hepatic steatosis.

Although antiviral therapy has been markedly improved by the licensing of direct-acting antivirals, safety, resistance, high costs and difficult-to-treat patients remain important challenges. Areas covered: This article focuses and comments on the recent development of synthetic anti-lipopolysaccharide peptides (SALPs) which bind to highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan/heparan sulfate (HS) on cell surface. HS serves as a primary docking site for several viruses to their respective host cells before the viruses interact with their cell surface receptor(s). In vitro studies have shown that SALPs inhibit entry of HCV without cell toxicity. Expert opinion: SALPs prevent viral infection in cell culture model systems. Treatment studies of established HCV infection in cell culture models as well as proof-of-concept and safety studies in animal models are needed to evaluate their potential for drug development. The mechanism of action of SALPs as entry inhibitors suggests a potential application for HCV-infected patients to prevent reinfection of the liver graft in liver transplantation. Potential limitations may include high doses to obtain an antiviral effect and a target which is widely expressed and has a key function in cell physiology. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.",,,23634817,L369129056,10.1517/13543784.2013.794218

A complementary strategy is to target the host cellular factors that support the HCV life cycle. Several studies, including RNA interference screens, demonstrated that HCV depends on dozens, if not hundreds, of cellular proteins to complete its life cycle.

There are currently no global guidelines regarding the dose, choice or combination of cytotoxic agents for TACE; therefore it is difficult to compare data from different TACE studies. Superselective TACE with lipiodol is the primary TACE procedure that offers satisfactory levels of local control with a lower risk of complications. Approximately 40-70% of patients with HCC with tumours sized 4-5 cm or less attained complete tumour necrosis or remained local recurrence free for 3 years or longer following TACE. The early identification of unresponsiveness to TACE is important to allow for a timely switch to alternative therapies. The use of novel embolizing materials in TACE such as drug-eluting beads and radioembolization is likely to have beneficial effects.

Date of Publication: 2012","2012","12","9","1045","1061","2012","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a global health problem and responsible for up to 500.000 deaths annually. It usually occurs secondary to infections with hepatitis B or C viruses, alcohol consumption, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or hereditary liver diseases. The prognosis for patients with advanced disease is dismal; therefore, new strategies to prevent or treat this malignancy are urgently needed. Over recent years, several molecular pathways have been identified contributing to the molecular pathogenesis of this devastating disease, among them the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. mTOR is effectively inhibited by rapamycin and its derivatives such as temsirolimus and everolimus. The anti-tumor activity of rapamycin was identified more than 30 years ago in a screen performed at the National Cancer Institute, but was subsequently not developed for cancer treatment. In the 1990s, activation of the mTOR pathway was recognized in various malignancies spurring again the interest in mTOR inhibitors for anti-cancer treatment. In 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus, for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Currently, several clinical studies are underway to define the role of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this review is to outline the role of mTOR for hepatocarcinogenesis. We will also discuss the latest preclinical and clinical data of mTOR inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of HCC. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00328770, NCT00355862, NCT00390195, NCT00467194, NCT00516165, NCT00554125, NCT00775073, NCT00828594, NCT00999882, NCT01005199, NCT01008917, NCT01009801, NCT01010126, NCT01013519, NCT01035229, NCT01079767, NCT01183663, NCT01251458, NCT01281943, NCT01335074)",,22873368,L368151539,10.2174/15680096112091045

Date of Publication: 2012","2012","12","9","1119","1128","2012","The poor prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with its high rate of recurrence in the cirrhotic liver. Therefore, development of effective strategies for preventing recurrence and secondary tumors will improve the clinical outcome of HCC patients. A malfunction of the retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα) due to phosphorylation by the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway is profoundly associated with liver carcinogenesis, and thus, may be a promising target for HCC chemoprevention. Acyclic retinoid (ACR), which inhibits Ras-MAPK activation and RXRα phosphorylation, successfully prevents HCC recurrence, thus improving patient survival. The fundamental concept of HCC chemoprevention by ACR is ""clonal deletion,"" which is defined as the removal of latent malignant clones from the liver before they expand into clinically detectable HCC. ""Combination chemoprevention"" using ACR as a key drug holds great promise of a new effective strategy for the prevention of HCC because of its synergism. ACR is also expected to prevent the development of HCC in obese people, who are at an increased risk to HCC, because this agent significantly inhibits obesity-related liver tumorigenesis in the rodent model. Here, we review the detailed effects of ACR on preventing HCC development, especially based on the results of our basic and clinical research. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",,,22873214,L368151544,10.2174/156800912803987940

Date of Publication: 2012","2012","18","46","6709","6711","2012","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a dreadful cancer and a major cause of death among patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. The apparent alterations in a diversity of intracellular pathways found in HCC has set the rational for developing molecular-directed drugs that simultaneously inhibit multiple pathways, such as the multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib. However, recently this concept has been challenged by showing that HCC is heavily dependent on a single oncogene designated late SV-40 factor (LSF), a transcription factor that is over-expressed in liver cancer cells and that its expression is strongly correlated with tumor grade and aggressiveness. Furthermore, using an intensive screening for drugs that inhibit LSF activity, Grant et al have found a molecule designated factor quinolinone inhibitor 1 that can specifically block the ability of LSF to bind its target promoters, resulting in a massive death of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. The innovative findings of HCC representing ""oncogene addiction"" to LSF and the ability of a single molecule to block the activity of this oncogene resulting in tumor abolishment are encouraging and provide us with the hope that the ""Achilles heel"" of HCC has been found. © 2012 Baishideng.

Date of Publication: July 14, 2011","2011","17","26","3075","3081","July 14, 2011","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most common cancer diseases worldwide. Arterial hypervascularisation is an essential step for HCC tumorigenesis and can be targeted by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). This interventional method is the standard treatment for patients with intermediate stage HCC, but is also applied as ""bridging"" therapy for patients awaiting liver transplantation in many centers worldwide. Usually the devascularization effect induced by TACE is transient, consequently resulting in repeated cycles of TACE every 4-8 wk. Despite documented survival benefits, TACE can also induce the up-regulation of proangiogenic and growth factors, which might contribute to accelerated progression in patients with incomplete response. In 2007, sorafenib, a multi-tyrosine kinase and angiogenesis inhibitor, was approved as the first systemic treatment for advanced stage HCC. Other active targeted compounds, either inhibitors of angiogenesis and/or growth factors, are currently being investigated in numerous clinical trials. To overcome revascularisation or tumor progression under TACE treatment it seems therefore attractive to combine TACE with systemic targeted agents, which might theoretically block the effects of proangiogenic and growth factors. Over the last 12 mo, several retrospective or prospective cohort studies combining TACE and sorafenib have been published. Nevertheless, robust results of the efficacy and tolerability of such combination strategies as proven by randomized, controlled trials are awaited in the next two years. © 2011 Baishideng.

Date of Publication: 17 Nov 2010","2010","304","19","2154","2160","17 Nov 2010","Context: In a randomized phase 3 trial, 400 mg of sorafenib twice daily prolonged overall survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Child-Pugh A disease. In a phase 1 study, sorafenib combined with doxorubicin, 60 mg/m(2), was well tolerated by patients with refractory solid tumors. The combination of sorafenib and doxorubicin in patients with advanced HCC has not been evaluated in a phase 2 or 3 trial. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxorubicin plus sorafenib compared with doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A disease. Design, Setting, and Patients: In a double-blind phase 2 multinational study, conducted from April 2005 to October 2006, 96 patients (76% male; median age, 65 years [range, 38-82 years]) with advanced HCC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, Child-Pugh A status, and no prior systemic therapy were randomly assigned to receive 60 mg/m(2) of doxorubicin intravenously every 21 days plus either 400 mg of sorafenib or placebo orally twice a day. The date of the last patient's follow-up was April 2008. Main Outcome Measure: Time to progression as determined by independent review. Results: Following complete accrual, an unplanned early analysis for efficacy was performed by the independent data monitoring committee, so the trial was halted. The 2 patients remaining in the placebo group at that time were offered sorafenib. Based on 51 progressions, 63 deaths, and 70 events for progression-free survival, median time to progression was 6.4 months in the sorafenib-doxorubicin group (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8-9.2), and 2.8 months (95% CI, 1.6-5) in the doxorubicin-placebo monotherapy group (P=.02). Median overall survival was 13.7 months (95% CI, 8.9-not reached) and 6.5 months (95% CI, 4.5-9.9; P=.006), and progression-free survival was 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.6-8.6) and 2.7 months (95% CI, 1.4-2.8) in these groups, respectively (P=.006). Toxicity profiles were similar to those for the single agents. Conclusions: Among patients with advanced HCC, treatment with sorafenib plus doxorubicin compared with doxorubicin monotherapy resulted in greater median time to progression, overall survival, and progression-free survival. The degree to which this improvement may represent synergism between sorafenib and doxorubicin remains to be defined. The combination of sorafenib and doxorubicin is not yet indicated for routine clinical use. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00108953 ©2010 American Medical Association.

Date of Publication: March 2010","2010","45","3","133","141","March 2010","Objectives: To prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined unenhanced and gadoxetic acid disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging compared with unenhanced MR imaging and triphasic contrast-enhanced spiral computed tomography (CT) for the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions. Materials and Methods: The study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at each of the 15 centers involved in the study, and informed written consent was given by all patients. In total, 178 patients with suspected focal hepatic lesions (based, in most patients, on CT, tumor marker and ultrasound examinations) underwent combined MR imaging with a single, rapid injection of Gd-EOB-DTPA 0.025 mmol/kg, including T1-weighted dynamic and delayed MR images 20 to 40 minutes postinjection. Triphasic contrast-enhanced CT, the comparator examination, was performed within 4 weeks of MR imaging. Standard of references (SOR) were resection histopathology and intraoperative ultrasonography, or combined CT during arterial portography and CT hepatic arteriography; in cases where, although the major lesions were treated, some lesion(s) were not treated, follow-up superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced MR imaging was additionally performed. All images were assessed for differences in lesion detection and characterization (specific lesion type) by on-site readers and 3, blinded (off-site) reviewers. All adverse events (AEs) occurring within 72 hours after Gd-EOB-DTPA administration were reported. Results: Overall, 9.6% of patients who received Gd-EOB-DTPA reported 21 drug-related AEs. A total of 151 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Combined MR imaging showed statistically higher sensitivity in lesion detection (67.5%-79.5%) than unenhanced MR imaging (46.5%-59.1%; P < 0.05 for all). Combined MR imaging also showed higher sensitivity in lesion detection than CT (61.1%-73.0%), with the results being statistically significant (P < 0.05) for on-site readers and 2 of 3 blinded readers. Higher sensitivity in lesion detection with combined MR imaging compared with CT was also clearly demonstrated in the following subgroups: lesions with a diameter ≤20 mm (lesions ≤10 mm: 38.0%-55.4% vs. 26.1%-47.3%, respectively; lesions 10-20 mm: 71.1%-87.3% vs. 65.7%-78.4%, respectively); in cirrhotic patients (64.5%-75.4% vs. 54.5%-70.3%, respectively); and in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (66.6%-78.6% vs. 59.1%-71.6%, respectively). Combined MR imaging demonstrated a higher proportion of correctly characterized lesions (50.5%-72.1%) than unenhanced MR imaging (30.2%-50.0%; P < 0.05 for all), whereas there were no significant differences compared with CT (49.0%-68.1%), except for one blinded reader (P < 0.05). Conclusion: In this study, hepatocyte-specific Gd-EOB-DTPA was shown to be safe and to improve the detection and characterization of focal hepatic lesions compared with unenhanced MR imaging. When compared with spiral CT, Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI seems to be beneficial especially for the detection for smaller lesions or hepatocellular carcinoma underlying cirrhotic liver.

This paper examines the scientific and ethical issues surrounding chimpanzee hepatitis C research, and concludes that claims of the necessity of chimpanzees in historical and future hepatitis C research are exaggerated and unjustifiable, respectively. The chimpanzee model has several major scientific, ethical, economic and practical caveats. It has made a relatively negligible contribution to knowledge of, and tangible progress against, the hepatitis C virus compared to non-chimpanzee research, and must be considered scientifically redundant, given the array of alternative methods of inquiry now available. The continuation of chimpanzee use in hepatitis C research adversely affects scientific progress, as well as chimpanzees and humans in need of treatment.

It also participates in processes related to carcinogenesis such as inhibition of tumor formation and regression. Scientific data accumulated so far using experimental animal models and from clinical studies devoted to investigating the effects of Se confirm strong relationship or correlation between Se supplementation and tumor frequency of prostate, lungs, liver and colon. However, details of mechanisms of action of Se in modulation of carcinogenesis and cancer prevention are not yet fully elucidated. It is not clear yet whether Se deficiency itself is a cancer risk factor or whether it helps an already present cancer to progress. Additionally, the effects of other factors such as age, gender, life style, geographic location, comorbidities and use of drugs, are not clear. Despite the fact that some positive results were obtained with Se supplementation, it is necessary to verify these findings in more controlled experimental models including clinical studies.
